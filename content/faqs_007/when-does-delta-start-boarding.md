<p>Delta Air Lines is one of the world’s largest airlines and the go-to choice for many travelers. It offers a wide range of flights, from short-haul domestic flights to long-haul international journeys. But when does Delta start boarding? Well, the answer depends on several factors, such as the type of flight you’re taking, the time of day, and other considerations. Here, we’ll take a look at the different scenarios, so you’ll know exactly when to show up and be ready to board. </p>

<h2>Domestic Flights</h2>

<p>Delta typically starts boarding domestic flights at least 30 minutes before the scheduled departure time. This means that you should arrive at the gate at least 20 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time. This gives you plenty of time to check in and get through the airport security line. If you’re flying on a smaller plane, you may be able to board even earlier. </p>

<h2>International Flights</h2>

<p>The boarding process for international flights is typically more complex than for domestic flights. Delta typically starts boarding international flights at least 45 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time. This gives travelers enough time to check in, get through the airport security line, and clear customs. </p>

<h2>Early Boarding</h2>

<p>Delta offers several options for those who want to board their flight early. Passengers who are Gold, Platinum, or Diamond Medallion members (as well as those traveling in first class or business class) can board the flight early. Additionally, Delta offers its Early Boarding program. Passengers who pay a fee can board the plane ahead of everyone else. </p>

<h2>On-Time Boarding</h2>

<p>Delta does its best to ensure that all of its flights depart on time. Once the boarding process has begun, Delta will typically close the doors five minutes before the scheduled departure time. This means that passengers must be at the gate and ready to board before the doors close. </p>

<h2>Delayed Boarding</h2>

<p>Sometimes, Delta flights may be delayed due to a variety of reasons, including weather, mechanical issues, or air traffic control issues. In such cases, the airline will do its best to make up for the delay by rebooking passengers onto other flights or providing other accommodations. However, the boarding process may be delayed until the airline can determine the best course of action. </p>
