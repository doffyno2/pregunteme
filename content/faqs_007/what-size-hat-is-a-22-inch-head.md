We often hear people asking “what size hat is a 22 inch head?” Finding the right size hat for your head can be a tricky task. But, with the right measurement and a few tips, you can easily find the size of hat that fits you perfectly.

<h2>How to Measure Head Size for a Hat</h2>

Before you can find the right size hat for a 22 inch head, you need to measure your head circumference. To do this, you will need a flexible measuring tape or a string. Place the measuring tape or string around your head, just above your ears and eyebrows. Make sure that the tape or string is not too tight or too loose. Then, measure the length of the tape or string and compare it with the hat sizing chart.

<h2>Hat Sizing Chart</h2>

The hat sizing chart is a helpful guide that shows you which size hat is best for your head size. Here’s a general hat size chart for reference:
