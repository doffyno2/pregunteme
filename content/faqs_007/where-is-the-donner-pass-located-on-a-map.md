Donner Pass is a mountain pass located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California, USA. It is situated on the California-Nevada border and is an important route for both railroads and highways. It is named after the ill-fated Donner Party, a group of American pioneers who were stranded in the area in the winter of 1846-47.

<h2>History of Donner Pass</h2>

Donner Pass was discovered in 1844 by a group of surveyors led by Edward Kern. The group was sent west by John C. Fremont, the explorer and one of the first non-Native Americans to explore the area. The pass was named after the Donner Party, whose ill-fated journey westward was halted by the pass. The pass was originally used by Native Americans, who used it as a trade route between the Great Basin and California. 

In 1846, the Donner Party was attempting to cross the pass when they were stranded in the winter for four months. The party made the decision to eat their dead in order to survive, a tragedy that has become one of the most infamous stories of American pioneer history. 

In the decades that followed, the pass became an important route for settlers heading westward. In 1868, the Central Pacific Railroad completed the first transcontinental railroad, with the tracks passing through Donner Pass.
