<h2>Steps to Make a Dog Lick a Man's Ass</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Make sure you have the right dog</h3>

<p>The first step in making a dog lick a man's ass is to make sure you have the right kind of dog. Some dogs are just not comfortable with this type of activity. If you want your dog to be comfortable with licking your ass, then you need to pick the right breed. Some breeds, such as Labradors and Golden Retrievers, are particularly well-suited to this type of activity. Other breeds, such as Chihuahuas, may not be as comfortable with it.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Train your dog</h3>
<p>Once you have the right breed of dog, it is time to start training them. You can do this in a number of ways. First, you should get your dog used to being around your ass by having them stand close to it while you are sitting or lying down. You should also reward your dog with treats when they do something you want them to do. This will help them to associate positive behaviors with the activity.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Practice with your dog</h3>
<p>Once your dog is comfortable being around your ass, it is time to start practicing. To do this, you will want to put a leash on your dog and have them follow you around. As you walk, you should encourage them to lick your ass with verbal cues such as “lick” or “taste.” If your dog does not seem to understand the command, you can use a dog training collar to give them a gentle shock. This will help them to associate the command with the desired behavior.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Clean up afterwards</h3>
<p>Once your dog has finished licking your ass, you will want to make sure that you clean up afterwards. This is important to help prevent any infections or rashes from occurring. You should use a towel to wipe down the area and make sure that it is clean. You should also give your dog a bath afterwards to make sure that they are clean as well.</p>
