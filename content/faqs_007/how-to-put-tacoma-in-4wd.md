<p>When you own a Toyota Tacoma, you know that you have a truck that is capable of off-roading and taking on different terrains. But do you know how to put your Tacoma in 4WD? If not, don’t worry. We’ll show you how.</p>

<h2>What is 4WD?</h2>

<p>4WD stands for four-wheel drive. When your Tacoma is in 4WD, the power from the engine is sent to all four wheels instead of just two. This makes your Tacoma more stable and gives it more traction when driving on slippery surfaces and other terrains, such as sand, mud, snow, and rocks. It also helps to reduce wheel spin so that you can keep your vehicle under control.</p>

<h2>How to Put Your Tacoma in 4WD</h2>

<p>Putting your Tacoma in 4WD is a simple process that can be done in just a few steps. Here’s what you need to do:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make sure that you are on a flat surface and that your Tacoma is in park.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Turn the ignition key to the on position.</li>

<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shift the gear selector to 4WD low or 4WD high.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Press the 4WD button again to turn off the 4WD.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have followed these steps, your Tacoma should be in 4WD. It is important to remember that the 4WD should only be used when driving on slippery surfaces or other terrains. It should not be used when driving on asphalt or concrete roads.</p>
