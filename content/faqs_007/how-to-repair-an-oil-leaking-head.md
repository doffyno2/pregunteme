<p>Repairing an oil leaking head is not a difficult task, but it requires special attention to detail and an understanding of how engines work. Before attempting to repair an oil leaking head, it is important to make sure that the cause of the leak is determined accurately. This article will provide detailed instructions on how to repair an oil leaking head.</p>

<h2>Assessing the Problem</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing an oil leaking head is to assess the problem. An experienced mechanic should be able to inspect the engine and determine the source of the leak. If the source of the leak is not obvious, it may be necessary to use a pressure tester to check for leaks. Once the source of the leak has been determined, the necessary repairs can begin.</p>

<h2>Removing the Cylinder Head</h2>

<p>The next step in repairing an oil leaking head is to remove the cylinder head. The cylinder head is located on the top of the engine and is held in place by several bolts. It is important to ensure that all of the bolts are loosened and removed before attempting to remove the cylinder head. It is also important to ensure that all of the gaskets and seals are removed carefully to prevent further damage to the engine.</p>
