<p>When it comes to making sure that your little one stays healthy and hydrated, it is important to choose the right type of water. But with the myriad of options on the market, it can be difficult to decide which type of water is best for your baby. Nursery water and bottled water are often confused for one another, so it is important to understand the differences between the two.</p>

<h2>What Is Nursery Water?</h2>

<p>Nursery water is specifically designed for babies, and is the only type of water that should be given to babies under the age of six months. It is purified using advanced purification processes, such as reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light. It is also free of fluoride and contains fewer impurities than tap water. Nursery water is available both in gallon containers as well as ready-to-feed infant formula bottles.</p>

<h2>What Is Bottled Water?</h2>

<p>Bottled water is any type of water that is packaged and sold in a bottle or container. It can be either spring water, purified water, or mineral water. Spring water is sourced from an underground formation and has not been treated. Purified water is treated to remove impurities, while mineral water contains naturally occurring minerals. Some bottled waters are also fortified with additional nutrients, such as calcium and magnesium.</p>

<h2>What Are The Differences Between The Two?</h2>

<p>The primary difference between nursery water and bottled water is the way they are treated. Nursery water is purified using advanced purification processes, while bottled water can be either spring, purified, or mineral water. Nursery water is also free of fluoride, while some bottled waters may contain fluoride. Additionally, some bottled waters may be fortified with additional nutrients, while nursery water does not contain any added nutrients.</p>

<h2>Which Is Better For My Baby?</h2>

<p>Nursery water is the best choice for babies under the age of six months. It is the only type of water specifically designed for babies, and is free of fluoride and other impurities. Bottled water can also be a safe choice for babies, but it is important to read the label carefully to ensure that it does not contain any added nutrients or fluoride. It is also important to check the expiration date to ensure that it is still safe to drink.</p>
