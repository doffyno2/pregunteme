<p>S'mores are a classic summer treat that are usually made with graham crackers, melted chocolate, and marshmallows. But what if you don't have graham crackers on hand? Don't worry, you can still enjoy a delicious s'more even without the traditional ingredients. Here are some creative ways to make s'mores without graham crackers.</p>

<h2>S'mores with Pretzels</h2>

<p>Using pretzels as the base for your s'more is a great way to still get the crunchy texture of a graham cracker without having to search for it. To make your s'more with pretzels, start by breaking the pretzels into small pieces and place them in the bottom of a shallow dish. Then break the chocolate bar into pieces and place them on top of the pretzel pieces. Microwave the dish for about 30 seconds until the chocolate is melted. Place a marshmallow on top of the melted chocolate and microwave for an additional 10-15 seconds until the marshmallow begins to puff up. Take the dish out of the microwave and top with another pretzel. Enjoy your s'more with pretzels!</p>

<h2>S'mores with Cookies</h2>

<p>Cookies make a great substitute for graham crackers in s'mores. You can use any type of cookie, but it's best to use a chocolate cookie so that it pairs well with the chocolate bar. Place the cookie on a plate and top with a piece of chocolate. Microwave for about 30 seconds until the chocolate is melted. Place a marshmallow on top of the melted chocolate and microwave for an additional 10-15 seconds until the marshmallow begins to puff up. Top with another cookie and enjoy your s'more with cookies!</p>

<h2>S'mores with Waffle Cones</h2>

<p>Waffle cones are a great substitute for graham crackers in s'mores. Fill the bottom of the cone with your favorite chocolate bar. Place a marshmallow in the center and microwave for about 20 seconds until the marshmallow starts to expand and the chocolate bar is melted. Top with another piece of chocolate and enjoy your s'more with waffle cones!</p>

<h2>S'mores with Pancake Mix</h2>

<p>Pancake mix can be used to make a crispy base for your s'more. Start by mixing the pancake mix according to the package instructions. Spray a small skillet or griddle with non-stick cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Pour the pancake mix into the skillet and cook for about 2 minutes until the edges start to turn golden brown. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Place a piece of chocolate in the center of the pancake and top with a marshmallow. Microwave for about 20 seconds until the marshmallow starts to puff up and the chocolate is melted. Enjoy your s'more with pancake mix!</p>
