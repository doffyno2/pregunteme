Bobcat scat is the droppings left behind by a bobcat, a wild medium-sized cat found in North America. Bobcats are solitary, secretive creatures and they are surprisingly hard to spot in the wild. However, their scat can be an indicator of their presence in an area. It is important to be able to identify bobcat scat not just as a sign of bobcat activity, but also to distinguish it from other feline scat, such as that of domestic cats, lynx, and cougars.

The texture of the scat is usually coarse and it may contain pieces of fur or feathers. Bobcat scat may also contain bones, teeth, and claws, indicating that the bobcat has been hunting and eating small animals.
