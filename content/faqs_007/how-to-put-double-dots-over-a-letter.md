<h2>What Are Double Dots Over a Letter?</h2>
Double dots over a letter, also known as umlauts, are accent marks that are used in some written languages, such as German and Swedish. Umlauts are two dots placed over a letter, usually a vowel, to indicate a different sound. For example, in the German language, the letter “a” with two dots over it is pronounced like the “o” in “hot”.

<h2>Why Are Double Dots Used?</h2>
Umlauts are used in some languages to indicate that a letter should be pronounced differently than it would be without the accent mark. In German and Swedish, umlauts are used to indicate that a vowel should be pronounced with a more open sound. Umlauts can also be used to indicate that a letter should be pronounced with a different tone.

<h2>How to Type Double Dots Over a Letter</h2>
Typing umlauts on a computer or smartphone can be done in a few different ways. On a Windows PC, you can press the “Alt” key and then type a four-digit code on the numeric keypad.
