To help you determine what size lacrosse stick is right for your 10 year old, we’ve put together this comprehensive guide. We’ll cover the different lacrosse stick lengths, the types of sticks available, and the importance of finding the right size. Let’s get started.

<h2>What Is the Standard Length of a Lacrosse Stick? </h2>

The standard length of a lacrosse stick is 40” (102 cm). This is the length that is typically used by experienced and adult players. However, this size is not suitable for all ages, so it’s important to consider the age and skill level of your 10 year old when selecting a lacrosse stick. 

<h2>What Is the Best Lacrosse Stick Length for a 10 Year Old? </h2>

The best lacrosse stick length for a 10 year old is 36” (91 cm). This size is suitable for younger players aged 8-10 as it is shorter and lighter than the standard adult size.

<h2>What Are the Different Types of Lacrosse Sticks? </h2>

There are three main types of lacrosse sticks that are available to choose from: attack sticks, defensive sticks, and goalie sticks. 

<h3>Attack Sticks </h3>

Attack sticks are the most commonly used type of lacrosse stick. They are used by players in the offensive position and typically have a shallow pocket to help improve ball control. Attack sticks are usually made from lightweight materials, making them easier to maneuver and allowing for better ball control. 

<h3>Defensive Sticks</h3>

Defensive sticks are larger and heavier than attack sticks, making them better suited to defensive play. They have a deeper pocket and are designed to provide increased power when clearing the ball. Additionally, they are often longer than attack sticks, making them easier to reach the ball when it is further away.

<h3>Goalie Sticks</h3>

Goalie sticks are the largest type of lacrosse stick and are designed specifically for goalkeepers. They are made from strong and durable materials, making them better suited to blocking shots and deflecting balls away from the goal. Additionally, they have a deep pocket which helps catch shots and prevent them from entering the goal.
