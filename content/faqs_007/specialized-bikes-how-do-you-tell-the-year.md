<p>Whether you're an avid cyclist or just someone who loves riding their bike on the weekends, it's important to know the year of your bike. This is especially important for specialized bikes, as they often have unique features that vary from year to year. Fortunately, there are a few different ways you can tell the year of a specialized bike.</p>

<h2>Check The Serial Number</h2> 

<p>The most reliable way to tell the year of your specialized bike is to check the serial number. Each bike has a unique serial number that can be used to identify the bike's year. You can typically find this number stamped onto the underside of the bottom bracket of the frame. Once you have the serial number, you can use an online serial number decoder to determine the year of the bike.</p>

<h2>Check The Components</h2> 

<p>If you don't know the serial number of your specialized bike, or if the serial number isn't helping you to identify the year, you can try looking at the components. Different components are typically released in different years, so you can use the components to determine the approximate year of the bike. The components to look for include the brakes, derailleurs, shifters, cranksets, and wheels.</p>

<h2>Check The Paint</h2> 

<p>Another way to identify the age of your specialized bike is to look at the paint. Older bikes tend to have more faded, dull paint, while newer bikes tend to have brighter and more vibrant paint. You can also look at the decals on the frame, as they can also be used to determine the approximate year of the bike.</p>

<h2>Check The Catalogs</h2> 

<p>Finally, you can use online catalogs of specialized bikes to help you identify the year of your bike. Many of these catalogs contain detailed information on each bike, including the components and other features. By looking through the catalogs, you should be able to find a bike that is similar to yours and determine the year.</p>
