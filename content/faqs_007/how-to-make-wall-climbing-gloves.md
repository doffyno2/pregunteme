Wall climbing gloves are critical for anyone who takes climbing seriously. They protect your hands from scrapes and cuts, provide extra grip and make it easier to hold onto the wall for longer periods of time. Here are some tips for making your own wall climbing gloves.

<h2>Materials Needed</h2>

To make wall climbing gloves, you will need the following materials:

<ul>
	<li>Leather</li>
	<li>Elastic</li>
	<li>Thread</li>
	<li>Scissors</li>
	<li>Sewing machine</li>
	<li>Grip tape</li>
	<li>Padding</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps to Make Wall Climbing Gloves</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Cut the Leather</h3>

The first step is to cut the leather into two pieces. You want the pieces to be slightly larger than your hand so that they will fit comfortably. Make sure to leave enough room to add the padding and elastic.

<h3>Step 2: Sew the Pieces Together</h3>

Once you have cut the pieces, use a sewing machine to sew them together. Make sure to make the stitches tight and secure.

<h3>Step 3: Add the Elastic</h3>

Next, add the elastic to the wrist area. This will help keep the gloves secure and snug on your hands.

<h3>Step 4: Add the Grip Tape</h3>

The grip tape will provide extra grip when you're climbing. Cut the tape into strips and attach it to the palms of the gloves.

<h3>Step 5: Add the Padding</h3>

Finally, add the padding to the gloves. This will provide extra protection for your hands and make the gloves more comfortable.
