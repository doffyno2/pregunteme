<p>One of the most common questions pet owners ask their veterinarians is whether or not a particular medication will cause the death of their beloved pet. Rimadyl is one of the most widely prescribed medications for canine arthritis and joint pain relief, and due to its popularity, there are many pet owners who are worried about the potential for Rimadyl to be fatal to their dogs. </p>

<p>Rimadyl, also known by its generic name carprofen, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to reduce inflammation and pain associated with arthritis and other joint conditions in dogs. It was developed by Pfizer in the 1990s and is currently available as a chewable tablet, flavored liquid suspension, or injection. </p>

<p>The potential for Rimadyl to be fatal in dogs is based on the fact that any NSAID can be dangerous when taken in large doses or used for extended periods of time. As with any medication, there is always the potential for side effects, and Rimadyl is no exception. The most common side effects of Rimadyl include vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and increased thirst. In rare cases, Rimadyl can cause liver and kidney damage, which can be fatal. </p>

<p>In order to reduce the risk of side effects, it is important to follow your veterinarian’s instructions for dosing and administration. Rimadyl should never be given in higher doses than what is prescribed, as this can increase the risk of side effects. It is also important to monitor your dog’s response to Rimadyl, as any signs of side effects should be reported to your veterinarian immediately. </p>

<p>It is also important to note that Rimadyl should never be given to a dog that is pregnant or nursing. Additionally, Rimadyl should not be given to dogs that are taking other medications, as there is the potential for dangerous interactions. Your veterinarian will be able to advise you on the best course of action for your pet. </p>
