<h2>What Does Burning Your Hair with a Lighter Do?</h2>

When you burn your hair with a lighter, it can result in a variety of symptoms. Depending on the severity of the burn, you may experience anything from mild discomfort to severe pain. The burned area may also appear red and inflamed. You may also see some discoloration of the affected area.

The heat from the lighter can also cause your hair to break off or even fall out. This is especially true if the burn is severe. In extreme cases, you may even experience permanent hair loss. 

<h2>What Causes Hair Burns from Lighters?</h2>

Hair burns from lighters are usually caused by direct contact between the flame and your hair. This can happen if you’re not careful when lighting a cigarette or cigar. It can also happen if you’re using a lighter to burn off split ends or remove tangles from your hair. 

It’s also possible to get hair burns from indirect contact with the flame. This can happen if you’re using a curling iron or other heated styling tool. If the tool is too hot or is used improperly, it can cause your hair to burn.

<h2>How to Prevent Hair Burns from Lighters</h2>

The best way to prevent hair burns from lighters is to be careful when using them. Before lighting a cigarette or cigar, make sure that your hair is out of the way. This will help prevent any accidental contact between the flame and your hair.

<h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>

If the burn is severe or if it doesn’t seem to be improving, you should see a doctor. A doctor can help assess the severity of the burn and provide treatment if necessary. 

Your doctor may also recommend that you take antibiotics to prevent infection. They may also suggest using a steroid cream to reduce inflammation. In some cases, a doctor may prescribe oral medications to help reduce pain and inflammation.
