Traveling can be a hassle, especially when it comes to security checkpoints. To make things simpler and quicker, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) created the Known Traveler Number (KTN) program. This program allows travelers to register for a known traveler number and use it when traveling to speed up their security checks. In this article, we'll explain everything you need to know about the Known Traveler Number, including how to find it on your card.

<h2>What Is a Known Traveler Number? </h2>

A Known Traveler Number (KTN) is a unique, nine-digit identification number issued to individuals enrolled in the TSA's PreCheck and Global Entry programs. The KTN is used to expedite the security screening process at airports, allowing travelers to move quickly through security and avoid long lines. The KTN is linked to the traveler's name, date of birth, and other personal information, which is used to verify their identity and eligibility for the program. 

<h2>How Do You Get a Known Traveler Number? </h2>

To get a Known Traveler Number, travelers must enroll in either the TSA PreCheck or Global Entry program. TSA PreCheck is available to US citizens, US nationals, and lawful permanent residents. To enroll, applicants must complete an online application, provide personal and travel information, and pay a non-refundable application fee. Once approved, applicants will receive their KTN via email or mail. 

Global Entry is available to US citizens, US nationals, and lawful permanent residents, as well as citizens of certain countries. To enroll, applicants must complete an online application, provide personal and travel information, and pay a non-refundable application fee. If approved, applicants will receive a Global Entry card with their KTN printed on it. 

<h2>Where Is Your Known Traveler Number Located on Your Card? </h2>

Your Known Traveler Number (KTN) is printed on your TSA PreCheck or Global Entry card. The KTN is located in the center of the card, near the bottom, and is nine digits long. It is important to note that the KTN is case-sensitive, so make sure you enter the exact numbers as they appear on your card.

<h2>How to Use Your Known Traveler Number? </h2>

Once you have obtained your Known Traveler Number, you can use it when booking flights to expedite your security screening. When booking your flight, simply enter your KTN into the designated field. This will allow you to bypass the standard security lines and move quickly through security screening. It is important to note that you must use the same KTN each time you travel in order for the program to work.
