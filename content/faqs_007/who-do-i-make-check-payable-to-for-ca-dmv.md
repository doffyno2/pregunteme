<p>When it comes to making a payment to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), you have a few different options. Depending on the type of payment you need to make and the amount, you may be able to pay with cash, check, money order, or credit/debit card. When it comes to making a payment with a check, who do you make it out to?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the type of payment you need to make. For most DMV payments, the check should be made out to the “California Department of Motor Vehicles.” This is true for registration fees, driver’s license fees, driver’s license renewal fees, commercial driver’s license fees, and any other fees related to DMV services. You may also see the check payable to “DMV.”</p>

<p>If you are making a payment for a vehicle bought from a dealership, the check should be made out to the dealership. The dealership will then forward the payment to the DMV. This ensures that the payment is properly credited to the vehicle’s registration and the DMV records are kept up to date. If you are paying for a vehicle bought from a private seller, the check should be made out to the DMV.</p>

<h2>What if I am Making a Payment for a Traffic Ticket?</h2>

<p>If you are making a payment for a traffic ticket, the check should be made out to the court that issued the ticket. You can find information about which court issued the ticket on the ticket itself. If you are paying for a traffic ticket online, you may be able to pay with a credit/debit card, PayPal, or another form of electronic payment. However, if you are required to pay by check, you should make it out to the court.</p>

<h2>What Information Should I Include on the Check?</h2>

<p>When writing a check to the DMV or a court, you should include the following information: your name, the address, and the amount of the payment. You should also include the reason for the payment. For example, if you are making a payment for a driver’s license renewal, you should include “Driver’s License Renewal” on the check. Finally, you may need to include your driver’s license number, vehicle registration number, or other identifying information, depending on the type of payment.</p>
