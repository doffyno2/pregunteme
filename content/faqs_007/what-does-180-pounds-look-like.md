<p>At first glance, it’s hard to tell how much a person weighs just by looking at them. After all, everyone’s body shape and size is unique, and weight can be deceptive. However, there is an average that you can use to get an idea of what 180 pounds looks like.</p>

<p>180 pounds is considered to be an average weight for an adult man. It's slightly above the average weight for an adult woman and is just over the healthy weight range for a person of this height. Depending on the person's body fat percentage, they may look very different from the average. Someone with a high body fat percentage may appear to be larger, while someone with a low body fat percentage may appear to be smaller.</p>

<p>But what does 180 pounds look like on an average person? Generally speaking, a person who weighs 180 pounds will be about 5’10” tall. They will likely have an average frame size and be medium-to-large boned. Their waist will measure approximately 37 inches and the chest will measure approximately 44-45 inches.</p>

<p>If you are looking to lose or gain weight, 180 pounds is a good starting point. It can be used as a reference for setting goals and measuring progress. It’s important to remember that everyone’s body is different, so what works for one person may not work for another.</p>
