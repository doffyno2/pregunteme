<p>Coyotes are a species of canine native to North America. These wild animals have long held an important place in the culture of many Native American tribes, who often used their howls and other sounds as a way to communicate with each other. The coyote is also known for its distinctive call, which is often heard in the night and has been described as a mix of a bark and a howl. So, what sound do coyotes make and what do their calls mean?</p>

<h2>What Does a Coyote Howl Sound Like?</h2>

<p>Coyotes have a range of calls, but their most distinctive sound is the howl. It is typically a long, drawn-out yapping sound that rises and falls in pitch. It can also be described as a yodel, as it often begins with a few short yips before transitioning into a long and loud howl. Some people compare it to the sound of a distant wolf, but it is much more high-pitched.</p>

<p>Coyotes often howl in the early evening and night, and the sound can carry for miles. It is believed that coyotes howl to communicate with each other and to establish their territories. They may also howl to attract mates, or to warn other coyotes to stay away.</p>

<h2>What Other Sounds Do Coyotes Make?</h2>

<p>In addition to their howls, coyotes also make a range of other vocalizations. They may bark, yip, wail, growl or whimper. These sounds can be used to indicate aggression or fear, and to communicate with each other. Coyotes may also make a series of short yips or barks when they are excited or to alert other coyotes to their presence.</p>

<p>Coyotes may also make a low-pitched, rumbling sound that is known as a “bark-howl.” This sound is thought to be used when a male coyote is trying to attract a mate, or to keep other coyotes away from its territory. It is usually followed by a series of short yips or barks.</p>
