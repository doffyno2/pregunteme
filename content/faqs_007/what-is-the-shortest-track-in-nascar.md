What is the Shortest Track in NASCAR?



NASCAR, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, is the most popular form of motorsports in the United States. It’s known for its high-speed racing on oval shaped tracks, and each track has its own length and characteristics. While some tracks are up to two miles long, the shortest track in NASCAR is Martinsville Speedway, located in Martinsville, Virginia. It’s the only track in NASCAR that measures less than one mile. 

<h2>History of Martinsville Speedway</h2>

Martinsville Speedway was constructed in 1947 by H. Clay Earles, who had previously owned a local dirt track. The track was built in the style of a flat, half-mile oval, with a half-mile long straightaway. Clay earles named the track after Martinsville, the small Virginia town that is located approximately 20 miles north of the speedway. 

The first NASCAR race at Martinsville was held on September 7, 1947. It was a 200-lap race on the dirt track, with Bill France Sr. taking the checkered flag. The track was paved over in 1955, and the first NASCAR Grand National race on a paved track was held on October 29th of that same year.
