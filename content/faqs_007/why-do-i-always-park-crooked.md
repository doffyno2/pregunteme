Millions of drivers have asked themselves this question - why do I always park crooked? It's a common problem that can be extremely frustrating, particularly when there's a line of cars waiting behind you. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to make sure you park straight.

<h2>What Causes Crooked Parking?</h2>

The most common cause of crooked parking is a lack of practice. Many drivers don't take the time to practice their parking skills, resulting in poor technique and alignment. This can be particularly problematic in tight spaces or areas with limited visibility. Other factors, such as the size of the parking spot, can also contribute to crooked parking. In some cases, drivers may simply be too hurried or distracted to properly align their car.

<h2>How Can I Park Straight?</h2>

The most important step to properly parking is to take your time. Before you begin, take a few moments to orient yourself and look for any obstacles. Make sure you have a good view of the lines marking the parking spot. When you are ready to begin, back your car into the spot slowly and steadily. Use the mirrors to help guide you and take your time. If you find yourself struggling to stay on track, consider using a guide such as a cone or a flag.

<h2>Tips for Better Parking</h2>

There are a few simple steps you can take to make sure you park straight every time. First, make sure you have a good view of the entire parking spot. Second, take your time and use your mirrors to guide you. Third, practice in an empty lot or an area with plenty of space. Finally, if you find yourself struggling, consider using a guide such as a cone or a flag.
