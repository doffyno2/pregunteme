Per stay is an accommodation term used to describe the cost of a hotel room or other type of lodging for a single night. It is typically used to refer to the rate charged by hotels and other lodging establishments for a single night's stay. The per stay rate can vary depending on the time of year, the type of room, and the amenities offered by the hotel or lodging establishment.

<h2>What is included in a per stay rate?</h2>

The per stay rate generally includes the cost of the room, taxes, and any other fees associated with the stay. This can include things like resort fees, pet fees, and parking fees. Some hotels may offer additional amenities such as breakfast or other amenities for an additional fee, but this is not typically included in the per stay rate. 

<h2>What factors determine per stay rates?</h2>

The per stay rate is typically determined by a variety of factors, including the time of year, the type of room, and the amenities offered by the hotel or lodging establishment. The time of year can be a major factor in determining the per stay rate, as hotels often charge higher rates during peak travel periods. Similarly, the type of room can also influence the per stay rate, with larger and more luxurious rooms typically costing more per night than smaller and simpler rooms. Finally, the amenities offered by the hotel or lodging establishment can also influence the per stay rate, with more luxurious hotels typically charging more for their amenities.

<h2>Are per stay rates negotiable?</h2>

In some cases, per stay rates may be negotiable. Hotels may be willing to lower the per stay rate if a customer is booking multiple nights at the same time, or if the customer is willing to pay for the full stay in advance. Some hotels may also offer discounts for customers who are members of loyalty programs, or who book their stay through certain online travel websites.

<h2>What are the benefits of per stay rates?</h2>

The primary benefit of per stay rates is that they are generally more affordable than other forms of accommodation. Per stay rates tend to be lower than long-term rental rates, and they provide customers with the flexibility to stay at a hotel or other lodging establishment for just one night, without having to commit to a long-term rental. Additionally, many hotels and lodging establishments offer discounts for customers who book multiple nights, which can make per stay rates even more affordable.
