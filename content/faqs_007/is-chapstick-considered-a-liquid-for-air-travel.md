<p>When it comes to air travel, many passengers are confused about what is and isn't considered a liquid for security purposes. This is especially true for items such as Chapstick, which may look like a liquid but is actually a solid. It's important to understand the security rules regarding liquids so that you don't run into any issues at the airport.</p>

<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a number of rules and regulations regarding the types of liquids that are allowed in carry-on luggage. Generally speaking, all liquids must be in containers that are 3.4 ounces or less and must be placed in a single, clear, quart-sized plastic bag. This bag must be able to close completely and must be placed in a bin for x-ray screening. However, there are some exceptions to these rules.</p>

<p>Chapstick is one of these exceptions. Since Chapstick is a solid, it does not need to be placed in a quart-sized bag. However, it should still be placed in a bin for x-ray screening. It is also important to note that Chapstick is considered a liquid for the purpose of the 3-1-1 rule. This means that if you have more than 3.4 ounces of Chapstick, you will need to place it in a checked bag.</p>
