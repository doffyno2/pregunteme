<p>When it comes to building a house, the cost of construction is one of the biggest factors to consider. In general, the cost of construction depends on the size and complexity of the structure. But what kind of house can you build for a budget of $100,000?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on a few factors, such as the type of house you want to build, the quality of materials you choose and the region you live in.

On the other hand, in some regions, the cost of labor is lower, which could make a big difference in the total cost of your project. </p>
