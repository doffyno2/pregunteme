<p>It can be a real frustration if no water comes out when you try to bleed a radiator. This can be due to a number of different reasons, so it's important to identify the issue and take the necessary steps to resolve it. In this article, we will discuss what to do if no water comes out when bleeding a radiator.</p>

<h2>Check The Radiator Is Filled Correctly</h2>

<p>The first thing to do when you discover no water is coming out when you try to bleed a radiator is to check that the radiator is filled correctly. If the radiator has not been filled up to the correct level, then it will be unable to push the air out of the system. You should check that the water level is at least two inches above the top of the radiator.</p>

<h2>Check The Bleed Valve Is Open</h2>

<p>The bleed valve should be open when you try to bleed a radiator. If the valve is not open, then no water will be able to come out. You should also check that the valve is not blocked by any debris or dirt. If the valve is blocked, then you should try to clear it before attempting to bleed the radiator.</p>

<h2>Check The Radiator Is Free Of Leaks</h2>

<p>It is important to check that the radiator is free of leaks before attempting to bleed it. If there is a leak in the system, then it could be preventing water from being pushed out of the system. You should check the radiator for signs of leaks, such as damp patches or water under the radiator.</p>

<h2>Check The Radiator Is Not Blocked</h2>

<p>If the radiator is blocked, then this could be preventing water from being pushed out. You should check for any blockages in the system, such as pieces of debris or dirt. If the radiator is blocked, then you should try to clear it before attempting to bleed it.</p>

<h2>Check The Pressure Is Correct</h2>

<p>The pressure of the system should also be checked when attempting to bleed a radiator. If the pressure is too low, then this could be preventing the water from being pushed out. You should check the pressure is at the correct level before attempting to bleed the radiator. If it is too low, then you should try to increase the pressure by adding more water to the system.</p>

<h2>Check The Radiator Valves Are Working Correctly</h2>

<p>The radiator valves should also be checked to ensure they are working correctly. If the valves are not working correctly, then this could be preventing water from being pushed out. You should check that the valves are open and not blocked before attempting to bleed the radiator.</p>

<h2>Check The Water Flow Is Not Restricted</h2>

<p>The water flow should also be checked to ensure it is not restricted. If the flow is restricted, then this could be preventing water from being pushed out. You should check that the pipes are not blocked or that there are no kinks in them before attempting to bleed the radiator.</p>

<h2>Hire A Plumber To Check The System</h2>

<p>If you have checked all of the above and no water is still coming out when you try to bleed the radiator, then you may need to hire a plumber to check the system. A plumber will be able to identify any issues with the system and take the necessary steps to resolve them.</p>
