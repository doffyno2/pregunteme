Taste buds are the small sensory organs found on the tongue that help us detect flavors. They are essential for our enjoyment of food and drinks, but, unfortunately, they can become damaged, leading to a decrease in taste sensation. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as changes in diet, excessive consumption of alcohol, smoking, and certain medications. Fortunately, there are things you can do to help repair damaged taste buds.
