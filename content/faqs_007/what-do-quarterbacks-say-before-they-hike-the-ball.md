<p>Quarterbacks are the most important position on the field in a football game. It is their job to lead the offense and make sure the play goes as planned.

After the play has been called, the quarterback will then give his teammates the signal to hike the ball.</p>

<p>Once the play has been called and the signal has been given, the quarterback will then give his teammates any last minute instructions. This could be anything from reminding the wide receivers to stay in their routes, to telling the running backs to stay in their lanes. The quarterback may also use hand signals, such as pointing to the spot he wants someone to go. Once the instructions have been given, the quarterback will then hike the ball.</p>
