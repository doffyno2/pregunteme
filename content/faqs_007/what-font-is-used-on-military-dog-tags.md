Military dog tags are an iconic symbol of service and patriotism for those in the United States Armed Forces. They serve a very practical purpose as well, providing a way to quickly and easily identify a service member in the event of their death or incapacitation. But what font is used on military dog tags?

<h2>History of Military Dog Tags</h2>

Military dog tags have been in use since at least the Civil War, when they were referred to as “identification discs” or “identity discs.” During World War I, the U.S. Army began issuing metal identification tags, which were referred to as “dog tags” due to their resemblance to the tags worn by pets.

Today, military dog tags are issued to all active duty service members and are generally made of stainless steel and are stamped with personal information such as name, Social Security number, blood type, religion, and more.

<h2>What Font is Used on Military Dog Tags?</h2>

The font used on military dog tags is a monospaced font known as “Gotham”. This font was specifically chosen for its ability to be easily read in any environment, including by trained personnel in the field. It is a sans-serif font, which means it does not contain any decorative or ornamental elements.

Gotham is a typeface designed by American type designer Tobias Frere-Jones in 2000. It was designed to be a modern, legible typeface that could be used for both text and display applications. Its letterforms have a relatively low x-height and are slightly condensed, which helps them to stand out in a crowd.

<h2>What Are Dog Tags Made Of?</h2>

Military dog tags are typically made of stainless steel, although other materials such as aluminum, plastic, and rubber are also used for certain applications. The metal tags are usually stamped with the necessary information and then attached to a chain or cord for wear.

<h2>How Are Dog Tags Attached?</h2>

Military dog tags are typically attached to a metal chain or cord. The chain or cord is then looped around the service member’s neck and the two tags are secured together with a metal clasp.
