<p>The double edged knife, also known as a dirk or dagger, is a type of knife with two sharpened edges running along the full length of the blade. It is considered to be one of the most dangerous weapons, due to its ability to inflict serious injury in a relatively small amount of time. In many countries, carrying a double edged knife is illegal.</p>

<p>The reasons for this ban vary, but the most common one is that double edged knives are classified as weapons, not tools.
