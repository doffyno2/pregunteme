<p>When it comes to the birthing process of canines, the water breaking is one of the most recognizable moments. Just like in humans, once the dog's water breaks, it is a sign that the puppies are about to be born. But what does this look like? What should you be on the lookout for? Here we will discuss what to expect when a pregnant dog's water breaks and what you should do if this occurs. </p>

<h2>What Does the Water Look Like?</h2>

<p>The water that is released when a pregnant dog's water breaks looks very similar to the amniotic fluid that is found in humans. It will be a thin, clear liquid that is usually odorless. The amount of fluid that is released will vary depending on the individual dog and their pregnancy. Some dogs will have a small trickle while others may release a large gush. It is important to note that the water breaking is not always the first sign of labor. Some dogs will show other signs of labor prior to their water breaking. </p>

<h2>When Does the Water Break?</h2>

<p>The water typically breaks when the dog is in active labor. This means that the contractions are occurring and the puppies are ready to be born. It is important to note that the water breaking does not always occur before the puppies are born. Some dogs may have their water break while they are in the process of delivering their puppies. This is why it is important to be ready in case the water breaking is the first sign of labor. </p>

<h2>What Should You Do If the Water Breaks?</h2>

<p>If you notice that the water has broken, it is important to call your veterinarian right away. They will be able to provide you with instructions on what to do and if they need to come out to the location. In some cases, they may advise you to bring the dog into their office. It is important to keep an eye on the dog and monitor her for signs of labor. If there are no signs of labor after the water has broken, you should contact your veterinarian right away. </p>

<h2>Can You Prevent the Water From Breaking?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent the water from breaking. This is a natural part of the birthing process and it is something that you will need to be prepared for. The best thing you can do is to make sure that you are aware of the signs of labor and be ready to provide the necessary care and attention for your pregnant dog. </p>
