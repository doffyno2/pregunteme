Starting a campfire in Ark is an important part of survival in the wilderness. Campfires provide warmth, light and a place to cook food. While camping in Ark, it is essential that you know how to start a campfire safely and efficiently. In this article, we will discuss how to start a campfire in Ark.

<h2>Gathering the Materials</h2>

The first step to starting a campfire in Ark is to gather the necessary materials. You will need three types of material: tinder, kindling and fuel. Tinder is the smallest and driest material that will ignite and can include paper, dry leaves, small twigs, and dry grass. Kindling is slightly larger than tinder and is used to feed the fire and keep it burning. Kindling can include wood shavings, small twigs, and sticks. Finally, fuel is the material that will last the longest and generate the most heat. Fuel can include logs and larger pieces of wood. 

<h2>Building the Fire</h2>

Once you have collected all of the necessary materials, it’s time to begin building the fire. Start by creating a teepee structure with some of the tinder in the center of the fire pit. Arrange the kindling around the tinder in a teepee shape, leaving enough space in the center for air to circulate. Place the fuel around the kindling. Make sure the fuel is not touching the tinder.

<h2>Lighting the Fire</h2>

Now it’s time to light the fire. There are several ways to light a campfire in Ark. You can use a match, a lighter, or even a magnifying glass. If you are using a match or lighter, make sure the flame is close to the tinder. Once the tinder is lit, the kindling will catch fire and the fire will begin to spread. 

<h2>Maintaining the Fire</h2>

Once the fire is lit, you will need to keep it burning. Make sure to add more fuel as needed. The size of the fire will depend on how much fuel you add. If the fire starts to die down, add more fuel to keep it going.

<h2>Extinguishing the Fire</h2>

When it’s time to extinguish the fire, make sure to do it safely. Start by pouring water on the fire, making sure to soak all of the embers. Once the fire is extinguished, spread the ashes and make sure there are no hot spots left.
