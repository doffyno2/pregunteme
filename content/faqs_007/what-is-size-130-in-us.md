Size 130 is a size measurement for clothing that is most commonly used in Europe. It is part of a system of sizes for clothing, footwear, and other items that is based on the height, weight, and girth (circumference) of the person wearing the item. Clothing sizes in the US are different than those in Europe, meaning that the same size in Europe may not be the same size in the US.

<h2>What is the Difference between European and US Clothing Sizes?</h2>

The main difference between clothing sizes in Europe and the US is that sizes in Europe are based on metric measurements while sizes in the US are based on imperial measurements.

In addition, European sizes tend to be smaller than US sizes, and sizes can vary between different countries in Europe. 

<h2>What is the Equivalent of a Size 130 in the US?</h2>

The equivalent of a size 130 in the US is typically a size 5 or 6. This is because US clothing sizes are based on measurements in inches, whereas European sizes are based on measurements in centimeters. To convert from centimeters to inches, one must multiply the number of centimeters by 0.3937. For example, a size 130 in Europe is typically around 130 centimeters, or 50.3937 inches.
