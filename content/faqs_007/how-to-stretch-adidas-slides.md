Adidas slides are a popular type of footwear that is designed to provide comfort and style. The shoes are designed with a sole that has a deep tread pattern, which provides good grip and traction on a variety of surfaces. However, like any other type of shoes, there are times when the shoes may need to be stretched to fit better. Luckily, there are a few simple steps that can be taken to easily stretch out Adidas slides.

<h2>Things You Will Need</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Adidas slides</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Freezer bags</li>
    <li>Hair dryer</li>
    <li>Towel</li>
    <li>Newspaper or shoe stretcher</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Fill the Freezer Bags with Water</h2>

Fill a few freezer bags with water and place them inside the shoes. Make sure the water is at room temperature, as cold water may cause damage to the shoes. Leave the bags in the shoes for a few hours, or overnight if necessary, to allow the leather to expand.

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Bags and Dry the Shoes</h2>

Remove the bags of water from the shoes and dry them with a towel. Place the shoes on a flat surface and use a hair dryer to dry the shoes. Move the hair dryer back and forth over the entire shoe, including the sole, to ensure that all parts of the shoe are dry.

<h2>Step 3: Use a Shoe Stretcher or Newspapers</h2>

Once the shoes are dry, use a shoe stretcher or newspapers to help stretch out the shoe. To use a shoe stretcher, simply insert the stretcher into the shoe and turn the knob to expand the shoe. To use newspapers, stuff the shoe with newspapers and leave it overnight. The newspaper will help stretch the shoe and make it more comfortable.

<h2>Step 4: Wear the Shoes Around the House</h2>

After stretching out the shoes with a shoe stretcher or newspapers, wear the shoes around the house to break them in. This will help the shoes fit better and make them more comfortable. Make sure to wear socks with the shoes to prevent any irritation.
