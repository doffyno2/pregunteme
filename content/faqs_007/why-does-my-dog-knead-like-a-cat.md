<p>Dog kneading, also known as “making biscuits,” is an instinctive behavior that canines display when they’re feeling relaxed, content, and secure. It’s most commonly seen when a pup is lying down and rubbing its paws back and forth on a blanket or your lap. While it’s an endearing behavior that many people just accept as part of their pup’s personality, many have wondered why they do it. It turns out that the answer may not be so different from why cats knead. </p>

<h2>What is Kneading?</h2>

<p>Kneading is a behavior that is seen in both cats and dogs. It is believed to be an instinctive behavior, passed down from the domestication of wild animals. In both cats and dogs, kneading is a sign of contentment and comfort. It is usually seen when the animal is being petted or lying down on a soft surface. The behavior involves the animal pushing its front paws in and out against the surface in a rhythmic motion. </p>

<h2>Why Do Cats Knead?</h2>

<p>Cats knead to mark their territory. The behavior is believed to be a remnant of their wildcat ancestor’s instinctive need to trample down tall grass and create a comfortable spot to rest.
