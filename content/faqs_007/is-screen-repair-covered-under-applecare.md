AppleCare is a support service provided by Apple Inc. for its products, which includes repair and replacement of defective or damaged parts. AppleCare covers many of the most common issues that can occur with Apple products, but does it cover screen repair?

<h2>What is AppleCare? </h2>

AppleCare is Apple's extended warranty service that provides additional coverage for Apple products. The AppleCare protection plan is designed to extend the coverage of the original one-year limited warranty and up to 90 days of complimentary telephone technical support. AppleCare coverage can be purchased for Apple products such as iPhones, iPads, Macs, iPods, Apple TV, and more. 

<h2>What Does AppleCare Cover? </h2>

AppleCare covers hardware repairs and service, including coverage for batteries, air conditioning, power supply, and more. AppleCare also covers software issues, such as OS updates and security risks. AppleCare doesn't cover accidental damage, such as a cracked screen, water damage, or other similar issues. 

<h2>Does AppleCare Cover Screen Repair? </h2>

Unfortunately, AppleCare does not cover screen repair for any of its products. Screen repair is considered an accidental damage issue, and as such is not covered by AppleCare. If your device has a cracked or damaged screen, you will need to pay for the repair out of pocket.

<h2>Can I Purchase Additional Coverage for Screen Repair? </h2>

Apple does not offer any additional coverage for accidental damage, including screen repair. However, you may be able to purchase additional coverage through a third-party provider. Many companies offer extended warranty plans that cover accidental damage, including screen repair. These plans typically cost more than AppleCare, but can provide valuable protection for your device. 

<h2>What If My Device is Not Covered by AppleCare? </h2>

If your device is not covered by AppleCare, you may still be able to get it repaired by an Apple-authorized service provider. Apple-authorized service providers are certified to repair Apple products, and may be able to repair your device even if it is not covered by AppleCare. 

<h2>What If I Need to Replace My Screen? </h2>

If you need to replace your screen, you will need to take your device to an Apple-authorized service provider. An Apple-authorized service provider can replace your screen with an original Apple part. This may cost more than a third-party replacement part, but it will ensure that your device is repaired correctly and with genuine Apple parts.
