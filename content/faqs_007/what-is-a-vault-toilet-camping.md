Vault toilet camping is a type of camping where you use a vault toilet as your primary source of bathroom facilities. Vault toilets are an alternative to traditional camping toilets, as they are self-contained and do not require any plumbing or installation. They provide a more hygienic and safe way to use the bathroom while camping.

<h2>What is a Vault Toilet?</h2> 

A vault toilet is a self-contained toilet that is designed to be used in the outdoors. It is made up of two parts: a base and a lid. The base is typically made of steel and has a tank that holds the waste. The lid is made of plastic or fiberglass and has a handle for opening and closing the lid. Vault toilets are also known as “porta-potties”. They are used in many places, including camping sites, parks, and public rest areas.

<h2>How Does a Vault Toilet Work?</h2>

A vault toilet is designed to be easy to use and self-contained. The base of the toilet has an opening in the top where the waste is placed. Waste is then stored in the tank, and when the tank is full, the lid is closed and the toilet is moved to a disposal area. The tank is then emptied and the toilet moved back to its original location.
