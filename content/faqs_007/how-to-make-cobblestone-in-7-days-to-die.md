<h2>What is Cobblestone?</h2>

Cobblestone is a type of rock made of small, rounded stones. It is often used in construction, such as for roadways and walkways. It is also used in landscaping and decoration. Cobblestone is made by collecting small stones and then grinding them down until they are all the same size.

<h2>Why Would You Want to Make Cobblestone?</h2>

There are many reasons why someone might want to make their own cobblestone. For one, it is much cheaper than buying pre-made cobblestone. It also allows you to customize the size and shape of the stones, as well as the color and texture. Additionally, making your own cobblestone gives you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

<h2>What Materials Do You Need to Make Cobblestone?</h2>

There are a few materials you will need to make cobblestone. The most important is a source of small stones. These can be found in rivers, creeks, and streams, or purchased from a quarry or other supplier. You will also need a large tub, a shovel, a sieve, and a hammer.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Cobblestone in 7 Days to Die</h2>

<h3>Day 1: Collect Stones</h3>

The first step in making cobblestone is to collect stones. Look for stones that are roughly the same size, as this will make the grinding process easier. Collect as many stones as you can, as you will need several buckets of stones to make enough cobblestone for a project.

<h3>Day 2: Sift Stones</h3>

Once you have collected the stones, it is time to sift them. Sifting stones is the process of sorting them based on size, shape, and texture. Place the stones in the sieve and shake it until the stones are sorted. Discard any stones that are too large or too small.

<h3>Day 3: Grind Stones</h3>

Now that the stones are sorted, it is time to grind them. Place the stones in the tub and use the hammer to grind them until they are all the same size. This process can be time consuming, so make sure you have plenty of time to dedicate to grinding the stones.

<h3>Day 4: Rinse Stones</h3>

Once you have finished grinding the stones, it is time to rinse them. Place the stones in a bucket of water and use the shovel to stir them around. This will help to remove any dirt or debris that may have been ground into the stones.

<h3>Day 5: Dry Stones</h3>

Once the stones have been rinsed, it is time to dry them. Spread the stones out on a tarp or other flat surface and allow them to dry in the sun. This can take several hours, so it is important to be patient and allow the stones to dry completely.

<h3>Day 6: Sort Stones</h3>

Once the stones have dried, it is time to sort them again. Place the stones back in the sieve and shake it until they are sorted. Discard any stones that are too large or too small.

<h3>Day 7: Assemble Cobblestone</h3>

The final step in making cobblestone is to assemble it. Place the stones in the desired pattern and use mortar to secure them together. Once the cobblestone is assembled, it is ready for use!
