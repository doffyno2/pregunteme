<p>If your MacBook Pro suddenly shuts down when the lid is closed, it can be a sign of a potential issue with your laptop. There are a few potential solutions to this issue, ranging from simple to more complex. In this article, we will discuss the most common causes for your MacBook Pro shutting down when the lid is closed and how to fix them.</p>

<h2>What Causes MacBook Pro Shutting Down When Lid Closed?</h2>

<p>The most common cause of your MacBook Pro shutting down when the lid is closed is a power management issue. This could be a result of a faulty power adapter, a corrupt operating system, or incorrect settings in the Energy Saver preferences. Other potential causes include a faulty logic board, a failing hard drive, or a faulty battery.</p>

<h2>How to Fix MacBook Pro Shutting Down When Lid Closed?</h2>

<p><b>Check Your Power Adapter:</b> The first step is to check your power adapter. If it’s not working properly, then it could be causing your laptop to shut down when the lid is closed. Try plugging the power adapter into a different outlet and see if that helps. If the issue persists, then it’s likely a faulty power adapter and you should replace it.</p>

<p><b>Check the Energy Saver Settings:</b> Another possible cause of your MacBook Pro shutting down when the lid is closed is incorrect Energy Saver settings. To check this, open System Preferences > Energy Saver and make sure that the “Put the display to sleep when the computer is inactive for” option is set to “Never” and that the “Put the computer to sleep when it is inactive for” option is set to “Never”.</p>

<p><b>Reset the System Management Controller (SMC):</b> The SMC is responsible for managing many of the hardware functions on your laptop. If the SMC has become corrupt, it could be causing your laptop to shut down when the lid is closed. To reset the SMC, you can follow the instructions in our guide <a href="link">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Check the Logic Board:</b> If the above steps don’t help, then it’s possible that the issue is being caused by a faulty logic board. Logic board problems can be hard to diagnose, so if you think this might be the cause of the issue then you should take your laptop to a certified technician for further diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Check the Hard Drive:</b> If your hard drive is failing, then it could be causing your laptop to shut down when the lid is closed. To check this, you can run a disk utility program to scan for errors. If the disk utility finds any errors, then you should replace the hard drive.</p>

<p><b>Replace the Battery:</b> If the above steps don’t help, then it’s possible that the issue is being caused by a faulty battery. If this is the case, then you should replace the battery with a new one. You can find instructions for replacing the battery in Apple’s online support guide.</p>
