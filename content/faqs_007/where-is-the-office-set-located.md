The Office is an American sitcom television series created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. The show follows the everyday lives of office employees, in the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is a branch of a fictional paper company called Dunder Mifflin Incorporated. The show was first aired on NBC in 2005 and later ended in 2013. 

The show was filmed in various locations in California, such as Los Angeles, Burbank, and Valencia. The show's producers were looking for a location to film the show in which they could find a great deal of offices and warehouses. After much searching, they decided on a location in Van Nuys, California, and it remains the main filming location for The Office.
