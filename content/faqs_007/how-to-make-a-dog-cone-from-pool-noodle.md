Dogs can get injured on occasion, and when this happens, their owners might need to purchase a cone for them to wear to prevent them from licking or scratching their wound. But why purchase an expensive cone for your pup when you can make one out of a pool noodle? In this article, we'll explain how to make a dog cone from a pool noodle in a few easy steps. 

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

Before you start making your dog cone, you'll need to gather the following materials: 

<ul>
<li>Pool Noodle</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Tape</li>
<li>Marker</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Cut the Pool Noodle</h2>

The first step is to cut the pool noodle into two pieces. Depending on the size of your dog, you'll need to determine how long the pieces should be. If you're not sure, you can measure your dog's neck and then add a few inches for extra comfort. Once you've determined the length, use the scissors to cut the noodle into two pieces. 

<h2>Step 2: Mark the Noodle</h2>

The next step is to mark the noodle. Using the marker, draw a line down the middle of each piece of the noodle. This will help you determine where to cut the holes for your dog's head and legs. 

<h2>Step 3: Cut the Holes</h2>

Now that you've marked the noodle, it's time to cut the holes. For the head hole, you'll need to measure the circumference of your dog's head and then add an inch or two for extra comfort. Then, use the scissors to cut the hole in the center of the noodle. For the leg holes, you'll need to measure the circumference of your dog's legs and then add an inch or two for extra comfort. Then, use the scissors to cut two additional holes in the noodle. 

<h2>Step 4: Secure the Holes</h2>

Once you've cut the holes, you'll need to secure them so that they don't expand. To do this, you can use tape to tape around the edges of the holes. This will help to keep the holes from getting bigger and will also provide extra comfort for your dog. 

<h2>Step 5: Put it On Your Dog</h2>

Finally, it's time to put the cone on your dog. To do this, you'll need to slide the noodle over your dog's head. Then, you'll need to thread their legs through the other two holes. Once your dog is wearing the cone, you can use the tape to secure it in place.
