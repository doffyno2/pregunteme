<p>Scratches on a porcelain toilet can be unsightly and make your bathroom look dingy and dirty. Fortunately, there are some easy steps you can take to repair the scratched porcelain and restore it to its former glory. In this guide, we’ll explain how to repair a scratched porcelain toilet in just a few simple steps. </p>

<h2>What Causes Porcelain Toilet Scratches?</h2>

<p>Porcelain is a relatively durable material, but it is still susceptible to scratches from cleaning tools, toilet brushes, and other objects. Scratches can also be caused by hard water deposits, which can be difficult to remove without the right tools and techniques. If a scratch is deep enough, it can even cause the porcelain to chip or crack.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed to Repair a Scratched Porcelain Toilet</h2>

<p>Before you begin repairing your scratched porcelain toilet, you’ll need to gather the right tools and materials. The following items are needed for this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Soft cloth or sponge</li>
  <li>Mild soap</li>
  <li>Non-abrasive cleaning pad or sponge</li>
  <li>Sandpaper</li>
  <li>Toilet bowl cleaner</li>
  <li>Porcelain touch-up paint</li>
  <li>Fine-grit sandpaper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Toilet</h2>

<p>Before you begin repairing the scratched porcelain, you’ll need to clean the toilet. Begin by removing any dirt and debris from the surface of the toilet. Then, use a non-abrasive cleaning pad or sponge and mild soap to scrub away any stubborn dirt or hard water deposits. Once you’ve finished cleaning, rinse the toilet with clean water and dry it with a soft cloth or towel.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Sand the Scratched Area</h2>

<p>Once the toilet is clean, you can begin sanding the scratched area. Start by using a medium-grit sandpaper to remove any hard water deposits that may have caused the scratch. Then, move to a finer-grit sandpaper to smooth out the surface of the porcelain. Make sure to sand the edges of the scratch as well, to ensure that the porcelain touch-up paint can adhere properly.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Apply Porcelain Touch-Up Paint</h2>

<p>Once the scratched area is sanded, you can now apply the porcelain touch-up paint. Begin by shaking the paint can to mix the paint. Then, apply the paint to the scratched area in a thin, even coat. Allow the paint to dry completely before moving on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Polish the Surface</h2>

<p>Once the paint is dry, you can begin polishing the surface. Use a soft cloth and a mild toilet bowl cleaner to polish the surface of the porcelain. This will help to ensure that the paint blends in with the surrounding porcelain and that the scratch is not visible.</p>
