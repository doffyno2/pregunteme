Having the right size tube inside your tire is essential for biking safety. If the tube is too small, it may not fit properly, leading to a flat tire. If it's too large, you may have an issue with the tire slipping off the rim. So, understanding what size tube fits a 700x35c tire is important for any cyclist.

<h2>What is a 700x35c Tire?</h2>

A 700x35c tire is a standard type of road bike tire. The 700 refers to the size of the wheel rim, which is 700mm in diameter. The 35c indicates the width of the tire, which is 35mm. This type of tire is a mid-width tire, meaning it's suitable for a variety of surfaces. It's a good option for those who want a tire that is fast and comfortable.

<h2>What Size Tube Fits a 700x35c Tire?</h2>

The most important factor in determining what size tube fits a 700x35c tire is the size of the valve stem. The valve stem is the part of the tube that fits through the hole in the wheel rim. If the valve stem is too small, it won't fit through the hole and the tube won't fit. If the valve stem is too large, it won't seal properly and air will leak out. 

Most 700x35c tires use a Presta valve stem, which is a metal valve that is usually 6mm in diameter. However, some tires may use a Schrader valve stem, which is a plastic valve that is usually 8mm in diameter. 

The size of the tube itself is not as important as the size of the valve stem. The tube should be large enough to fill the tire, but not so large that it puts too much pressure on the side walls. A standard 700x35c tube should be between 28mm and 33mm wide.

<h2>How Can I Tell What Size Tube Fits My Tire?</h2>

The best way to determine what size tube fits your tire is to check the sidewall of the tire. The sidewall should have a number that indicates the size of the valve stem and the size of the tube. For example, if you see 700x35c/6-28-33, it means the tire has a Presta valve stem that is 6mm in diameter and the tube should be between 28mm and 33mm wide. 

If you don't see any numbers on the sidewall, you can usually figure out the size of the tube by measuring the width of the tire. Most 700x35c tires are between 28mm and 33mm wide.

<h2>What Are The Benefits of a 700x35c Tire?</h2>

A 700x35c tire is a great choice for road bikes. It's a mid-width tire that is fast and comfortable, making it suitable for a variety of surfaces. The 700x35c tire size also has good traction, making it suitable for a variety of conditions. 

Additionally, the 700x35c tire size is compatible with many types of rims, making it a good choice for those looking to upgrade their wheels. 

<h2>What Are The Disadvantages of a 700x35c Tire?</h2>

The main disadvantage of a 700x35c tire is that it is not suitable for very rugged terrain. If you plan to ride in mud, sand, or other off-road conditions, you should consider using a wider tire. Additionally, the 700x35c tire size may not provide the best traction on very wet roads.
