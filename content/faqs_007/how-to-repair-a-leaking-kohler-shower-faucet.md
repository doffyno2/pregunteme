<p>Kohler shower faucets are designed to provide a lifetime of reliable performance. However, even the most well-made faucets can develop problems over time. One of the most common problems is a leaking shower faucet. Luckily, repairing a leaking Kohler shower faucet is relatively easy and can be accomplished with a few simple tools. This article will explain the steps necessary to repair a leaking Kohler shower faucet.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Identify the Type of Faucet</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a leaking Kohler shower faucet is to identify the type of faucet. There are two main types of Kohler faucets: single-handle and two-handle. Single-handle faucets have a single lever that controls both the hot and cold water. Two-handle faucets have two separate levers, one for the hot water and one for the cold water.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Shut Off the Water</h2>

<p>Before attempting to repair a leaking Kohler shower faucet, it is important to shut off the water supply to the faucet. This can be accomplished by turning off the water shutoff valves located under the sink. If the shutoff valves are not easily accessible, the main water supply to the house should be shut off.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Remove the Handle</h2>

<p>Once the water supply is shut off, the handle of the faucet needs to be removed. This can be done by using a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the handle in place. Once the screws are removed, the handle can be carefully pulled off.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Remove and Replace the Cartridge</h2>

<p>The next step is to remove the cartridge from the faucet. The cartridge is the part that controls the flow of water. It is located inside the faucet body. To remove the cartridge, the retaining clip must be removed. This can be done with a pair of needle-nose pliers. Once the clip is removed, the cartridge can be carefully pulled out of the faucet body.</p>

<p>Once the cartridge is removed, it should be inspected for any damage or wear. If the cartridge is damaged or worn, it should be replaced with a new one. Installing a new cartridge is a straightforward process. The new cartridge should be inserted into the faucet body, and the retaining clip should be replaced. Once the cartridge is in place, it should be tested to ensure it is functioning properly.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Reassemble the Faucet</h2>

<p>The final step in repairing a leaking Kohler shower faucet is to reassemble the faucet. This can be done by reversing the steps taken to disassemble the faucet. The handle should be replaced, and the screws should be tightened. Once the handle is in place, the water supply should be turned back on and the faucet should be tested for leaks.</p>
