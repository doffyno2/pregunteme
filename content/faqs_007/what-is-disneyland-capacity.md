Disneyland is a world-famous theme park located in Anaheim, California, USA. It opened its gates to the public in 1955 and has been entertaining millions of visitors ever since. The park is divided into eight distinct areas, each of which offers a unique experience and atmosphere. Disneyland is home to some of the most popular attractions, shows, and rides in the world, making it a must-visit destination for any family or group of friends.

<h2>Park Capacity</h2>

Disneyland is the second-most visited theme park in the world, after the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida. On its busiest days, it can attract more than 90,000 visitors. As of 2021, the park's maximum capacity is 85,000 guests. This means that on days when the park is operating at full capacity, there could be as many as 85,000 people in the park at any one time.

<h2>How Is Capacity Limited?</h2>

Disneyland has several methods of controlling the amount of guests in the park at any given time. The most common way is to limit the number of tickets sold each day. For example, if only 50,000 tickets are sold, that is the maximum number of guests that can be in the park at once.

Disneyland also uses crowd control measures such as limiting the number of people in certain areas at any given time, for example, in queues for rides. Additionally, some attractions may have a limited capacity, so the number of people admitted to them per hour will be restricted. This means that even if the park is not at full capacity, certain attractions may not be able to accept any more guests.

<h2>What Happens When Capacity Is Reached?</h2>

When Disneyland's capacity is reached, guests will be informed and no more tickets will be available for purchase for that day. However, if you already have a ticket for the day you will still be able to enter the park and enjoy the attractions. Guests will be informed that the park is at capacity and that there may be long wait times for certain attractions.

<h2>What Are The Benefits Of Limiting Capacity?</h2>

Limiting the number of guests in Disneyland has several benefits. Firstly, it helps to make sure that the park remains safe and enjoyable for everyone. With 85,000 people in the park, it would be difficult to maintain order and keep everyone safe. Secondly, limiting the number of guests helps to ensure that everyone can enjoy the attractions without having to wait too long. If the park is overcrowded, wait times for rides and attractions can be much longer than usual.
