Softball is an increasingly popular sport among young kids. It is a great way to introduce them to the world of team sports and the joy of competition. But it can be difficult to know what size softball to buy for a 7 year old. The wrong size ball can be difficult to play with and could potentially lead to injuries. In this article, we'll discuss the different sizes of softballs and the best size for a 7 year old. 

<h2>Softball Sizes</h2>

Softballs come in a variety of sizes. The most common sizes are 12 inch, 11 inch, and 10 inch. The 12 inch softball is the largest and most commonly used size. It is suitable for all ages and is the size used in professional softball leagues. The 11 inch softball is popular for younger players, as it is easier to grip and throw. The 10 inch softball is usually reserved for the smallest players, as it is much lighter and easier to control.
