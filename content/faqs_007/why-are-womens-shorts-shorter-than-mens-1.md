<h2>The Cultural Factor</h2>

<p>The first factor that affects women's shorts length is cultural. In some societies, it is seen as inappropriate for women to wear clothing that is too revealing, or that shows too much of their body. Women who want to adhere to these cultural norms often opt for shorts that are shorter than those worn by men.</p>
