<h2>What Are Awning Windows?</h2>

Awning windows are a type of window that opens outward from the bottom, allowing air to flow into a space while keeping the elements out. They are often found in bedrooms and bathrooms, and are a popular choice for modern homes. Awning windows are relatively easy to install, but they can occasionally run into problems due to wear and tear or improper installation.

<h2>Common Issues With Awning Windows</h2>

Awning windows can occasionally experience difficulty closing or staying closed. This is usually caused by problems with the window's sash or its hardware. 

The sash is the part of the window that moves. It is typically made from aluminum or vinyl and can become warped over time due to temperature changes or a buildup of dirt and debris. Warped sashes can prevent the window from closing properly.

The hardware on awning windows can also cause problems. The hardware includes the hinges, locks, and handles that allow the window to open and close. These components can become loose or worn out due to age or overuse, making it difficult to open and close the window.

<h2>Diagnosing Awning Windows That Won't Close</h2>

The first step in diagnosing awning windows that won't close properly is to inspect the sash. To do this, open the window and look for any visible damage or warping. If the sash appears to be bent or warped, it may need to be replaced.

Next, check the hardware on the window. Make sure that all the hinges, locks, and handles are properly secured and functioning. If any of the components are loose or broken, they will need to be replaced.

Finally, check the window frame for any damage. If the frame is cracked or warped, it could be preventing the window from closing properly.
