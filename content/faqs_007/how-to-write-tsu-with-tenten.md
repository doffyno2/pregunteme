<p>The Japanese writing system is complex and can be intimidating to those just learning how to read and write. The two main styles of writing are hiragana and katakana, with the former being used for native Japanese words, and the latter for foreign words and foreign names. In addition to these two main styles, the system also includes kanji, which are Chinese characters. One of the most difficult aspects of learning how to write in Japanese is knowing how to properly use the katakana characters, which are used to write foreign words and names. In this article, we will discuss a very basic writing technique: how to write 'tsu' with the katakana character 'tenten'. </p>

<h2>What is the Katakana Character 'Tenten'?</h2>

<p>The katakana character 'tenten' (テンテン) is a combination of two characters: 'te' (テ) and 'n' (ン). It is used to represent the sound 'tsu' (つ) in Japanese. It is one of the few katakana characters that has two parts, and it is one of the most difficult characters to learn how to write properly. </p>

<h2>How to Write 'Tenten'</h2>

<p>Writing 'tenten' correctly is not as easy as it may seem. It involves combining two characters, 'te' and 'n', into one, which can be tricky. Here are some tips on how to write 'tenten': </p>

<h3>Tip 1: Use the Right Pencil Grip</h3>

<p>The first step to writing 'tenten' correctly is to make sure you have the right pencil grip. You should hold the pencil between your thumb and index finger, with the point of the pencil facing away from you. Your other fingers should be slightly curled and not touching the paper. This grip will help you make accurate strokes when writing 'tenten'. </p>

<h3>Tip 2: Start with the 'Te' Character</h3>

<p>Once you have the right pencil grip, the next step is to start writing the 'te' character. Start by drawing a vertical line, and then draw a horizontal line right below it. Make sure the lines are straight, and that they are the same length. </p>

<h3>Tip 3: Add the 'N' Character</h3>

<p>Once you have drawn the 'te' character, the next step is to add the 'n' character. Start by drawing a vertical line below the 'te' character. Then draw a curved line that connects the two vertical lines. Make sure the lines are the same length and that the curves are smooth. </p>

<h3>Tip 4: Write the Character Slowly</h3>

<p>Finally, once you have drawn the 'te' and 'n' characters, the last step is to write the 'tenten' character slowly. Make sure that you keep your pencil grip steady and that your strokes are smooth and consistent. Take your time and make sure that the character looks neat and tidy. </p>
