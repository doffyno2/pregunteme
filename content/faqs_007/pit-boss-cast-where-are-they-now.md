Pit Boss was a hit reality television show that ran for five seasons from 2009 to 2012. It followed the daily lives of Shorty Rossi and his team of miniature horses and dogs that he and his team rescues from animal shelters. The show was beloved by fans who enjoyed watching the team's rescue efforts, as well as the drama that unfolded between Rossi, his assistant, and the other cast members.

Pit Boss made a huge impact on the animal rescue and reality TV communities, and fans were devastated when the show was canceled.
