Many shapes can have square corners, although the most common shapes are squares, rectangles, and rhombuses. Squares have four equal sides and four 90-degree angles, and are sometimes referred to as regular polygons. Rectangles are also four-sided shapes, but with two pairs of unequal sides and four 90-degree angles. Rhombuses are four-sided shapes with all sides equal, but their angles are not necessarily 90-degrees. In this article, we'll explore these shapes and many other shapes with square corners.

<h2>Squares</h2>

Squares are four-sided shapes with four equal sides and four 90-degree angles. A square is a regular polygon, which means that all sides and all angles are equal. Squares are commonly used in architecture, design, and engineering.

<h2>Rectangles</h2>

Rectangles have four sides, but all sides are not equal. The angles are all 90-degrees, but they are not necessarily equal in size. Rectangles are commonly used in construction, art, and graphic design.

<h2>Rhombuses</h2>

Rhombuses are four-sided shapes with all sides equal, but their angles are not necessarily 90-degrees. Rhombuses are often used in tile flooring, mosaics, and quilting.

<h2>Other Shapes With Square Corners</h2>

There are many other shapes that have square corners, including trapezoids, kites, and parallelograms. Trapezoids have four sides, two of which are parallel and two of which are not. Kites have four sides and two sets of adjacent equal angles, but the sides are not necessarily equal. Parallelograms have four sides and four 90-degree angles, but the sides and angles are not necessarily equal.

<h2>Uses of Shapes With Square Corners</h2>

Shapes with square corners are commonly used in many different fields. In architecture, they are often used in floor plans, furniture design, and window and door frames. In art, they are used for mosaics, quilting, and framing. In graphic design, they are often used to create logos, icons, and other visuals. In engineering, they are used for structural designs, such as bridges and buildings.

<h2>How to Draw Shapes With Square Corners</h2>

Drawing shapes with square corners is relatively easy. To begin, draw a line and then draw four equal lines perpendicular to the first line. These lines will form the four sides of the shape. Next, draw a line connecting the endpoints of each side to form the angles. Finally, adjust the angles to make sure they are all 90-degrees.
