Ariel the mermaid famously calls a fork a "dinglehopper" in the Disney movie The Little Mermaid. This scene has gone down in pop culture history as one of the most iconic and beloved moments from the movie. But why does Ariel call a fork a dinglehopper?

<h2>The Origins of the Word "Dinglehopper"</h2>

The origin of the word "dinglehopper" is not known, though it is speculated that it may be derived from an old English term meaning "a tool used to comb or groom hair".

The fact that Ariel is able to laugh at her own ignorance makes the scene even more endearing.
