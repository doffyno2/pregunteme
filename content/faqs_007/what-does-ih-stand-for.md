IH is an acronym for International Harvester, a company that was founded in 1902 in the United States. The company was the result of the merging of several different agricultural equipment companies. After the company's founding, it quickly became the largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment in the world and was a leading force in the industrialization of the farming industry.

<h2>The History of International Harvester</h2>

International Harvester was founded by Cyrus McCormick, who patented the mechanical reaper in 1831. This invention revolutionized the farming industry and allowed farmers to harvest larger amounts of grain in a shorter period of time. The company continued to innovate and expand, introducing a variety of new products over the years. In 1902, the company was officially named International Harvester and began producing a variety of tractors, harvesters, and other agricultural equipment. 

<h2>International Harvester during the 20th Century</h2>

Throughout the 20th century, International Harvester continued to be a leader in the agricultural industry. The company expanded its product line to include construction equipment, trucks, and other vehicles. It also produced a number of consumer products, such as refrigerators, stoves, and washing machines. By the 1950s, International Harvester was the largest agricultural equipment manufacturer in the world, with a presence in more than 140 countries. 

<h2>The Decline of International Harvester</h2>

In the 1970s and 1980s, International Harvester faced increased competition from foreign manufacturers, and the company began to struggle financially. In 1984, the company was sold to Tenneco, Inc. and the majority of its assets were sold off. The remaining assets were spun off as a new company, Navistar International. In the years since, Navistar has continued to produce agricultural and commercial equipment, but it no longer goes by the International Harvester name. 

<h2>The Legacy of International Harvester</h2>

International Harvester is largely remembered for its impact on the agricultural industry. The company's products allowed farmers to produce more crops in a shorter period of time and revolutionized the way that farming was done in the United States. Its products are still in use today and the company's legacy lives on in the products of its successor, Navistar International.
