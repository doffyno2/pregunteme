Transition lenses are one of the most popular types of eyeglasses available today. They are designed to automatically adjust the darkness of the lenses in response to the amount of light they are exposed to. This makes them ideal for activities such as driving, as they can reduce glare and provide comfortable vision in many different lighting conditions. However, due to their reliance on light, they can be difficult to test without the presence of sunlight. Fortunately, there are several ways to test transition lenses without sun.

<h2>Testing Transition Lenses at Home</h2>

The most common way to test transition lenses without sun is to use a home light box. A light box is simply a box with a lightbulb inside that is designed to simulate the environment of a sunny day. These boxes can be purchased online or in most home improvement stores. To use the light box, you will need to turn on the light and place the transition lenses inside. The lenses will then darken in response to the light, allowing you to determine how dark they get and how quickly they respond.

<h2>Testing Transition Lenses in a Store</h2>

If you are buying transition lenses from a store, it is likely that the store will have a machine designed to test transition lenses. These machines work similarly to the home light box, but they are designed to be more precise and accurate. The store will use the machine to test the lenses and determine how dark they get and how quickly they respond.

<h2>Testing Transition Lenses in Natural Sunlight</h2>

The most accurate way to test transition lenses is to do so in natural sunlight. To do this, you will need to go outside and place the lenses in direct sunlight. The lenses will then darken as they would in any other situation, allowing you to determine how dark they get and how quickly they respond.
