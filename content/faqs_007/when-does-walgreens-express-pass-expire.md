<p>Walgreens Express Pass is an exclusive membership program that allows customers to take advantage of a variety of benefits and discounts. The program helps customers save money on everyday purchases and allows them to receive special discounts and offers. As an Express Pass member, you get access to exclusive deals, free shipping, and other perks.</p>

<p>However, there is one important thing to keep in mind. All Walgreens Express Pass memberships have an expiration date.
