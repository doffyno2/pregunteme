<p>It's a question that many women have asked themselves when they first start experiencing the odor of their period blood. It's normal to be concerned and even a bit embarrassed, but there are a few different reasons why your period blood might smell like dog poop. Read on to learn more about what could be causing the smell and how to fix it.</p>

<h2>What Causes the Smell of Period Blood?</h2>

<p>The smell of your period blood is caused by a combination of vaginal secretions and the bacteria that live in your vagina. When your body has too much of certain bacteria, it can create an unpleasant odor. These bacteria can mix with your menstrual fluid, which can lead to a foul-smelling discharge.</p>

<p>The smell could also be caused by an infection. Bacterial vaginosis is a common infection that can lead to a fishy smell. Yeast infections can also cause a foul odor. If you have either of these infections, you should see your doctor for treatment.</p>

<h2>How to Control the Smell of Period Blood</h2>

<p>The best way to control the smell of your period blood is to practice good hygiene. Wearing breathable, cotton underwear and changing it regularly can help reduce the smell. You should also make sure to change your menstrual product every four to six hours to prevent odor-causing bacteria from building up.</p>

<p>Using a mild, unscented soap to clean your vulva twice a day can help eliminate bacteria and reduce the smell of your period blood. Some women find that adding a few drops of tea tree oil to their wash helps reduce odor. You should also avoid using harsh soaps, douches, or scented wipes, as these can irritate the vagina and increase the smell.</p>

<h2>Other Tips to Reduce the Smell of Period Blood</h2>
