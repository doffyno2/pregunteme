<h2>What Is In Energy Drinks? </h2>

<p>Energy drinks are beverages that contain a variety of ingredients in order to give the drinker an energy boost.

<p>Caffeine is the main ingredient in many energy drinks and is responsible for providing the energy boost. Caffeine is a stimulant that has been proven to help improve alertness and concentration. Taurine is an amino acid that helps to improve physical performance. Guarana is a plant extract that is used to provide energy and mental clarity. Ginseng is an herb that can help to improve the bodyâ€™s reaction to stress and reduce fatigue. B-vitamins act as energy boosters and help to increase energy levels. </p>
