What is Super Smoke on Traeger?


Traeger grills have become increasingly popular over the past decade, and with good reason. They offer an amazing grilling experience, with precise temperature control and innovative technology. One of the most impressive features of Traeger grills is the Super Smoke mode, which allows you to get the full flavor experience of smoking without the hassle of managing a smoking device. In this article, we’ll take a look at what Super Smoke is, how it works, and how it can enhance your grilling experience.

<h2>What is Super Smoke?</h2>

Super Smoke is an innovative feature of Traeger grills that allows you to smoke food without the hassle of managing a smoking device. The grills use a patented process to produce a cool smoke that infuses your food with a smoky flavor. The smoke is produced by burning pellets in a special tray, which is then circulated through the grill. This allows you to get that classic smoky flavor without having to manage a smoking device.

<h2>How Does Super Smoke Work?</h2>

The Super Smoke process is relatively simple. First, you fill the pellet tray with your choice of pellets. These are usually made of hardwood, such as cherry, mesquite, or hickory. Once the tray is filled, the grill is set to the “Super Smoke” setting. This setting activates the process of burning the pellets, which produces a cool smoke that is circulated through the grill. As the smoke passes through, it infuses your food with a smoky flavor.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Super Smoke?</h2>

The Super Smoke feature offers a number of benefits over traditional smoking methods. First, it is much easier to use than a smoking device, as you don’t have to constantly monitor the temperature or add more wood chips. Second, it produces a cool smoke that infuses your food with a rich, smoky flavor without the risk of overcooking or burning your food. Finally, it is a great way to add flavor to your food without adding any additional fat or calories.

<h2>How to Use Super Smoke?</h2>

Using the Super Smoke feature on your Traeger grill is easy. First, make sure you have the correct pellets, such as cherry, mesquite, or hickory. Then, fill the pellet tray with your chosen pellets and set the grill to the “Super Smoke” setting. You can adjust the temperature and the duration of the smoke to get the flavor you desire. Once the smoke has finished, your food is ready to be enjoyed!

<h2>Can I Use Super Smoke on Other Grills?</h2>

Unfortunately, the Super Smoke feature is only available on Traeger grills. Other grills may offer a similar feature, but it won’t be as precise or effective as the Super Smoke feature on Traeger grills.
