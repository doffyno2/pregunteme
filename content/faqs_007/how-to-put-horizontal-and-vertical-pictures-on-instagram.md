<p>Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, with more than one billion users. Instagram allows users to share photos and videos with their followers, but the platform has some specific rules when it comes to photo orientation. In this article, we will discuss how to put horizontal and vertical pictures on Instagram.</p>

<h2>Why You Need to Know How to Put Horizontal and Vertical Pictures on Instagram</h2>

<p>Instagram is unique in that it can only display photos and videos in a square format. This means that if you upload a horizontal or vertical photo, it will be cropped and might not appear the way you intended. To ensure that your photos look their best on Instagram, you need to know how to put horizontal and vertical pictures on Instagram.</p>
