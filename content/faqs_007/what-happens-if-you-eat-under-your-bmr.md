<p>Eating under your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) can be dangerous and can have serious health consequences. If you are not eating enough calories, then your body does not get the energy it needs to function properly. This can lead to fatigue, muscle loss, and a weakened immune system. In the long-term, this can lead to serious health complications, so it is important to understand the risks and make sure you are getting enough calories each day.</p>

<h2>What is BMR?</h2>

<p>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of energy your body needs to perform basic functions such as breathing, circulation, and digestion. It is measured by the number of calories you need each day to maintain your weight. Generally, the higher your body mass index (BMI), the higher your BMR, as more energy is needed to move a larger body. The BMR can be calculated using a formula that takes into account your height, weight, age, and sex.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risks of Eating Under Your BMR?</h2>

<p>The primary risk of eating under your BMR is malnutrition. When your body does not get enough calories, it is unable to perform all of its necessary functions. This can lead to fatigue, muscle loss, and a weakened immune system. In the long-term, it can even lead to serious health complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of infection.</p>

<p>In addition to health risks, eating under your BMR can also lead to unhealthy weight-loss tactics. When you are not getting enough calories, your body is forced to turn to its own energy stores for fuel. This can lead to unhealthy behaviors such as fasting, skipping meals, or eating very little. These tactics can be dangerous and can ultimately lead to further health complications.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do If You Are Eating Under Your BMR?</h2>

<p>If you think you may be eating under your BMR, it is important to speak to a doctor or nutritionist. They can provide you with guidance and advice on the best way to ensure you are getting the right amount of calories. They can also help you to identify any underlying health conditions that may be contributing to your low calorie intake.</p>

<p>It is also important to make sure you are eating a balanced, nutritious diet. Eating a variety of healthy foods will ensure you are getting all the essential vitamins and minerals your body needs. Additionally, focusing on nutrient-dense foods such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help you get the most out of your calorie intake.</p>

<h2>What Are Some Tips for Eating the Right Amount?</h2>

<p>If you are concerned about eating under your BMR, there are a few tips you can follow to make sure you are getting the right amount of calories each day. First, make sure you are eating breakfast every day. Breakfast is an important part of getting the energy you need for the day and can help you avoid overeating later on. Additionally, it is important to eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to ensure your body is getting the energy it needs.</p>

<p>Another important tip is to focus on portion control. It is important to eat enough, but not too much. To do this, try using smaller plates and measuring out your portions. Additionally, it is important to pay attention to how you feel after eating. If you feel full and satisfied, then you have probably eaten enough.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to make sure you are getting enough rest. Getting enough sleep helps your body recharge and get the energy it needs for the next day. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to make sure you are getting the rest you need.</p>
