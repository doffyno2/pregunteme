<p>The Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and Eastern Standard Time (EST) are two time zones that are used to keep track of time in the Eastern United States. EDT is the time zone used during the summer months, while EST is the time zone used during the winter months. Both time zones are based on the same Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset, which is UTC-4.</p>

<p>The difference between EDT and EST is that EDT is one hour ahead of EST during the summer months. So, when it’s 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST), it’s 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). This time difference is due to the fact that Daylight Saving Time (DST) is in effect during the summer months.</p>

<p>When Daylight Saving Time (DST) starts in the spring, the clocks are set ahead one hour, from EST to EDT. This means that when it is 8:00 AM EST, it is 9:00 AM EDT. When Daylight Saving Time (DST) ends in the fall, the clocks are set back one hour, from EDT to EST. This means that when it is 9:00 AM EDT, it is 8:00 AM EST.</p>

<p>In the United States, Daylight Saving Time (DST) begins at 2:00 AM on the second Sunday in March and ends at 2:00 AM on the first Sunday in November. This means that EDT is in effect from the second Sunday in March until the first Sunday in November. The exact dates for Daylight Saving Time (DST) vary from year to year, so it is important to check the exact dates for your area.</p>
