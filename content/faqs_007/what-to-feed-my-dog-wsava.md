Providing your dog with a balanced diet is essential for their long-term health and wellbeing. With so many pet food options available, it can be difficult to know what to feed your dog. According to the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA), there are certain guidelines that should be followed when it comes to feeding your pet. In this article, we will discuss what to feed your dog according to the WSAVA guidelines. 

<h2>What is the WSAVA?</h2>

The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) is an international organization that focuses on advancing the health and welfare of companion animals globally. The WSAVA has developed a set of guidelines and standards for the care and feeding of companion animals such as cats and dogs. These guidelines are based on the latest scientific evidence and are updated regularly as new information becomes available. 

<h2>WSAVA Guidelines for Dog Feeding</h2>

The WSAVA guidelines for dog feeding are as follows: 

<h3>Balanced Diet</h3>

The WSAVA recommends feeding your dog a balanced diet that includes a variety of different foods. This includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The diet should be rich in essential vitamins and minerals and contain adequate levels of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. 

<h3>Appropriate Amounts</h3>

The WSAVA also recommends feeding your dog the appropriate amount of food based on their age, size, and activity level. Puppies and young dogs need more food than older dogs. Dogs that are more active or participate in strenuous activity will need more calories than less active dogs. 

<h3>Avoid High-Fat Foods</h3>

High-fat foods should be avoided as they can lead to obesity, diabetes, and other health issues. Foods that are high in fat include processed foods, fried foods, and high-fat meats. 

<h3>Provide Access to Fresh Water</h3>

It is important to provide your dog with access to fresh, clean water at all times. This will help prevent dehydration and ensure your dog is getting the water they need.

It is important to take your dog for regular checkups with a veterinarian. This will help ensure that your dog is getting the right nutrition and that any health issues are identified and addressed early.
