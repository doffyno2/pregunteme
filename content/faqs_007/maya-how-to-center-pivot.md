<p>Centering objects in 3D space is a common task in Maya that involves setting the pivot point of an object to its exact center. This is useful for creating objects that are perfectly symmetrical, and for aligning objects with other objects in your scene. In this tutorial, we’ll go over the different ways to center pivot in Maya, so you can quickly and accurately center objects in your scenes.</p>

<h2>Using the Pivot Manipulator Tool</h2>

<p>The Pivot Manipulator tool is the quickest and most accurate way to center the pivot point of an object in Maya. To access this tool, first select the object you want to center, then go to the Tool Box, located in the lower right side of the interface. In the Tool Box, select the Pivot Manipulator tool, then click and drag the center point of the manipulator to the center of the object. The object’s pivot will now be perfectly centered.</p>

<h2>Using the Move Tool</h2>

<p>Another way to center the pivot point of an object is to use the Move Tool. First, select the object you want to center, then go to the Tool Box, located in the lower right side of the interface. In the Tool Box, select the Move Tool, then click and drag the center point of the manipulator to the center of the object. The object’s pivot will now be perfectly centered.</p>

<h2>Using the Translate Tool</h2>

<p>The Translate Tool can also be used to center the pivot point of an object. First, select the object you want to center, then go to the Tool Box, located in the lower right side of the interface.
