Fortunately, there are several ways to shrink a flannel shirt so that it fits better. Keep reading to learn how to shrink a flannel shirt.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Hot Water Wash and Dry</h2>

<p>One of the most effective methods for shrinking a flannel shirt is to use a hot water wash and dry cycle. Start by selecting the hottest temperature setting on your washing machine. Fill the washer with hot water, and add a small amount of detergent. Place the flannel shirt in the washer and let it soak for 10-15 minutes.</p>

<p>After soaking, turn the washer on and allow the shirt to agitate for a few minutes. When the agitation cycle is complete, drain the washer and transfer the shirt to the dryer.

<p>Another method of shrinking a flannel shirt is to use a hot iron. Start by setting the iron to the hottest temperature setting. Place the shirt on an ironing board and press the iron firmly against the fabric. Start with the back of the shirt, and work your way around to the front. Be sure to press firmly and evenly, as this will help shrink the shirt evenly.</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished pressing the shirt, let it cool completely. Then, try the shirt on and check for fit. This method should shrink the shirt by about one size.</p>
