Being lost in unfamiliar surroundings can be a frightening experience, especially if you don't know what to do or how to find your way back. Knowing what priorities to take if you become lost can help you stay calm and remain safe until you are found.

<h2>Understand the Basics of Survival</h2>

The third priority is to try to find a reference point and call for help. If you can find a landmark or a recognizable object, such as a road sign or a river, it can help you orient yourself and work out where you are.
