<p>Are you wondering why your dog keeps running away in the Sims 4? You’re not alone! Many Simmers have encountered this frustrating problem and are looking for solutions. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to prevent your pet from escaping and help them stay put.</p>

<h2>Why Does My Dog Keep Running Away in The Sims 4?</h2>

<p>The Sims 4 is a virtual world where your Sims can do just about anything. You can dress them up, build houses, explore new worlds, and even get a pet. But sometimes, pets can be a little pesky. If your furry friend keeps running away, it could be because they’re feeling neglected or their needs aren’t being met. Pets in The Sims 4 need to be taken care of just like in real life. You need to feed them, give them attention, and make sure they’re getting enough exercise. If you don’t do these things, your pet will become unhappy and try to escape.</p>

<p>Another common cause of pets running away in The Sims 4 is boredom. If you’re not playing with your pet or giving them enough toys to keep them entertained, they’ll get restless and wander off. It’s also possible your pet is trying to escape because of another Sim in the household. If someone in the house is mean to the pet or not giving them enough attention, they could be trying to get away from them.</p>

<h2>How to Keep Your Dog From Running Away in The Sims 4</h2>

<p>If you’re having trouble keeping your dog from running away in The Sims 4, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure your pet is getting enough attention and exercise. Spend time playing with them, take them for walks, and make sure their needs are being met. You should also give them plenty of toys to keep them entertained.</p>

<p>It’s also a good idea to give your pet a comfortable place to sleep. If they’re sleeping on the floor or in a cramped space, they’ll be more likely to try to escape.

<p>Finally, try to avoid leaving your pet alone for long periods of time. If you know you’ll be gone for more than a few hours, have someone check on them to make sure they’re not trying to escape. This will give you peace of mind that they’re safe and sound.</p>
