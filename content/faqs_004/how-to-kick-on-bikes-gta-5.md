<h2>What is Kicking on Bikes?</h2>

<p>Kicking on bikes is a technique used to gain speed and momentum while riding a motorcycle in GTA 5.

This will cause the rider to lean forward and put weight on the front wheel, allowing them to travel farther and faster.</p>

<h2>How to Perform a Kick on a Bike</h2>

<p>Kicking on a bike in GTA 5 is fairly simple. First, make sure you're on a motorcycle and have the accelerator pressed.

You can also press the left analog stick (or the right trigger on a controller) to lean the bike back, which will slow it down.</p>

<h2>Tips for Kicking on Bikes</h2>

<p>Kicking on bikes can be tricky, so here are a few tips to help you get the hang of it:</p>
