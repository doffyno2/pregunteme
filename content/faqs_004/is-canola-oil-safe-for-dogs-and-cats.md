<h2>What Is Canola Oil?</h2>

<p>Canola oil is a vegetable oil derived from the seeds of the canola (Brassica napus) plant.

For this reason, it is important to speak with your veterinarian before giving your pet any type of food containing canola oil. It is also important to note that canola oil should never be given to puppies or kittens, as their digestive systems are still developing and may not be able to handle the polyunsaturated fats.</p>
