<p>It is extremely important to get the most out of your driver, and to do this you need to be sure that it is adjusted properly. The Cobra Speedzone Xtreme driver is a great club and if you take the time to adjust it properly you will be able to maximize your distance, accuracy and control. This guide will show you how to properly adjust the club so that you can get the most out of it.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>To properly adjust your Cobra Speedzone Xtreme driver, you will need the following items:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Adjusting the Loft</h2>

<p>The first thing you will want to do when adjusting your Cobra Speedzone Xtreme driver is to adjust the loft. The loft is the angle of the clubface at address, and it is one of the most important factors in determining how far your ball will go. To adjust the loft, you will need to use the adjustment tool that came with the driver. The driver should have a mark on it indicating the loft setting. Simply turn the adjustment tool until the desired loft is reached.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Lie Angle</h2>

<p>The lie angle of your Cobra Speedzone Xtreme driver is the angle of the clubhead relative to the ground when it is at address. This is an important factor in determining how well your shots will be struck. To adjust the lie angle, you will need to use the adjustment tool and a tape measure. You will need to measure the distance between the center of the clubface and the ground. If the lie angle is too flat (clubface is too close to the ground), you will need to turn the adjustment tool to increase the lie angle. If the lie angle is too upright (clubface is too far away from the ground), you will need to turn the adjustment tool to decrease the lie angle.</p>

<h2>Testing the Adjustments</h2>

<p>Once you have made all of the adjustments, you will want to test them to make sure that they are correct. To do this, you will need to set up a golf ball on a tee and hit a few shots.
