<p>The Old School RuneScape (OSRS) is a game that has been around for a long time. Players from all around the world enjoy fishing in OSRS to relax and enjoy the scenery that the game offers. But with so many different types of fish to catch, it can be difficult to decide which is the best for you. Do you choose the mighty Swordfish or the cunning Bass?</p>

<p>Swordfish are one of the toughest fish available in OSRS and are often sought after by experienced fishers. They have a high experience rate per hour and also provide decent rewards. They can be caught using either harpoons or big fishing nets, depending on the player's preference. Harpoons are the recommended tool for catching Swordfish as they can be used from a boat, allowing the player to remain in the same spot for much longer periods. Big fishing nets, however, can also be used to catch Swordfish, but this is only recommended for players who are already quite experienced in fishing.</p>

<p>Bass are also a popular choice amongst fishers. They can be caught with both harpoons and big fishing nets, but harpoons are recommended due to their higher experience rate. Bass have a slightly lower experience rate than Swordfish, but they also provide decent rewards. Unlike Swordfish, Bass can be caught on both land and water, making them a great choice for players who are new to fishing.</p>

<p>So which is better? It really depends on what you're looking for in a fish. If you're looking for a challenge and a high experience rate, then Swordfish is the way to go. However, if you're looking for something a bit easier and more rewarding, then Bass might be the better choice.</p>
