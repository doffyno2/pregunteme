<p>Do you have a leaking Delta shower valve? If so, you are not alone. Leaks in Delta shower valves are very common, and the fix is relatively easy. In this article, we will discuss the steps you need to take to repair a leaking Delta shower valve. </p>

<h2>Why are Delta Shower Valves Prone to Leaks?</h2>

<p>Delta shower valves are designed to be durable and long-lasting. Unfortunately, they are not immune to wear and tear. Over time, the seals can become worn and brittle, leading to leaks. Additionally, the O-rings in the valves can become cracked or damaged, which can also lead to leaks. </p>

<h2>Tools and Materials You Will Need</h2>

<p>Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and materials on hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A flathead screwdriver</li>
  <li>A Phillips head screwdriver</li>
  <li>Replacement O-rings</li>
  <li>Plumber’s tape</li>
  <li>A pair of pliers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Shut off the Water Supply</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a leaking Delta shower valve is to shut off the water supply to the valve. Turn off the main water valve to the house and then locate the shutoff valves for the shower. Once you have located the shutoff valves, turn them off as well. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Handle</h2>

<p>Next, you will need to remove the handle from the valve. Use a flathead screwdriver to unscrew the handle and then pull it off the valve. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Remove the Valve Cartridge</h2>

<p>Once the handle is off, you can remove the valve cartridge. Use a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the screws that hold the cartridge in place. Once the screws are removed, carefully pull the cartridge out of the valve. </p>

<h2>Step 4: Replace the O-Rings</h2>

<p>Now that the cartridge is out, you can replace the O-rings. Remove the old O-rings and replace them with new ones. Make sure to use plumber’s tape to ensure a tight seal. </p>

<h2>Step 5: Reassemble the Valve</h2>

<p>Once you have replaced the O-rings, you can reassemble the valve. Put the cartridge back into the valve and secure it with the screws. Then, put the handle back into place and secure it with the screw. </p>

<h2>Step 6: Turn the Water Back On</h2>

<p>Now that the valve is reassembled, you can turn the water back on. Turn on the shutoff valves for the shower and then turn on the main water valve. Check the valve for any leaks and then turn on the shower to check for leaks as well. </p>
