<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving technique that is used to revive a person who has stopped breathing or whose heart is not beating correctly. It is an incredibly important skill to have, as it can help save someone’s life in a medical emergency. But how many cycles of CPR should be performed?</p>

<p>In most cases, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends performing 3–5 cycles of chest compressions before checking the victim’s pulse and respiration. Each cycle of chest compressions should last approximately two minutes and should include 30 compressions at a rate of 100–120 compressions per minute. After completing each cycle, the rescuer should stop and check the victim’s pulse and respiration. If the victim is still unresponsive and not breathing, continue with another cycle of chest compressions.</p>

<p>The number of cycles of chest compressions recommended by the AHA may vary depending on the situation. For example, if the victim is an infant, the AHA recommends performing 2–2.5 cycles of chest compressions before checking the pulse and respiration. If the victim is a child, the AHA recommends performing 3–4 cycles of chest compressions before checking the pulse and respiration.</p>

<p>If the victim is an adult, the AHA recommends performing 5 cycles of chest compressions before checking the pulse and respiration. It is important to note that the AHA guidelines recommend that CPR should be performed until the victim is revived or medical help arrives. If the victim is not revived after 5 cycles of chest compressions, it is recommended to continue performing CPR until medical help arrives.</p>

<p>The importance of performing CPR correctly cannot be overstated. Performing CPR incorrectly can lead to serious injury or death. It is important to be properly trained in CPR before attempting to perform it. You can find a CPR training course near you or take an online course.</p>
