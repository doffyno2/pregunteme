<h2>What is Plan B?</h2>

Plan B is a type of emergency contraception that can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. It is a one-time dose of levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone that is similar to progesterone found naturally in the body. Plan B works to delay or prevent ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovary. It can also stop a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, which is the first step in pregnancy. 

<h2>What are the Side Effects of Plan B?</h2>

The most common side effects of Plan B are nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and headaches. Other less reported side effects can include abdominal pain, dizziness, breast tenderness, and changes in menstrual bleeding. Plan B can also affect your menstrual cycle, causing it to become irregular or even stop altogether. 

<h2>Does Plan B Mess Up Your Menstrual Cycle?</h2>

It is possible for Plan B to disrupt your menstrual cycle. If you take Plan B within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, it can delay your period. Plan B may also cause your next period to come earlier or later than expected. It can also cause spotting, which is light bleeding between periods. 

In some cases, Plan B can cause your period to stop completely. This is more likely to occur if you take Plan B more than once within the same cycle. This can be due to the disruption of the hormones in your body, which can interfere with the regularity of your menstrual cycle. 

<h2>How Long Does it Take for Plan B to Mess Up Your Menstrual Cycle?</h2>

It can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks for Plan B to interfere with your menstrual cycle. It is important to remember that Plan B is a one-time dose and does not provide ongoing protection against pregnancy. If you have unprotected intercourse again, you will need to take another dose of Plan B. 

<h2>What Should You Do If Plan B Messes Up Your Menstrual Cycle?</h2>

If you take Plan B and your menstrual cycle does not return to normal within a few weeks, you should talk to your doctor or healthcare provider. They can help you determine if there is a more serious underlying problem that needs to be addressed. In some cases, they may recommend that you take a pregnancy test or undergo further testing to determine the cause of your irregular menstrual cycle. 

<h2>What Are the Alternatives to Plan B?</h2>

If you are concerned about the potential side effects of Plan B, there are other forms of emergency contraception available. These include Ella and the copper IUD. Unlike Plan B, these methods can provide ongoing protection against pregnancy. The copper IUD can be inserted up to five days after unprotected intercourse and can remain in place for up to 10 years.
