Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is located within the UTC+8 time zone. This means that the current time in Manila is 8 hours ahead of Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). In Manila, the clocks follow Philippine Standard Time (PST). This is also the same time used by most parts of the Philippines, including the provinces of Aklan, Albay, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, and Palawan.

<h2>What is Philippine Standard Time (PST)?</h2>

Philippine Standard Time (PST) is the official time zone of the Philippines. It is 8 hours ahead of Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) and is used by the majority of the Philippine provinces. PST is used to set the clocks in the country and to determine the current time in Manila and other parts of the Philippines.

<h2>How is PST Determined?</h2>

Philippine Standard Time (PST) is determined by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). This is the government agency responsible for setting the official time in the Philippines. NAMRIA issues a National Time Reference Bulletin to notify the general public when the time is changed.

<h2>How Does the Philippine Time Zone Affect Daylight Savings Time?</h2>

The Philippines does not observe daylight savings time (DST). This means that the clocks in the Philippines stay the same throughout the year and there are no adjustments made for the summer months. The current time in Manila and other parts of the Philippines always remains 8 hours ahead of Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

<h2>What Other Time Zones Are Used in the Philippines?</h2>

Aside from Philippine Standard Time (PST), there are two other time zones used in the Philippines. The first is the Philippine Eastern Standard Time (PEST), which is 9 hours ahead of UTC. This time zone is used by the provinces of Batanes and Cagayan. The second is the Philippine Western Standard Time (PWST), which is 7 hours ahead of UTC. The provinces of Apayao, Kalinga, and Mountain Province use this time zone.

<h2>How to Convert UTC to Manila Time?</h2>

To convert UTC to Manila time, simply add 8 hours to the current time in UTC. For example, if the current time in UTC is 12:00 pm, the current time in Manila will be 8:00 pm.
