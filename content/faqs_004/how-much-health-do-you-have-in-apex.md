<h2>What are the Different Types of Health in Apex?</h2>

There are two different types of health in Apex: physical health and shield health. Physical health is the amount of damage a player can take before they are eliminated from the game. Shield health is the amount of damage a player can take before their shields break and they are left with just their physical health.

<h2>How Much Physical Health Do You Have in Apex?</h2>

The amount of physical health that a player has in Apex depends on which character they choose to play as. Each character has a different base health level, which is then modified by the player's chosen items, such as armor or health packs, to increase the amount of physical health they have. The maximum amount of physical health that a player can have is 100.

<h2>How Much Shield Health Do You Have in Apex?</h2>

The amount of shield health that a player has in Apex depends on which character they choose to play as.

The maximum amount of shield health that a player can have is 200.

<h2>How Do You Increase Your Health in Apex?</h2>

Players can increase their health in Apex by using items such as armor and shields, as well as by finding and using health packs scattered throughout the map.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Having More Health in Apex?</h2>

Having more health in Apex can be beneficial in a variety of ways. Players with higher amounts of health will be able to endure more damage before being eliminated from the game, giving them an advantage over players with lower amounts of health. Additionally, players with higher amounts of health can also use their shields more often, as they will have more shield health to work with.

<h2>What Are the Drawbacks Of Having More Health in Apex?</h2>

Having more health in Apex can also be a double-edged sword.
