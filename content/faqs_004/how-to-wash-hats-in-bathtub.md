<p>Washing hats in the bathtub is a common way to clean them, and it's much easier than you might think. With the right preparation and a few simple steps, you can have your hats looking like new in no time. Read on to learn how to safely and effectively wash hats in the bathtub. </p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>
<p>Before you start washing your hats in the bathtub, you'll need to gather a few supplies. You'll need a mild detergent, a soft-bristled brush, a clean cloth, and a towel. Depending on the type of fabric your hat is made from, you may also need a mild bleach solution, or a fabric-safe cleaner.</p>

<h2>Preparing Your Hat</h2>
<p>Before you start washing your hat in the bathtub, you'll need to prepare it. Start by brushing away any dirt or debris that may be caught in the fabric. If there are any stubborn stains, use a small amount of the mild detergent or cleaner and gently scrub them away. Once you've removed any dirt and stains, give the hat a good shake to remove any excess water or soap.</p>

<h2>Filling the Bathtub</h2>
<p>Once your hat is prepared, it's time to fill the bathtub. Fill the tub with lukewarm water and add a small amount of the mild detergent or fabric-safe cleaner. Make sure the water isn't too hot or too cold, as this can damage the fabrics of your hat. Once the water is at the right temperature, place your hat in the tub and let it soak for a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Cleaning the Hat</h2>
<p>Once your hat has been soaking in the tub for a few minutes, it's time to start cleaning it. Using the soft-bristled brush, gently scrub away any dirt or debris that may be stuck in the fabric. For any stubborn stains, use a small amount of the mild detergent or cleaner and gently scrub them away. Once the hat is clean, rinse it off with clean water.</p>

<h2>Drying Your Hat</h2>
<p>Once your hat is clean and rinsed, it's time to dry it. Place the hat on a clean towel and pat it dry. If the hat is still damp, place it in a warm, dry place and allow it to air dry. Do not attempt to dry your hat in the dryer, as this can cause the fabric to shrink or become misshapen.</p>
