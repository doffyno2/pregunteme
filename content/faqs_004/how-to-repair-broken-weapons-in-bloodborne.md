<p>Bloodborne is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game is set in a Gothic Victorian era city in which players battle nightmarish creatures, including bosses, using a variety of weapons. While most weapons are available to purchase from merchants, some weapons can only be obtained by repairing broken weapons.</p>

<h2>What is a Broken Weapon?</h2>

<p>A broken weapon is a weapon that has been damaged by enemy attacks or other means. Broken weapons have reduced stats and cannot be used until they are repaired. The only way to repair a broken weapon is to find an NPC in-game that offers a repair service.</p>

<h2>Where to Find NPCs Offering Repair Services?</h2>

<p>NPCs offering repair services can be found in several locations in the game. They can be found in the Hunter's Dream, in the Cathedral Ward, and in some of the Chalice Dungeons. In the Hunter's Dream, the NPC offering repair services is called the Doll Maker. In the Cathedral Ward, the NPC offering repair services is called the Workshop Leader. In the Chalice Dungeons, the NPC offering repair services is called the Tomb Prospector.</p>

<h2>What is the Process for Repairing Broken Weapons?</h2>

<p>The process for repairing broken weapons is fairly straightforward. First, the player must find an NPC that offers repair services. Once the NPC is found, the player must pay a fee to repair the weapon. The amount of the fee will vary depending on the type of weapon being repaired. Once the fee is paid, the weapon will be repaired and can be used again.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Repairing Broken Weapons?</h2>

<p>The primary benefit of repairing broken weapons is that it allows players to use the weapons again. In addition, repairing weapons can also restore the stats of the weapon to their original levels. This can be especially useful for weapons that have been heavily damaged by enemy attacks.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Downsides to Repairing Broken Weapons?</h2>

<p>The main downside to repairing broken weapons is the cost. Repairing a weapon can be expensive, especially if the weapon is heavily damaged. Additionally, some weapons cannot be repaired at all, and must be replaced with a new weapon.</p>
