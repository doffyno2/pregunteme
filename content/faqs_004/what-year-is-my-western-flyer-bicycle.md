<p>Western Flyer bicycles are one of the most iconic and popular models of bicycles in the United States. They were first introduced in the late 1800s and have been a beloved part of American culture ever since. For many people, owning a Western Flyer bicycle is a dream come true. But if you have a Western Flyer bicycle, how can you tell what year it was made?</p>

<p>Identifying the year of a Western Flyer bicycle can be tricky.

Fortunately, there are a few ways you can determine the year of your Western Flyer bicycle.</p>
