<p>If you’ve ever gone bra shopping, you may have noticed that sizes can be a little confusing. Different styles, brands, and materials can all affect the size and fit of a bra, but there’s one number that stays the same: the cup size. So, how big is an A cup bra?</p>

<p>The cup size of a bra is determined by measuring the difference between your bust size and your ribcage. The number of inches of difference determines the letter size. For example, if your bust measures 32 inches and your ribcage measures 28 inches, the difference is 4 inches. A four-inch difference is an A cup.</p>

<p>An A cup is the smallest cup size available, and it typically fits women with a bust size of 32 inches or smaller. For those with a larger bust size, the cup size increases with each additional inch of difference between the bust and ribcage. So, if your bust measures 33 inches and your ribcage measures 28 inches, the difference is 5 inches and you would need a B cup.</p>

<p>When shopping for an A cup bra, keep in mind that the cup size is not the only factor in determining fit. Different styles, brands, and materials can all affect the fit of a bra. It’s important to try on different styles and sizes to find the one that fits you best. If a bra is too small, it can be uncomfortable and create bulges. If it’s too large, it can be loose and not provide enough support.</p>

<h2>How to Measure for an A Cup Bra</h2>

<p>To find the right A cup bra size, you need to measure both your bust and ribcage. To measure your bust, wrap a measuring tape around your back and around the fullest part of your bust. To measure your ribcage, wrap the measuring tape around your back and around the smallest part of your ribcage, just below your bust. The difference between the two measurements is your cup size. If the difference is four inches or less, you will need an A cup.</p>

<p>If you are having difficulty measuring your bust and ribcage, you may want to consider getting fitted for a bra by a professional. Professional bra fitters are trained to measure and fit bras for women of all sizes and shapes. They can also help you find styles and brands that will fit you best.</p>
