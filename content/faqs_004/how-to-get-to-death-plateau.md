How to Get to Death Plateau



Death Plateau is a high-level quest in Old School Runescape. The quest is the second of the five quests in the Troll Warzone quest series. It follows The Death of Chivalry and leads into the final quest, The Branches of Darkmeyer. Death Plateau is one of the longer quests in Runescape and can be somewhat difficult to complete. In this article, we will discuss how to get to Death Plateau, the requirements for completing the quest, and strategies for completing it.



In order to begin Death Plateau, players must have completed The Death of Chivalry and have a combat level of at least 40. Additionally, they must have either completed the Troll Stronghold quest or have an agility level of at least 30. Players should also bring food, armor, and weapons to protect themselves from the trolls and other enemies they will encounter.



Once players have met the requirements, they can begin their journey to Death Plateau. The first step is to travel to Burthorpe, which is located south of the Troll Stronghold. Once in Burthorpe, players should talk to the Burthorpe Guard Captain and tell him they are ready to begin the quest. He will give players a map and instructions for getting to the plateau.

Players should then travel to the Trollweiss Mountain, which is located north of Burthorpe. Once there, they must climb up the mountain using the rocks as footholds. Once they reach the top, they will be able to see Death Plateau in the distance.



Once players have reached Death Plateau, they must find and defeat the trolls. To do this, they should search the area for the troll camp and then attack the trolls with their weapons and armor. After defeating the trolls, players will be rewarded with a quest point and the quest will be complete.



There are a few strategies players can use to make completing Death Plateau easier. First, they should bring along food, armor, and weapons to make the fight against the trolls easier. Additionally, they should look for areas where the trolls are congregated and attack them as a group for maximum effectiveness. Finally, players should be aware of their surroundings and try to use the terrain to their advantage.
