<p>Shopping for shoes can be a tricky business. With so many different shapes, sizes, and widths to choose from, it can be difficult to decide which shoes are the best fit. One size doesn’t always fit all, and it’s important to understand your foot shape and size to make sure you’re choosing the right shoes for you. But when it comes to widths, how much wider are wide shoes than the average size?</p>

<p>The width of a shoe is determined by the size of the last – the foot-shaped form that the shoe is built around. The last is measured in millimeters, and a shoe’s width is determined by the difference between the length of the last and the width of the last. The average size of a men’s last is 97mm, while the average size of a women’s last is 82mm. The difference between the length and width of the last is called the width factor.</p>

<p>The width factor for a wide shoe is typically 1.5 times larger than the width factor for an average size shoe. In other words, a wide shoe is typically about 1.5 times wider than an average size shoe. For example, a men’s shoe with a width factor of 1.5 would be 145mm wide, while a women’s shoe with a width factor of 1.5 would be 123mm wide.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that different brands and styles of shoes may have slightly different width factors, so it’s important to check the width factor before making a purchase. Additionally, some brands offer extra-wide shoes, which have a width factor of 2 or more times larger than the average size shoe. Extra-wide shoes can be a great option for those with wider feet.</p>

Extra-wide shoes are typically recommended for those with very wide or irregularly shaped feet.</p>
