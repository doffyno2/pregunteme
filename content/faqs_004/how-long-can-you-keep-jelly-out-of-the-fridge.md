<p>Jelly is a delicious treat that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults alike. But like most foods, it has a shelf life and needs to be stored correctly to ensure it stays safe to eat. So, how long can you keep jelly out of the fridge?</p>

<p>Jelly is a sweet, gelatinous spread that is made from fruit or vegetables. It is similar to jam, but it has a smoother, more jelly-like consistency. Jelly is typically served on toast, sandwiches, and other snacks, and it is a great way to add a boost of flavor to your meal.</p>

<p>When it comes to storage, jelly should be kept in the refrigerator. The cold temperature helps to slow down the growth of bacteria and preserve the flavor and texture of the jelly. Jelly can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one month.</p>

<p>But what if you don’t have access to a refrigerator? Are there any other ways to store jelly without refrigeration?</p>

<p>The answer is yes. Jelly can be stored at room temperature for up to two weeks. However, it’s important to keep in mind that jelly will spoil faster when it’s not stored in the refrigerator. To help keep your jelly fresh, it is best to store it in an airtight container or jar in a cool, dry place.</p>

<p>It’s also important to remember that jelly should not be left out at room temperature for more than two hours. Bacteria can grow quickly in warm temperatures, so it is important to keep jelly away from direct sources of heat, such as an oven or stovetop.</p>

<h2>Can You Freeze Jelly?</h2>

<p>If you want to extend the shelf life of your jelly, you can freeze it. Jelly can be frozen for up to six months. To freeze jelly, transfer it to an airtight container or resealable plastic bag. When you're ready to use it, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
