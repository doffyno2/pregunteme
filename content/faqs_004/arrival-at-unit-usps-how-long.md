# Arrival at USPS - How Long Does It Take? 

USPS, or the United States Postal Service, is the main provider of postal services in the United States. USPS is known for its reliable delivery services, but how long does it take for your package to arrive once it's in the hands of USPS? 

## What is USPS? 

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is an independent government agency that provides postal services in the United States. It is responsible for delivering letters, packages, and other mail items to all parts of the country. The agency is also responsible for issuing postage stamps, handling money orders, and providing other services related to the postal service. 

## Understanding USPS Delivery Times 

When you send a package through USPS, there are two main factors that determine how long it will take for your package to arrive: the origin and destination of the package, and the type of service you choose. The origin and destination of a package will determine the distance your package needs to travel, while the type of service you choose will determine the speed of delivery. 

For example, USPS offers two types of services: Priority Mail and Express Mail. Priority Mail offers standard delivery times that are usually between three and five business days, while Express Mail delivers packages within one to two business days. 

## Calculating Delivery Times 

When calculating delivery times for your package, it is important to consider the day of the week that you are sending your package. For example, if you are sending a package on a Monday, it will usually arrive by the end of the week, while a package sent on a Friday will usually arrive by the following Tuesday or Wednesday. 

It is also important to note that USPS does not deliver packages on Sundays or federal holidays. Therefore, if you are sending a package on a Friday and there is a federal holiday during the weekend, your package will not arrive until the following Tuesday or Wednesday. 

## Delivery Time Frames 

The delivery time frame for packages sent through USPS depends on the type of service you choose. Priority Mail is generally the cheapest option, but it also has the slowest delivery times. Express Mail is the fastest option and usually arrives within one to two business days. 

Regardless of the type of service you choose, USPS guarantees that packages will arrive within two weeks of the date they are shipped. This is known as the "delivery time frame" and it is included in the price of the postage. 

## Tracking Your Package 

When you send a package through USPS, you will receive a tracking number that you can use to track the progress of your package. This number will allow you to see when your package was shipped, when it arrived at its destination, and when it was delivered. 

In addition to tracking your package, USPS also offers a service called "USPS Delivery Confirmation". With this service, you can receive an email or text message when your package is delivered. This is a useful service for those who are expecting packages and want to know when they have arrived.
