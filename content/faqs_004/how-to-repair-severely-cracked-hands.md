<p>Having cracked hands can be a painful and embarrassing experience, as it can make even the most basic of tasks difficult. Cracked hands can be caused by a number of factors, including dryness, cold weather, and certain medical conditions. Fortunately, there are several ways to repair severely cracked hands and restore them to their original softness and health. </p>

<h2>What Causes Cracked Hands?</h2>

<p>There are several factors that can lead to cracked hands, including dryness, cold weather, and certain medical conditions. Dryness is one of the most common causes of cracked hands, as it can cause the skin to become brittle and crack. Exposure to cold weather can also cause the skin to become dry and cracked. Additionally, some medical conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis, can make the skin more prone to cracking. </p>

<h2>How to Repair Severely Cracked Hands</h2>

<h3>1. Moisturize</h3>

<p>One of the most effective ways to repair severely cracked hands is to regularly moisturize them. Moisturizing the hands helps to keep the skin hydrated, which in turn helps to prevent further cracking. It is best to use a moisturizer specifically designed for dry skin, as this will provide the most effective hydration. It is important to apply the moisturizer several times a day, as this will help to keep the skin hydrated and protected from further cracking. </p>

<h3>2. Wear Gloves</h3>

<p>Wearing gloves is another effective way to repair severely cracked hands. Gloves help to protect the hands from further damage, as they keep the skin covered and protected. Additionally, gloves can help to keep the hands warm, which can help to prevent further cracking. It is important to choose gloves that are made from a breathable fabric, such as cotton or wool, as this will help to keep the hands warm without causing them to become too hot. </p>

<h3>3. Change Your Diet</h3>

<p>Making changes to your diet can also help to repair severely cracked hands. Eating a balanced diet that is rich in vitamins and minerals can help to nourish the skin and keep it healthy. Additionally, eating foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids can help to keep the skin hydrated and reduce the risk of cracking. </p>

<h3>4. Avoid Hot Water</h3>

Additionally, it is important to avoid using harsh soaps and detergents, as these can further dry out the skin and make it more prone to cracking. </p>

<h3>5. Use Natural Oils</h3>

<p>Using natural oils can also help to repair severely cracked hands. Natural oils such as coconut oil, olive oil, and almond oil are all effective at moisturizing and nourishing the skin. These oils can be applied directly to the hands, or they can be mixed with a carrier oil such as jojoba oil and then applied. </p>
