<p>Fish ceviche is a delicious and refreshing dish made of cooked fish, lime juice, and vegetables. It is a popular dish in Latin America and among seafood lovers everywhere. While it can be eaten immediately after it is prepared, it is often left in the refrigerator to marinate and develop a more intense flavor. But how long can you safely store fish ceviche in the refrigerator?</p>

<h2>Understanding the Basics of Fish Ceviche</h2>

<p>Fish ceviche is made using a method called “cooking” with citrus juice. The acid in the juice denatures the proteins in the fish, giving it a cooked texture. This method also has the benefit of killing off any bacteria that may be present in the fish. This makes it a safe option for eating raw fish.</p>

<p>The fish is usually combined with lime juice, onion, garlic, cilantro, and a variety of other seasonings, depending on the recipe. The ingredients are then left to marinate in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the fish to become more tender.</p>

<h2>How Long Can You Store Fish Ceviche in the Fridge?</h2>

<p>Fish ceviche can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days. After two days, the acid in the lime juice begins to break down the proteins in the fish, making it unsafe to eat. It is also important to keep in mind that fish ceviche is best when eaten fresh. The longer it sits in the refrigerator, the less flavor it will have.</p>

<p>It is also important to be aware that fish ceviche can become contaminated by other items in the refrigerator. For this reason, it is important to keep it in a sealed container or wrap it in plastic wrap before storing it. This will help to prevent cross-contamination.</p>

<h2>How to Tell if Fish Ceviche Has Gone Bad</h2>

<p>If fish ceviche has been stored in the refrigerator for longer than two days, it is important to check it for signs of spoilage. Fish ceviche that has gone bad will have an off odor, a slimy texture, and an unappetizing color. If any of these signs are present, it is best to discard the fish ceviche and not consume it.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Fish Ceviche</h2>

<p>When storing fish ceviche, it is important to use a sealed container or wrap it in plastic wrap to prevent cross-contamination. It is also important to store it in the coldest part of the refrigerator, such as the back or bottom shelf. This will help to keep the fish ceviche fresh and safe to eat.</p>

<p>It is also important to consume fish ceviche within two days of preparation. After two days, the fish may become unsafe to consume. If you plan on storing the fish ceviche for longer than two days, it is best to freeze it for up to two months.</p>
