Expiration dates are an important part of food safety and should not be ignored. Knowing how to read expiration dates can help you identify expired food and make sure that you are consuming the freshest and safest foods available. This article will explain how to read expiration dates so you can make sure you are eating safe and delicious foods.

<h2>What Does an Expiration Date Mean?</h2>

An expiration date is a date printed on a food item or package that indicates when the food should be consumed or discarded. This date is usually a "use by" date, which is the last day that the food should be eaten. After this date, the food is no longer safe to eat. 

<h2>What Types of Food Have Expiration Dates?</h2>

Most foods that require refrigeration have expiration dates. This includes dairy products, meats, eggs, and prepared foods. Other foods with expiration dates include canned goods, snacks, and frozen foods. Some foods, such as grains, nuts, and dried fruit, do not have expiration dates, but should still be consumed within a few months of purchase. 

<h2>How to Read Expiration Dates</h2>

Expiration dates are usually printed on the product in one of two ways. The first is a "use by" date, which is the last day that the food should be eaten. This date is usually printed on the package in the form of a month and year, such as "05/2021." The second type of date is a "sell by" date, which is the last day that the food should be sold. This date is usually printed on the package in the form of a month and year, such as "05/2021." 

<h2>What Happens if You Eat Expired Food?</h2>

Eating expired food can lead to food poisoning, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. If you experience any of these symptoms after eating expired food, contact your doctor immediately. 

<h2>How to Store Food for Maximum Shelf Life</h2>

Storing food properly can help extend its shelf life and ensure that it is safe to eat. Make sure to store food in the refrigerator or freezer, if applicable. Canned goods should be stored in a cool, dry place. Foods should also be sealed tightly to keep out moisture and contaminants. 

<h2>What Foods Should You Avoid Eating Past Their Expiration Date?</h2>

Some foods should never be eaten past their expiration date. These include dairy products, meats, eggs, and prepared foods. In addition, any food that has been opened should not be eaten after its expiration date. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Expiration dates are an important part of food safety and should not be ignored. Knowing how to read expiration dates can help you identify expired food and make sure that you are consuming the freshest and safest foods available. Additionally, proper storage and avoiding eating expired food can help extend the shelf life of food and ensure that it is safe to eat.
