<h2>Introduction</h2>

The War of the Worlds is one of the most iconic science fiction stories ever written. Written by the legendary author H.G. Wells in 1898, the story portrays a world where aliens attempt to take over the planet, only to be defeated by an unknown force. While the aliens are defeated, the story does not explain what it was that killed them. Over the years, many theories have been proposed as to what caused the aliens’ demise, from viruses to divine intervention. In this article, we will explore some of the most popular explanations for what killed the aliens in the War of the Worlds.

<h2>Theory 1: Viruses</h2>

The first theory suggests that the aliens were killed by a virus that originated on Earth. This theory proposes that the aliens were not immune to the virus, which caused them to become ill and eventually die. This theory is supported by the fact that the aliens were shown to have difficulty breathing, and that they were quickly overwhelmed by the virus.

<h2>Theory 2: Divine Intervention</h2>

The second theory suggests that the aliens were killed by divine intervention. This theory states that God or some other higher power intervened to save humanity from the aliens. This theory is supported by the fact that the aliens were defeated in a very short period of time, which could be seen as miraculous.

<h2>Theory 3: Natural Weapons</h2>

The third theory suggests that the aliens were killed by natural weapons. This theory proposes that the aliens were killed by weapons that were already present on Earth, such as guns and explosives. This theory is supported by the fact that the aliens were shown to be vulnerable to conventional weapons.

<h2>Theory 4: Advanced Technology</h2>

The fourth theory suggests that the aliens were killed by advanced technology. This theory proposes that the aliens were killed by weapons or technology that was not yet available on Earth. This theory is supported by the fact that the aliens were quickly overwhelmed by a mysterious force, which could have been an advanced weapon.
