Stitches can be uncomfortable and itchy, especially when they are healing. If you are dealing with an itchy stitch, there are a few things you can do to make it stop itching. In this article, we'll discuss the best ways to make stitches stop itching and promote healing.

<h2>What Causes Stitches to Itch?</h2>

Stitches can itch for a variety of reasons, but the main cause is the bodyâ€™s healing process. The body signals the immune system to repair any damaged tissue, which causes inflammation and itching. This is a normal part of the healing process and is not something to be alarmed about.

<h2>How to Make Stitches Stop Itching</h2>

There are a few things you can do to make stitches stop itching and promote healing. 

<h3>Keep Your Wound Clean</h3>

The first step to make stitches stop itching is to keep the wound clean. This helps to prevent infection and promotes faster healing. Clean the wound with warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or cotton swab. Be sure to use a gentle cleanser so as not to irritate the wound. Pat the wound dry with a soft cloth and apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment.

<h3>Wear Loose-Fitting Clothing</h3>

Wearing tight-fitting clothing can cause irritation and make stitches itch. Wear loose-fitting clothing that won't rub against the wound. If the wound is in an area that is difficult to cover with clothing, consider using a bandage to keep the wound clean and protected.

<h3>Take an Anti-Itch Cream or Ointment</h3>

Using an anti-itch cream or ointment can help to soothe the itch and promote healing. Look for an ointment or cream that contains ingredients such as corticosteroids, calamine, or menthol. Apply the cream or ointment to the wound and surrounding area a few times a day.

<h3>Use a Cold Compress</h3>

Applying a cold compress to the wound can help to reduce inflammation and itching. Use a cold compress for 10-15 minutes at a time. You can also use a cold pack or ice pack for the same purpose.

<h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>

If the itching persists or gets worse, see a doctor. The doctor may prescribe a stronger anti-itch cream or an oral medication to reduce the itching. The doctor may also recommend a different type of dressing for the wound.
