Github is a powerful and popular open-source code-sharing platform that is used by millions of developers around the world. It allows users to share their code with the world, collaborate on projects, and even host private repositories that are only accessible by invited users.

However, there may be times when you want to make your private repositories available to the public, or at least to a select group of people. This can be especially useful if you have a project that you want to keep private, but still want to be able to access it from anywhere. Fortunately, Github makes it easy to do this. In this guide, we’ll show you how to make private github repos available through a link.

<h2>Why Would You Want to Make Your Private Github Repos Available?</h2>

There are a few reasons why you might want to make a private Github repo available to the public or a select group of people.

First, it can be useful for collaboration. If you’re working on a project with multiple people, it can be difficult to keep track of who has access to what files. By making your repo available, you can easily grant access to anyone who needs it.

Second, it can be helpful if you need to share the repo with someone who doesn’t have a Github account. For example, if you’re working on a project that requires outside input from people who don’t have a Github account, you can easily share the repo with them through a link.

Finally, it can be useful if you want to be able to access your repo from anywhere. If you’re away from your computer and need to access your repo, you can do so with a link.

<h2>How to Make Private Github Repos Available Through Link</h2>

Making a private Github repo available through a link is easy. First, log into your Github account and navigate to the repo you want to make available. Then, click on the “Settings” tab.

On the Settings page, scroll down to the “Collaborators” section and click “Add Collaborators”.

Enter the email address of the person you want to give access to the repo and click “Add Collaborator”. The person you’ve added will now be able to access your private repo.

You can also add multiple people by entering their email addresses separated by commas. When you’re done, click “Add Collaborators”.

Once you’ve added the collaborators, scroll down to the “Link Sharing” section. Here, you’ll see a link that you can share with anyone you want to give access to the repo.
