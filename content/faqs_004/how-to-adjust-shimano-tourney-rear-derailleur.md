<p>The Shimano Tourney rear derailleur is an affordable and reliable component of the Shimano range of bicycle components. It is designed to provide smooth, reliable shifting of the chain between the rear cogs, allowing you to quickly and easily change gear on your bike. Knowing how to adjust a Shimano Tourney rear derailleur is essential to getting the most out of your bike and ensuring it is running optimally.</p>

<h2>Tools and Supplies Needed</h2>

<p>Before attempting to adjust your Shimano Tourney rear derailleur, you will need the following tools and supplies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screwdriver</li>
  <li>Bicycle chain lube</li>
  <li>Bicycle chain tool</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1 – Check the Limit Screws</h2>

<p>The first step in adjusting your Shimano Tourney rear derailleur is to check the limit screws. The limit screws are located on the derailleur, and they control how far the derailleur can move each way. You will need to adjust these screws if the derailleur is not shifting properly.</p>

<h2>Step 2 – Adjust the Cable Tension</h2>

<p>Once the limit screws are adjusted, you will need to adjust the cable tension. The cable tension is what controls how much force the derailleur applies to the chain when shifting. To adjust the cable tension, you will need to turn the barrel adjuster located on the derailleur itself.</p>

<h2>Step 3 – Check the Chain Tension</h2>

<p>Once the cable tension is adjusted, you will need to check the chain tension. The chain should be tight enough so that it does not rub on the derailleur cage, but loose enough that it can move freely. If the chain is too tight, you may need to adjust the derailleur’s limit screws again.</p>

<h2>Step 4 – Lubricate the Chain</h2>

<p>Once the chain tension is adjusted, you will need to lubricate the chain. This will help ensure that the chain is running smoothly, and prevent it from rusting and becoming damaged. You can use any type of bicycle chain lube for this, but make sure to apply it to the entire length of the chain.</p>

<h2>Step 5 – Test the Shifting</h2>

<p>Once the chain is lubricated, you will need to test the shifting. You can do this by pedaling your bicycle in a low gear, and then shifting up to a higher gear. If the shifting is smooth and the chain is not rubbing on the derailleur cage, then your Shimano Tourney rear derailleur is properly adjusted.</p>
