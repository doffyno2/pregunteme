Ghost Rider is an iconic Marvel comic book character, and the movie adaptation of the same name was a big hit. But who was responsible for building the bike that Ghost Rider rode? In this article, we'll take a look at the people who built the iconic bike and how they made it a reality.

<h2>The Ghost Rider Bike</h2>

The Ghost Rider bike is one of the most iconic vehicles in all of cinema. It has become an integral part of the Ghost Rider character and is a symbol of the movie. The bike was designed to be a “chopper” style bike, which is a type of motorcycle that has been modified for a more modern look. The bike was built for the movie and is not a real bike that can be purchased.

<h2>The Builders of the Bike</h2>

The builders of the Ghost Rider bike were two talented custom bike builders from the United Kingdom. Their names are Peter Wilchowski and Rob Galloway, and they are the two men responsible for bringing the Ghost Rider bike to life.

<h3>Peter Wilchowski</h3>

Peter Wilchowski is a master of custom bike building and has been in the business for over 25 years. He began his career as a mechanic and has worked on some of the most iconic bikes in the world. Peter has worked on a wide range of projects, from custom motorcycles to custom cars. He has also worked on some of the most iconic films of all time, including the original Mad Max films and the first Star Wars films.

<h3>Rob Galloway</h3>

He has worked on a variety of projects, from custom cars to custom motorcycles. Rob is an expert at custom fabrication and is known for his attention to detail. He has also built some of the most iconic bikes in the world, including the original Terminator bike.

<h2>How the Bike Was Built</h2>

The build process for the Ghost Rider bike was a long and complicated one. Peter and Rob worked together to create a bike that was as close as possible to the original comic book design. They started with a Harley-Davidson Softail frame and used it as the basis for the bike. They then added a variety of custom parts, including a custom fuel tank, handlebars, foot pegs, and exhaust. 

The bike was then painted with a custom paint job. The paint job was designed to resemble the comic book version of the bike, and it was finished with a chrome-plated finish. The final touches were added, such as the addition of the iconic skull on the front of the bike. 

<h2>The Result</h2>

The result of Peter and Rob's hard work was a bike that is as close as possible to the comic book version of the Ghost Rider bike. The bike has become an iconic piece of cinema and is instantly recognizable to fans of the Ghost Rider movies.
