<p>Wooden gates are an excellent way to add a bit of extra security to your home. They can be used to keep children and pets safe, as well as keep out unwanted visitors. However, because they are made of wood, they are susceptible to rotting, warping, and rusting. If you have a high external wooden gate that is showing signs of rust, you may be wondering what to do. </p>

<p>In this guide, we will cover everything you need to know about repairing high external wooden gate rust. We will discuss the common causes of rust, the best methods of repairing it, and the steps you need to take to make sure your wooden gate stays rust-free for years to come.</p>

<h2>What Causes Rust on Wooden Gates?</h2>

<p>Rust can occur on any type of metal, but it is particularly common on outdoor wooden gates. This is because outdoor wooden gates are exposed to the elements, including rain and snow. They can also be exposed to salt water if they are near a beach or ocean. The moisture and salt combine to create a perfect environment for rusting to occur. </p>

<p>Wooden gates that are not properly sealed or coated can also be prone to rusting. If your wooden gate is not sealed or coated, the moisture and salt can seep into the wood and cause rust to form. It is important to seal or coat your wooden gate to protect it from the elements and prevent rusting.</p>

<h2>How to Repair High External Wooden Gate Rust</h2>

<p>Once rust has formed on your wooden gate, you need to take steps to repair it. The first step is to remove any loose or flaking rust. This can be done with a wire brush, sandpaper, or a steel wool pad. Once the rust has been removed, you can begin to repair the area. </p>

<p>The next step is to fill in the area with a rust-resistant filler. This can be purchased at most hardware stores and comes in a variety of colors and textures. Make sure you choose a filler that is designed to be used on metal, as other types of fillers may not provide adequate protection. Once the filler has been applied, allow it to dry completely before applying a coat of paint.</p>

<h2>How to Prevent High External Wooden Gate Rust</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent rust from forming on your wooden gate is to keep it sealed and coated.
