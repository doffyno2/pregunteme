<p>Dreadlocks have been around for centuries and have become a popular hairstyle for those looking to make a statement with their look. But making your dreadlocks lock quickly and efficiently can be a tricky process. There are several methods you can use to make your dreadlocks form faster, but it’s important to understand what makes them form in the first place. In this article, we’ll explore the different techniques you can use to make your dreadlocks form faster and look great.</p>
 
<h2>What Makes Dreads Lock?</h2>

<p>Dreads form when the hair is twisted together tightly. As the hair gets twisted, the individual strands start to intertwine with each other, creating a locking effect. This process is what makes dreadlocks form, but it can take some time depending on the length and thickness of the hair.</p>
