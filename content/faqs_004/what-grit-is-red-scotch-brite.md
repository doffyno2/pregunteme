<p>Scotch-Brite is a popular abrasive cleaning pad used for a variety of tasks. It is made of a flexible web of synthetic fibers that are coated in an abrasive material such as aluminum oxide. Scotch-Brite pads come in a variety of colors, each of which indicates the type of abrasive material it contains and the degree of abrasiveness. Red Scotch-Brite pads are the most abrasive type, but what grit are they?</p>

<h2>What Is Grit?</h2>

<p>Grit is a measure of the coarseness or fineness of an abrasive material, such as the aluminum oxide found in Scotch-Brite pads. The larger the grit number, the finer the abrasive material. For example, a grit of 120 is considered very fine, while a grit of 60 is considered quite coarse. Grit is measured on what is called the “grit scale”, which is a logarithmic scale that measures the size of the particles of the abrasive. The higher the grit number, the smaller the particles.</p>
