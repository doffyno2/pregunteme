<p>Are you having trouble with your Asus laptop preparing automatic repair? If so, you’re not alone. Many users have run into this issue and have been unable to fix it. The good news is that there are ways to get your laptop back up and running. In this article, we’ll discuss the most common causes of this issue and provide some tips on how to fix it.</p>

<h2>What Causes Asus Laptop Preparing Automatic Repair?</h2>

<p>The most common cause of this issue is a faulty hard drive. Your laptop’s hard drive is the main storage device and contains all of your files and settings. If the hard drive has become corrupted or damaged, it can cause the laptop to display the “preparing automatic repair” message.</p>

<p>Another potential cause of this issue is a corrupted system file. System files are responsible for the proper functioning of your laptop. If one of these files has become corrupted, it can cause the laptop to display the “preparing automatic repair” message.</p>

<p>Finally, this issue can be caused by a faulty power supply or battery. If the power supply or battery is not providing enough power to the laptop, it can cause the laptop to display the “preparing automatic repair” message.</p>

<h2>How to Fix Asus Laptop Preparing Automatic Repair?</h2>

<p>The first step to fixing this issue is to diagnose the cause of the problem. If you suspect that the hard drive is the cause of the problem, you should start by running a disk check. This will help to identify any bad sectors or corrupt files on the hard drive. If the disk check finds any errors, you should back up your files and then replace the hard drive.</p>

<p>If the disk check finds no errors, you should then check for any corrupted system files. You can do this by running a System File Checker (SFC) scan from the command line. This will scan your system for any corrupted files and attempt to repair them. If the scan finds any corrupt files, you should back up your files and then run a repair installation of Windows.</p>

<p>Finally, if the disk check and SFC scan both come up clean, you should check the power supply and battery. If either of them is not providing enough power to the laptop, you should replace them with new ones. This should resolve the issue and allow you to boot up your laptop properly.</p>
