The Proposal is a 2009 romantic comedy film starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. In the film, Bullock's character, Margaret Tate, is a Canadian executive who is forced to marry her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Reynolds), in order to stay in the United States. The movie features a number of memorable characters, including Kevin, Margaret's loyal and lovable pooch. So, what kind of dog is Kevin in The Proposal?

<h2>The Bulldog</h2>

Kevin is a Bulldog, a breed of medium-sized, muscular dog with a short, flat muzzle and a sturdy, compact body. Bulldogs are often seen as a symbol of strength and courage, and are known for their even temperaments and loyal personalities. Kevin is no exception, and is as loyal and devoted to Margaret as any canine can be. 

<h2>The History of the Bulldog</h2>

The Bulldog is one of the oldest breeds of dog, having been around since at least the 11th century. The breed was developed in Britain, and was originally used for bull-baiting, a cruel and barbaric sport in which dogs were pitted against bulls in a fight to the death. Fortunately, bull baiting was outlawed in 1835, and the breed was subsequently bred for more pleasant, companion-type roles. 

<h2>The Bulldog in Popular Culture</h2>

Bulldogs have long been a popular figure in popular culture. They are often used as mascots for sports teams, including the University of Georgia Bulldogs and the Yale Bulldogs. They also appear in films, television shows, and cartoons, such as Marmaduke, Scooby-Doo, and, of course, The Proposal.

In The Proposal, Kevin is a Bulldog who is loyal and devoted to Margaret Tate. He is seen throughout the movie, and is even featured prominently in the ending scene. Kevin's presence in the movie is a reminder of the unconditional love and loyalty that dogs can bring to our lives. 

<h2>Caring for a Bulldog</h2>

Bulldogs can make wonderful companions, but they do require special care. They should be given regular exercise, a healthy diet, and plenty of love and attention. It is important to keep an eye on their skin and coat, as Bulldogs can be prone to skin problems. They should also be monitored for signs of respiratory problems, as Bulldogs can suffer from breathing difficulties due to their short muzzles. 

<h2>Are Bulldogs Right for You?</h2>

Bulldogs can make wonderful pets, but they are not for everyone. Those considering a Bulldog should be aware of their special needs and should be prepared to provide the necessary care and attention.
