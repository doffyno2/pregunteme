<p>The story of Anne Frank is well known and widely documented. She was a young Jewish girl who, along with her family, went into hiding in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II. She wrote a diary of her experiences, which was later published as "The Diary of a Young Girl" and has become one of the most widely read books in the world.</p>

<p>Anne Frank and her family were eventually discovered and sent to concentration camps. The family was separated, and Anne and her sister, Margot, were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. From there, they were transported to Bergen-Belsen in Germany.</p>
