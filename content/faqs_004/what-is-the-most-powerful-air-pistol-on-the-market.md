<p>Air pistols, also known as pellet guns, are a type of firearm that is powered by compressed air. They are often used for target practice, plinking, hunting small game, and pest control.

<h2>How Do Air Pistols Work?</h2>

<p>Air pistols use compressed air to launch a small, lightweight projectile, usually a lead pellet or BB.
