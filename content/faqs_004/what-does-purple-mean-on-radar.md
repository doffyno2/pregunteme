When looking at a radar image, it can be confusing to decipher the colors used. One of the colors often used is purple, which can be seen in a variety of different types of weather. What does purple mean on radar? In this article, weâ€™ll discuss what purple means on radar, what types of weather can be seen in purple, and how to read a radar image.

<h2>What Does Purple Mean on Radar?</h2>

The color purple on a radar image indicates the presence of heavy precipitation. This can include rain, hail, or snow. It is important to note that the purple color does not indicate the intensity of the precipitation. The intensity is indicated by the brightness of the color. Generally, the brighter the color, the more intense the precipitation.

<h2>Types of Weather Seen in Purple</h2>

The purple color on a radar image can indicate a variety of different types of weather. These include:

<h3>Severe Thunderstorms</h3>

Severe thunderstorms can be seen in purple on a radar image. These storms are characterized by very strong winds, hail, heavy rain, and lightning. Severe thunderstorms can cause significant damage and should be avoided if possible.

<h3>Winter Storms</h3>

Winter storms are often seen in purple on radar images. These storms can include snow, sleet, freezing rain, and strong winds. Winter storms can be especially dangerous as they can cause widespread power outages, downed trees, and icy roads.

<h3>Tropical Storms</h3>

Tropical storms are often seen in purple on a radar image. These storms are characterized by strong winds, heavy rain, and thunderstorms. Tropical storms can cause significant damage and should be avoided if possible.

<h2>How to Read a Radar Image</h2>

Reading a radar image can be confusing, but it is important to try to understand what the colors mean. In general, the colors used on a radar image indicate the type and intensity of precipitation in the area. The colors are generally divided into two categories: light and moderate precipitation and heavy precipitation. The colors for light and moderate precipitation include green, yellow, and orange. The colors for heavy precipitation include red and purple.

It is important to note that the colors can vary depending on the type of radar used and the type of precipitation. Additionally, the colors do not indicate the intensity of the precipitation. The intensity is indicated by the brightness of the color. Generally, the brighter the color, the more intense the precipitation.
