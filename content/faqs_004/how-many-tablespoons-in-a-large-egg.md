<h2>Does the Size of the Egg Matter?</h2>

<p>When it comes to baking, the size of the egg does matter. The size of the egg affects the ratio of egg to other ingredients in a recipe.

Therefore, it is important to use the right size egg for the recipe you are making.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Eggs Accurately</h2>

<p>In order to measure eggs accurately, use a measuring cup or spoon. If you’re using a measuring cup, fill the cup with cold water and crack the egg into the cup. Make sure that the egg is completely submerged in the water. Then, pour out the egg and water into a bowl and measure the amount of egg that is in the bowl.

<h2>Tips for Baking with Eggs</h2>

<p>When baking with eggs, it is important to remember that eggs act as a binding agent. This means that eggs help to hold all of the other ingredients together.

If you use too few eggs, the ingredients may not bind together properly and your recipe may not turn out as expected.</p>

<h2>Substitutes for Eggs</h2>
