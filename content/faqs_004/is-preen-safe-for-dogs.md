Preen is a pre-emergent weed control product that is commonly used in yards and gardens to keep weeds from growing. But is it safe to use around dogs?

<h2>What is Preen?</h2>

Preen is a pre-emergent weed control product that is designed to prevent weeds from germinating and growing. It is made with a combination of corn gluten meal, iron sulfate, and other chemicals that work together to create an effective barrier against weeds. Preen is available in both granular and liquid formulations, and can be used around plants, trees, and shrubs.

<h2>Preen and Dogs</h2>

When used as directed, Preen is generally considered safe to use around dogs. However, it is important to remember that Preen can be toxic if ingested, so it is important to keep dogs away from the product and ensure that they do not have access to areas that have been treated with Preen. Additionally, it is important to note that Preen can be corrosive to skin and eyes, so it is important to use protective gear such as gloves and safety glasses when applying the product.

<h2>Preen Alternatives for Dogs</h2>

There are a number of alternatives to Preen that can be used to control weeds in yards and gardens. These alternatives are generally safer for dogs, as they do not contain the same chemicals as Preen and are not as likely to cause irritation or toxicity if ingested. Some of these alternatives include organic weed killers such as vinegar, corn gluten meal, and citrus oil, as well as mechanical methods such as hand-weeding and solarizing.

<h2>How to Protect Dogs from Preen</h2>

The best way to protect dogs from Preen is to keep them away from areas that have been treated with the product. It is also important to cover treated areas with a tarp to prevent dogs from accessing them. Additionally, it is important to store Preen in a secure location that is inaccessible to pets.

<h2>What to Do if a Dog Ingests Preen</h2>

If a dog has ingested Preen, it is important to seek veterinary care immediately.
