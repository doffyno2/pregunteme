When the temperature rises above 80 degrees, it can be difficult to look fashionable while also staying comfortable. As the summer months approach, it's important to know how to dress in the heat. This article will provide tips on how to dress in 80 degree weather so you can look stylish and stay cool.

<h2>Mind Your Fabrics</h2>

When it comes to dressing in hot and humid weather, fabrics are your best friends. Natural fabrics such as cotton and linen are lightweight and breathable, and will help keep you cool. Avoid synthetic fabrics such as nylon and polyester which can trap heat and make you sweat. In addition, lightweight fabrics like chiffon and gauze are perfect for summery looks.

<h2>Choose the Right Colors</h2>

Light colors are best for hot weather. White, beige, and pastel shades are all great options. Dark colors like black, navy, and brown absorb more heat and can make you feel even hotter. If you do choose to wear darker colors, opt for lightweight fabrics and incorporate lighter colors as accents. 

<h2>Layer Lightly</h2>

Layering is a great way to add style to your look, but it can also be a great way to stay cool. Choose lightweight and breathable fabrics and layer pieces that you can easily remove if you get too warm. For example, wear a light cardigan over a sleeveless top or a linen blazer over a tank top. 

<h2>Opt for Loose Fits</h2>

When dressing in 80 degree weather, it’s best to go for loose fits. Tight fitting clothes can trap heat and make you feel even hotter. Choose clothes with a relaxed fit and avoid anything too clingy or body-hugging. 

<h2>Protect Your Skin</h2>

It’s important to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful rays when the weather is hot. Wear light long-sleeved clothing and opt for wide-brimmed hats and sunglasses. In addition, use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 to protect your skin from UV rays. 

<h2>Go for Open-Toed Shoes</h2>

When it’s hot outside, your feet will thank you for wearing open-toed shoes. Sandals, flip flops, and espadrilles are all great options. If you do choose to wear closed-toed shoes, opt for lightweight materials like canvas or leather.
