<h2>What Is Trazadone?</h2>

<p>Trazadone is a prescription medication used to treat a variety of canine conditions, including anxiety, aggression, and phobias.

<h2>How Long Does It Take for Trazadone to Wear Off?</h2>

<p>Trazadone typically has a half-life of between four and six hours, which means that it takes approximately six hours for half of the drug to be metabolized and leave the pet's body. However, the exact time it takes for the drug to wear off will depend on the size of the dog, the dose given, and how quickly the dog's body metabolizes the drug. It is important to note that some dogs may take longer for the drug to wear off than others.</p>
