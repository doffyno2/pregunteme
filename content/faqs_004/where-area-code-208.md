It encompasses the majority of the state, with the exception of a few counties in the far southeastern corner that are served by area codes 406 and 406.</p>

<p>The area code 208 is the main geographic area for the state of Idaho, encompassing the cities of Boise, Idaho Falls, Pocatello, and Twin Falls.

<h2>History of Area Code 208</h2>

<p>Area code 208 was established in 1953 as one of the original area codes in the NANP. At the time, it covered the entire state of Idaho, as well as parts of Oregon, Montana, and Wyoming. Over the years, as the population of Idaho grew, the need for additional area codes arose. In 1997, area code 406 was established to cover the southeastern corner of the state, and in 1999, area code 986 was created to cover the northeastern corner of the state.</p>

<p>In 2008, area code 986 was split, creating area code 775. This was done in response to the increasing demand for phone numbers in the area. In 2019, area code 986 was again split, creating area code 583, to serve the northeastern corner of the state.</p>
