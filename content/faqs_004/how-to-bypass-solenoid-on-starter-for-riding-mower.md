<p>Riding mower starters include a solenoid that closes a circuit between the starter motor and the battery when you turn the ignition key. The solenoid is a large electric switch, and it can fail due to dirt, corrosion or wear. If the solenoid fails, you can bypass it to get the riding mower running. This is a relatively easy task that requires only a few basic tools. </p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pliers</li>
  <li>Wire cutters</li>
  <li>Wire strippers</li>
  <li>Electrical tape</li>
  <li>2 pieces of 16-gauge insulated wire</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Disconnect the negative (black) battery cable from the battery.</li>
  <li>Remove the starter from the engine by unbolting it from the engine block.</li>
  <li>Locate the solenoid wiring terminals on the starter motor. The solenoid has two posts and two wires connected to the posts.</li>
  <li>Cut the two wires connected to the solenoid posts with the wire cutters.</li>
  <li>Strip 1/2 inch of insulation from each end of the two pieces of 16-gauge insulated wire.</li>
  <li>Wrap one end of one of the pieces of wire around one of the solenoid posts, and secure it with a pair of pliers.</li>
  <li>Wrap the other end of the wire around the other solenoid post, and secure it with a pair of pliers.</li>
  <li>Wrap the other piece of wire around the other solenoid post, and secure it with a pair of pliers.</li>
  <li>Wrap the other end of the wire around the other solenoid post, and secure it with a pair of pliers.</li>
  <li>Wrap electrical tape around the ends of the wires to ensure a good electrical connection.</li>
  <li>Reconnect the negative (black) battery cable to the battery.</li>
  <li>Install the starter back onto the engine block and tighten the bolts to secure it.</li>
  <li>Turn the ignition key to start the engine.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips and Warnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure to wear protective glasses when working with the starter motor.</li>
  <li>Be sure to wear protective gloves when handling the starter motor.</li>
  <li>Be sure to disconnect the negative (black) battery cable before working with the starter motor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4>Q: What is a solenoid?</h4>
<p>A: A solenoid is an electric switch that is used to close a circuit between the starter motor and the battery when the ignition key is turned.</p>

<h4>Q: What tools are needed to bypass a solenoid?</h4>
<p>A: To bypass a solenoid, you will need pliers, wire cutters, wire strippers, electrical tape, and two pieces of 16-gauge insulated wire.</p>

<h4>Q: What are the steps for bypassing a solenoid?</h4>
<p>A: The steps for bypassing a solenoid are: 1) disconnect the negative (black) battery cable from the battery; 2) remove the starter from the engine; 3) locate the solenoid wiring terminals on the starter motor; 4) cut the two wires connected to the solenoid posts; 5) strip 1/2 inch of insulation from each end of the two pieces of 16-gauge insulated wire; 6) wrap one end of one of the pieces of wire around one of the solenoid posts; 7) wrap the other end of the wire around the other solenoid post; 8) wrap the other piece of wire around the other solenoid post; 9) wrap the other end of the wire around the other solenoid post; 10) wrap electrical tape around the ends of the wires; 11) reconnect the negative (black) battery cable to the battery; 12) install the starter back onto the engine block; 13) tighten the bolts to secure it; and 14) turn the ignition key to start the engine.</p>

<h4>Q: What safety precautions should be taken when bypassing a solenoid?</h4>
<p>A: When bypassing a solenoid, it is important to wear protective glasses and gloves and to disconnect the negative (black) battery cable before working with the starter motor.</p>

<h4>Q: What type of wire is used to bypass a solenoid?</h4>
<p>A: To bypass a solenoid, you will need two pieces of 16-gauge insulated wire.</p>

<h4>Q: What is the purpose of bypassing a solenoid?</h4>
<p>A: The purpose of bypassing a solenoid is to get a riding mower running if the solenoid has failed due to dirt, corrosion or wear.</p>

<h4>Q: How do you install the starter back onto the engine block?</h4>
<p>A: To install the starter back onto the engine block, you will need to bolt it into place and tighten the bolts to secure it.</p>

<h4>Q: What is the first step for bypassing a solenoid?</h4>
<p>A: The first step for bypassing a solenoid is to disconnect the negative (black) battery cable from the battery.</p>

<h4>Q: How do you wrap electrical tape around the ends of the wires?</h4>
<p>A: To wrap electrical tape around the ends of the wires, simply wrap the tape around each end to ensure a good electrical connection.</p>

<h4>Q: How do you locate the solenoid wiring terminals on the starter motor?</h4>
<p>A: To locate the solenoid wiring terminals on the starter motor, look for the two posts and two wires connected to the posts.</p>

<h4>Q: How do you secure the wires with a pair of pliers?</h4>
<p>A: To secure the wires with a pair of pliers, wrap the wire around the post and then hold it tightly with the pliers.</p>

<h4>Q: How do you strip 1/2 inch of insulation from each end of the two pieces of 16-gauge insulated wire?</h4>
<p>A: To strip 1/2 inch of insulation from each end of the two pieces of 16-gauge insulated wire, use a pair of wire strippers to remove the insulation from the ends of the wire.</p>

<h4>Q: How do you cut the two wires connected to the solenoid posts?</h4>
<p>A: To cut the two wires connected to the solenoid posts, use a pair of wire cutters to cut the wires.</p>

<h4>Q: What type of tools are needed to remove the starter from the engine?</h4>
<p>A: To remove the starter from the engine, you will need a wrench or socket set to unbolt the starter from the engine block.</p>
