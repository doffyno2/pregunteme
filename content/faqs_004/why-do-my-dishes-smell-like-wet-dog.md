<p>In addition to keeping dishes clean, it’s important to make sure they’re stored properly. Don’t leave dishes in the sink or on the counter for extended periods of time, as this can encourage bacteria growth. Instead, store them in a dry, airtight container or cupboard. </p>

<p>Finally, make sure to use a good dishwashing detergent that is designed to fight odors. Look for formulas that contain natural ingredients such as baking soda, vinegar, and lemon juice, as these can help to neutralize odors and keep dishes smelling fresh. </p>

<h2>What to Do If Dishes Still Smell Like Wet Dog </h2>
