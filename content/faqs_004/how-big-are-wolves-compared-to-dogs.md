<p>Wolves and dogs belong to the same family, Canidae. However, they are two very different animals. Wolves are much larger than dogs, with males typically weighing between 40 and 175 pounds (18 and 79 kg). By comparison, the average adult dog weighs between 25 and 40 pounds (11 and 18 kg). Wolves also have longer legs, broader chests, and much larger heads than dogs. Their fur is usually gray or brown, but can range from white to black. Wolves have a strong sense of territory and will fiercely defend their den or home against intruders.</p>

<p>Wolves are also much more aggressive than dogs. They are powerful hunters and have been known to kill large animals such as deer, elk, and moose. Wolves also tend to live in packs of four to eight individuals, and they cooperate to hunt, defend their territory, and raise their young. Dogs, on the other hand, are usually loyal to their owners and are friendly with strangers. They also tend to live in smaller groups and are not as territorial as wolves.</p>
