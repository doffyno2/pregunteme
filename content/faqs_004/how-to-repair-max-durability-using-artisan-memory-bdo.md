<h2>What is Artisan Memory and How is it Used? </h2>

Artisan Memory is a powerful crafting tool for Black Desert Online (BDO). It allows players to take part in a variety of crafting activities, such as gathering, processing, and trading. In order to use Artisan Memory, players must first obtain a special item called “Memory Fragment”. Memory Fragments can be obtained through various means, including completing quests, participating in challenging activities, and more. 

Once a Memory Fragment has been obtained, players can use it to create an “Artisan Memory”. Artisan Memory works in much the same way as a normal Memory Fragment, with the added benefit of being able to store crafting recipes and materials. This makes it much easier for players to craft items, as they can access all the necessary information in one place. 

<h2>How to Repair Max Durability Using Artisan Memory BDO</h2>

In BDO, items can be damaged over time due to use. When an item reaches 0 durability, it will be unusable until it is repaired. Fortunately, Artisan Memory makes it easy for players to repair their items. All they need to do is follow the steps below:
