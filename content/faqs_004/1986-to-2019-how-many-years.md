<p>It's hard to believe but 2019 marks 33 years since 1986 - a year that saw the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, the Chernobyl disaster, and the launch of the first global satellite navigation system, the Global Positioning System (GPS). It's been a long, eventful journey since then, and today we take a look back at some of the defining moments of the past 33 years.</p>

<h2>The Fall of the Berlin Wall</h2>

<p>One of the most iconic events of the past 33 years was the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The wall, which had divided the city since 1961, was finally breached after months of protests and unrest. The fall of the wall symbolized the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany.</p>

<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>

<p>In 1989, the world wide web was born when British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee developed the first web browser. The web revolutionized the way people communicate, learn, and do business, and it has since grown to become one of the most important tools of our day.</p>

<h2>The Dot-Com Boom</h2>

<p>One of the most significant events of the past 33 years was the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Companies such as Amazon, Google, and eBay were founded during this time and quickly grew to become some of the most influential companies in the world. The dot-com boom also gave rise to a new wave of entrepreneurs who are now some of the most successful businesspeople in the world.</p>

<h2>9/11 and the War on Terror</h2>

<p>September 11th 2001 will forever be remembered as one of the darkest days in modern history. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon marked the beginning of the War on Terror, a conflict which continues to this day. The events of 9/11 also changed the way we view security and terrorism, and many security measures have been implemented in recent years in an attempt to prevent similar attacks.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Social Media</h2>

<p>Social media has become an integral part of modern life in the past decade. Sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have changed the way we communicate and interact with one another. They have also enabled individuals to become influencers and have a direct impact on the world around them.</p>

<h2>The Introduction of Smartphones</h2>

<p>In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, which revolutionized the way we use technology. The introduction of smartphones made it easier for people to access the internet and stay connected with one another. Smartphones have since become ubiquitous, and they continue to shape the way we interact with the world around us.</p>

<h2>The Global Financial Crisis</h2>

<p>In 2008, the global financial crisis shook the world. The crisis, which was caused by the collapse of the US housing market, had a devastating impact on the global economy. Many countries were forced to implement austerity measures in an attempt to stabilize their economies, and the crisis is still having an impact on the world today.</p>

<h2>The Arab Spring</h2>

<p>In 2011, a wave of protests swept across the Middle East and North Africa in what became known as the Arab Spring. The protests, which were sparked by a desire for greater democracy, resulted in the overthrow of several long-standing dictatorships, although some of these countries have since descended into chaos.</p>

<h2>The Rise of China</h2>

<p>China has become one of the world's largest economies in the past 33 years. Its economy is now the second-largest in the world, and it is home to many of the world's leading companies. China is also becoming increasingly influential on the world stage, and its rise is likely to have a profound effect on the global economy in the coming years.</p>

<h2>Brexit</h2>

<p>In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a historic referendum. The decision to leave has had far-reaching implications for the UK and the EU, and it is still unclear what the long-term effects will be. Brexit has sparked intense debate both within the UK and across Europe, and it is likely to remain a prominent issue for years to come.</p>
