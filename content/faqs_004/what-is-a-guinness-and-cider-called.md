<p>When it comes to popular drinks, few beverages can compete with the classic combination of Guinness and cider. This iconic combination of beer and cider has been a favorite of drinkers for decades, and is often referred to by its own name. But what is a Guinness and cider called?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is actually quite simple. The classic combination of Guinness and cider is known as a "Black and Tan". This term comes from the fact that both beverages are dark in color, creating a two-tone look when poured side-by-side. The Guinness is generally poured first, with the cider being poured on top of it. This creates a unique visual effect, with the darker Guinness creating a "black" layer on the bottom, and the lighter cider creating a "tan" layer on top. </p>

<p>The "Black and Tan" name has been around since at least the early 1900s, when it was popular among Irish immigrants in the United States. Since then, the drink has become increasingly popular and is now a staple of many pubs and bars around the world. </p>

<p>When making a Black and Tan, it is important to pour the Guinness first. This is because Guinness has a higher density than the cider, so it will settle at the bottom of the glass. If the cider is poured first, it will simply float on top of the Guinness and not create the desired effect. </p>

<h2>How to Make a Guinness and Cider</h2>

<p>Making a Guinness and cider is actually quite simple. All you need is a glass, a bottle of Guinness, a bottle of cider, and a bar spoon. First, fill the glass about three-quarters of the way with the Guinness. Then, hold the bar spoon upside-down over the Guinness and slowly pour the cider over the spoon, allowing it to settle on top of the Guinness. This will create the desired two-tone effect. </p>

<p>Once you have poured the cider, you can enjoy your Black and Tan. It is important to drink it quickly, as the two layers will mix over time. This will still create a tasty beverage, but it will not have the same visual impact. </p>

<h2>Other Popular Variations</h2>

<p>While the classic Black and Tan is made with Guinness and cider, there are several other variations that are popular around the world. In Ireland, for example, a "Half and Half" is popular. This is made with equal parts of Guinness and Smithwicks Ale. In other parts of the world, a "Half and Half" is also made with Guinness and lager. </p>

<p>In the United States, a "Black Velvet" is popular. This is made with Guinness and champagne or sparkling wine. The drink is made by filling a glass with half Guinness and half sparkling wine, creating a unique taste and visual effect. </p>
