Cliffhanger is a classic 1993 American action-adventure film starring Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow and Michael Rooker. It was directed by Renny Harlin, produced by Alan Marshall and written by Michael France and Sylvester Stallone. The film follows the story of a former mountain climber, Gabe Walker (Stallone), who is pulled back into the world of mountain climbing and rescues after a group of criminals hijack a plane carrying $100 million of US Treasury bearer bonds.

The film was shot on location in the Italian Alps in the Aosta Valley and the Dolomite Mountains. Filming took place over a period of seven months, from February to September in 1992. The crew had to brave inclement weather and treacherous terrain in order to complete the film. 

<h2>The Aosta Valley</h2>

The Aosta Valley is a mountainous region in northern Italy that borders France, Switzerland, and Austria. It is home to some of the highest peaks in Europe, including Monte Rosa, the Matterhorn, and Gran Paradiso. The region is known for its spectacular scenery and pristine Alpine forests. 

The Aosta Valley was the primary filming location for Cliffhanger. It was chosen for its beautiful landscapes and rugged terrain, which were perfect for the action scenes in the film. Several scenes were shot in the valleys of La Thuile and Gressoney, as well as the Gran Paradiso National Park. The crew also filmed in the nearby town of Courmayeur and the Pila ski resort. 

<h2>The Dolomite Mountains</h2>

The Dolomite Mountains are a mountain range in the northern Italian Alps. They are renowned for their stunning beauty and jagged peaks. The range is home to some of the most stunning alpine scenery in Europe, making it an ideal location for film shoots. 

The crew also filmed several scenes in the Dolomite Mountains. These scenes were mostly shot at the Marmolada Glacier and the Cinque Torri (Five Towers) area. These locations provided the perfect backdrop for some of the film's most thrilling action sequences. 

<h2>The Final Scene</h2>

The final scene of the movie was shot on the Salbit Bridge in Switzerland. This scene was the most difficult to shoot due to the fact that the bridge is only wide enough for two people to stand side by side. The crew had to build a special platform that extended into the air to make the scene possible.
