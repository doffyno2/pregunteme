<p>DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is a program that allows certain undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation. DACA also enables these individuals to obtain a work permit and apply for certain benefits such as a driver's license or a social security number. Currently, the DACA program is in limbo as the future of the program is uncertain under the current administration.</p>

<p>Many DACA recipients are curious to know if they are able to travel to Hawaii under the program. The answer is that it is possible for DACA recipients to travel to the state of Hawaii, however, there are certain restrictions that must be taken into consideration before planning a trip.</p>

<h2>Travel Requirements for DACA Recipients</h2>

<p>DACA recipients are allowed to travel within the US as long as they meet certain criteria. First, the DACA recipient must be able to show proof of their DACA status. This can be done by presenting a valid Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Second, the DACA recipient must have advanced parole from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Advanced parole is an authorization from USCIS that allows a DACA recipient to travel outside the US for a specific purpose and then return to the US. In order for a DACA recipient to travel to Hawaii, they must obtain advanced parole from USCIS.</p>

<p>It is important to note that advanced parole is not automatically granted to DACA recipients. A DACA recipient must submit an application to USCIS and must provide detailed information about the purpose of their travel. Generally, USCIS will only grant advanced parole if the DACA recipient can demonstrate a “compelling humanitarian reason” or a “significant public benefit” for their travel.</p>

<p>Once a DACA recipient has obtained advanced parole, they must also obtain a valid passport or other travel document that is accepted by the US government. The passport or travel document must be valid for the entire duration of the trip. It is also important to note that travel documents for DACA recipients may only be used for travel to the US and not for travel to any other countries. Finally, DACA recipients should make sure to have a valid return ticket when traveling to Hawaii.</p>

<h2>Risks of Traveling to Hawaii</h2>

<p>While traveling to Hawaii is possible for DACA recipients, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with such a trip. If a DACA recipient is stopped by immigration authorities while traveling to Hawaii, it is possible that they may be detained and/or deported. It is also important to note that leaving the US for any length of time may have an impact on their DACA status and could put them at risk for losing their authorization. Therefore, it is important for DACA recipients to consult with an immigration attorney before taking any trips outside the US.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

DACA recipients must obtain advanced parole from USCIS and must have a valid passport or other travel document accepted by the US government.
