<p>If you're having trouble with your Craftsman riding lawnmower not turning over, you're not alone. This is a common issue that many homeowners face, but thankfully it can usually be resolved with a few troubleshooting steps. In this article, we'll show you how to troubleshoot a Craftsman riding lawnmower that won't turn over and get it running again in no time.</p>

<h2>Check the Battery</h2>
<p>The first thing you should do when troubleshooting a Craftsman riding lawnmower that won't turn over is to check the battery. Make sure that the battery is fully charged, and if it isn't, you'll need to charge it using an external charger. If the battery appears to be fine but still won't turn over, you'll need to check the cables and connections to make sure that everything is properly connected.</p>

<h2>Check the Spark Plug</h2>
<p>The spark plug is an essential component of the ignition system and is responsible for igniting the fuel in the engine. If it is faulty or dirty, then the mower won't be able to turn over. Inspect the spark plug and make sure that it is clean and in good condition. If it looks damaged, then you'll need to replace it before trying to start the mower again.</p>

<h2>Check the Fuel Supply</h2>
<p>Another potential cause of a Craftsman riding lawnmower not turning over is a lack of fuel. Make sure that the fuel tank is full and that there is no debris or dirt blocking the fuel line. You may also need to check the fuel filter and replace it if it is dirty or clogged.</p>

<h2>Check the Ignition Switch</h2>
<p>Finally, you should check the ignition switch to make sure that it is properly adjusted. If it is not adjusted properly, it can prevent the mower from turning over. To adjust the switch, you'll need to unscrew the screws that hold it in place and move it to the correct position. Once you have adjusted the switch, try starting the mower again.</p>
