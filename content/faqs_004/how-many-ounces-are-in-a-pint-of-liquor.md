Most people are familiar with the size of a pint when it comes to beer and other beverages, but when it comes to spirits, the measurements can be a bit confusing. A pint is commonly used to measure the amount of liquor in a bottle or glass, but how many ounces are in a pint of liquor? 

<h2>Understanding Measurements of Alcohol</h2>

The measurement of alcohol is important in many aspects of the industry, including pricing and taxation. Knowing the exact amount of alcohol in a bottle can help you save money as well as ensure you are drinking in moderation.

<h2>How Much Alcohol Is in a Pint?</h2>

A pint of liquor is equal to 16 ounces or two cups. This means that a pint of 80-proof liquor contains 8 ounces of alcohol, or 8 shots of one ounce each. This is equivalent to four double shots of liquor, or two large drinks. A pint of higher-proof liquor such as a 100-proof whiskey contains 10 ounces of alcohol, or 10 shots of one ounce each. 

<h2>How Much Is in a Standard Serving of Alcohol?</h2>

A standard serving of alcohol is equal to one ounce or one shot. This means that a pint of 80-proof liquor contains 16 standard servings and a pint of 100-proof liquor contains 20 standard servings. Knowing how many ounces are in a pint of liquor can help you determine how many drinks you are consuming and help you stay in control.
