Have you ever noticed your dog’s lip quivering? It can be quite alarming to witness, as you may fear something is wrong with your pup. But the good news is, lip quivering in dogs is usually a sign of excitement, not illness or pain.

<h2>What Does Lip Quivering in Dogs Look Like? </h2>

When a dog’s lip quivers, they will usually pull back the corner of their mouth, making their lip look almost like it is shaking. It often happens when they are very excited, such as when they are happy to see you, or when they are anticipating the arrival of something they love, such as food or a toy. Lip quivering can also happen when dogs are anxious or stressed.
