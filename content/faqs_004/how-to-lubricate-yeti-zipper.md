<p>Are you having trouble opening and closing your Yeti zipper? Zippers can often get stuck due to lack of lubrication or because of dirt and grime that can build up and make it hard to move. Fortunately, there are easy and effective ways to lubricate your Yeti zipper, no matter what type of zipper it is.</p>

<h2>What You Need to Lubricate a Yeti Zipper</h2>

<p>In order to lubricate your Yeti zipper, you will need a few simple tools. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lubricant – this can be any type of lubricant, such as WD-40, silicone spray, or a graphite-based lubricant.</li>
<li>A cloth – this can be a soft cloth, such as a microfiber cloth, or an old t-shirt.</li>
<li>A toothpick or small brush – this will help to remove any dirt or debris that is stuck in the zipper.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Lubricate a Yeti Zipper</h2>

<p>The first step in lubricating a Yeti zipper is to use the toothpick or brush to remove any dirt or debris that is stuck in the zipper teeth. Make sure to be gentle and not to force the zipper open or closed. Once the dirt has been removed, it’s time to move on to the next step. </p>

<p>The next step is to apply the lubricant. You can use a spray lubricant, such as WD-40, or you can use a graphite-based lubricant. If you are using a spray lubricant, make sure to spray it directly onto the zipper teeth and not onto the fabric of the Yeti. If you are using a graphite-based lubricant, use a cloth to apply it to the zipper teeth. </p>

<p>Once the lubricant has been applied, it’s time to test the zipper. Open and close the zipper a few times and make sure that it is moving smoothly. If there is still resistance, you may need to add a bit more lubricant. </p>

<p>Finally, you should wipe away any excess lubricant with a cloth. This will help to prevent any grease or lubricant from getting onto the fabric of the Yeti and causing a stain. </p>
