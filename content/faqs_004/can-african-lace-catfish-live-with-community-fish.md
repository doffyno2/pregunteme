<p>African lace catfish are a popular choice for aquariums due to their unique patterned scales, which give them a lace-like appearance. They are also renowned for their peaceful nature, making them a great choice for community tanks. But is it safe for African lace catfish to live with other fish?</p>

<p>The answer is yes! African lace catfish are generally peaceful and gentle, so they can make great additions to a community tank. They are also very hardy and can tolerate a wide range of water conditions, which makes them a great choice for aquariums with other species of fish. However, there are some things to consider before adding African lace catfish to your aquarium.</p>

<h2>Things To Consider When Adding African Lace Catfish To A Community Tank</h2>

<p>When adding African lace catfish to a community tank, it is important to remember that they can grow quite large. Depending on the species, they can reach up to 10 inches in length. This means that they need plenty of space to move around and should not be added to a tank that is too small. It is also important to ensure that the tank has plenty of hiding places and places for the catfish to retreat to if they become stressed.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that African lace catfish are generally bottom feeders, so it is best to only add them to a tank that has other bottom-dwelling fish. This will help to ensure that the catfish get enough food, as they may not be able to compete with fish that feed higher up in the water column.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to ensure that the water conditions in the tank are suitable for African lace catfish. They prefer water temperatures of 72-82째F (22-27째C), a pH of 6.5-7.5, and a hardness of 6-15 dGH. It is also important to make sure that the water is well-oxygenated, as African lace catfish require plenty of oxygen in order to remain healthy.</p>

<h2>Compatible Tank Mates For African Lace Catfish</h2>

<p>African lace catfish make great additions to community tanks, as they are generally peaceful and can live peacefully alongside other species of fish. However, it is important to research the fish you intend to add to your tank, as some species may be too aggressive for the catfish to live with. Some compatible tank mates for African lace catfish include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guppies</li>
  <li>Platies</li>
  <li>Mollies</li>
  <li>Corydoras Catfish</li>
  <li>Tetras</li>
  <li>Danios</li>
  <li>Barbs</li>
  <li>Rainbowfish</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to remember that African lace catfish are timid, so it is best to avoid adding any fish that are known to be particularly aggressive. Additionally, it is best to avoid adding any fish that have a similar diet to the catfish, as this could lead to competition for food.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>African lace catfish can make great additions to community tanks, as they are generally peaceful and can live peacefully alongside other species of fish. However, it is important to ensure that the tank is large enough to accommodate the catfish, and that the water parameters are suitable for them. Additionally, it is important to research any potential tank mates before adding them to the tank, as some species may be too aggressive for the catfish to live with. With the right care and tank mates, African lace catfish can make a great addition to any community tank.</p>
