<h2>What is Heartgard?</h2>

Heartgard is a medication that is used to prevent heartworm infection in dogs. It is a monthly chewable tablet that contains an active ingredient called ivermectin, which is an anti-parasitic medication. The medication helps to kill any larval stages of the heartworm that may be present in the dog's bloodstream, preventing them from maturing into adult worms and causing a heartworm infection.

<h2>How Does Heartgard Work?</h2>

Heartgard works by killing the larval stages of the heartworm before they have a chance to mature into adult worms. This prevents them from being able to reproduce and cause an infection. The medication is designed to be given once a month, and should be given on the same day each month to ensure maximum effectiveness.
