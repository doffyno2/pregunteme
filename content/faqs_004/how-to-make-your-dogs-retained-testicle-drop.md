<p>Many pet owners are unaware that some male dogs can suffer from a condition known as ‘retained testicles’. This is where one or both of the testicles fail to descend into the scrotum and instead remain inside the abdomen. It is a common problem in some breeds of dog and, if left untreated, can lead to a number of health problems. Fortunately, there are a number of treatments available to help make your dog’s retained testicle drop.</p>

<h2>What Causes Retained Testicles?</h2>

<p>Retained testicles are caused by a number of different factors. In some cases, it is due to a congenital defect, where the testicles simply fail to descend properly. In other cases, it can be caused by an infection or a trauma, such as a kick to the abdomen. In some cases, the cause is unknown.</p>

<h2>Signs and Symptoms of Retained Testicles</h2>

<p>The most common sign of retained testicles is a swelling in the abdomen. This is usually located just below the ribcage. If you notice this, then it is important to take your dog to the vet for a diagnosis. Other signs and symptoms include difficulty urinating, pain or discomfort in the abdomen, and a decrease in fertility.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing Retained Testicles</h2>

<p>If your vet suspects that your dog is suffering from retained testicles, they will carry out a physical examination. This will involve palpating the abdomen to feel for any swellings. They may also use an ultrasound or X-ray to get a better view of the testicles. If the testicles are still in the abdomen, then your vet will be able to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Treatments for Retained Testicles</h2>

<p>The most common treatment for retained testicles is surgery. This involves making a small incision in the abdomen and then manually pushing the testicle down into the scrotum. It is usually a relatively straightforward procedure and most dogs make a full recovery within a few weeks. However, it is important to note that surgery does carry some risks and should only be carried out by a qualified vet.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Surgery</h2>

<p>If your vet does not recommend surgery, there are some alternative treatments available. These include hormone therapy and medication, which are designed to stimulate the testicles to drop. However, these treatments are not always successful and, if they do not work, then surgery may be necessary.</p>

<h2>Preventing Retained Testicles</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent retained testicles is to ensure that your dog is neutered at the appropriate age. Neutering is a simple, safe procedure which can help to prevent a number of health problems. It is also important to keep your dog away from sources of trauma, such as kicks or falls, which can cause the testicles to remain in the abdomen.</p>
