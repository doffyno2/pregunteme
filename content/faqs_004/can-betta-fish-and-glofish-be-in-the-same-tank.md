In recent years, the popularity of aquarists has grown immensely. People are now looking for the perfect combination of fish to add to their tanks, to create a stunning and unique display. One of the most popular questions asked is whether betta fish and glofish can be in the same tank.

<h2>Betta Fish</h2>

Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are a type of freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia. They are one of the most popular aquarium fish, due to their vibrant colors and attractive fins. Bettas are aggressive by nature and typically do not get along with other fish in the same tank.
