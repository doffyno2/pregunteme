<p>Tenting a turkey with foil is a great way to create delicious, juicy turkey that is perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Foil tenting is a method of cooking that uses a combination of baking and steaming to create the perfect turkey. By tenting your turkey with foil, you will ensure that it is cooked evenly and won't dry out while it's baking. In this article, we'll explain how to foil tent a turkey and provide some helpful tips for ensuring that it comes out perfectly every time. </p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<p>Before you can foil tent your turkey, you'll need to gather a few supplies. You'll need a large roasting pan, aluminum foil, butter, and some seasonings. You'll also need a thermometer to make sure that your turkey is cooked to the proper temperature. </p>

<h2>Steps for Foil Tenting a Turkey</h2>

<p>Once you have all of your supplies, you're ready to begin. Here are the steps you'll need to take:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>

<p>Before you begin, preheat your oven to 350°F. This is the temperature that you'll need to cook the turkey.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Preparing the Turkey</h3>

<p>Next, take your turkey and prepare it for cooking. Remove the neck and giblets, and pat the turkey dry with a paper towel. Rub the turkey all over with butter, then season it with salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you prefer. Place the turkey in the roasting pan.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cover With Foil</h3>

<p>Now it's time to cover the turkey with foil. Take a large sheet of aluminum foil and lay it over the turkey. Make sure that the foil is covering the entire turkey, and that the edges of the foil are tucked underneath the turkey. This will help to create a seal that will keep the steam in and ensure that the turkey is cooked evenly.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Turkey</h3>

<p>Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and bake the turkey for the recommended amount of time. You can use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the turkey and make sure that it is cooked to the proper temperature. Once the turkey is done, remove it from the oven and carefully remove the foil.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Let the Turkey Rest</h3>

<p>Once the turkey is done cooking, let it rest for at least 15 minutes before carving. This will ensure that the juices are redistributed throughout the turkey, resulting in a juicy, flavorful turkey.</p>
