<p>Sneezing, or sternutation, is an involuntary reflex action triggered by the body to expel irritants from the nose. It is an important bodily function that helps keep the nose and airways clear of dust, pollen, and other airborne particles. But what happens if you suddenly find yourself unable to sneeze?</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why you might have suddenly stopped being able to sneeze. It could be due to a physical or psychological cause, or a combination of both. In this article, we'll look at the different possible causes of why you can't sneeze anymore and what you can do about it.</p>
