<h2>What is a Traveling Broadway Actor?</h2>

<p>A traveling Broadway actor is someone who performs in professional theater productions on the road. This is different from a traditional Broadway actor, who performs in a single production for a set number of shows in one location. Traveling Broadway actors take a show on the road and can perform it in multiple cities, often over the course of several months. The show usually travels with a cast and crew of people who work together to make the production a success.</p>
