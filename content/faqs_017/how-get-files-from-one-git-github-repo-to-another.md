<p>Git and Github are popular version control and collaboration tools used by software developers. They are used to store and share code, track changes, and collaborate with other developers. In some cases, it may be necessary to get files from one Git Github repo to another. In this article, we will discuss how to do this.</p>

<h2>What is Git?</h2>

<p>Git is a distributed version control system. It is used to track changes in source code and collaborate with other developers. It allows developers to store their code in a central repository, track changes, and collaborate with other developers. It is the most popular version control system in the world.</p>

<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>

<p>GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It allows developers to store their code in a central repository, track changes, and collaborate with other developers. It is the most popular web-based hosting service for Git repositories.</p>

<h2>How to Get Files from One Git GitHub Repo to Another</h2>

<p>In order to get files from one Git GitHub repo to another, you need to use the Git command line. Git allows you to clone a repository from one location to another. To do this, you need to use the “git clone” command. You can specify the source repository and the destination repository when you use this command.</p>

<p>Once you have cloned the repository, you can then copy the files from one repository to another. To do this, you need to use the “git mv” command. This command allows you to move files from one repository to another. You can specify the source repository and the destination repository when you use this command.</p>

<p>Once you have moved the files from one repository to another, you can then commit the changes to the destination repository. To do this, you need to use the “git commit” command. This command allows you to commit changes to the destination repository. You can specify the source repository and the destination repository when you use this command.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Git and GitHub are powerful tools that allow developers to store and share code, track changes, and collaborate with other developers. It is possible to get files from one Git GitHub repo to another using the Git command line. To do this, you need to use the “git clone” and “git mv” commands. Once you have moved the files from one repository to another, you can then commit the changes to the destination repository using the “git commit” command.</p>
