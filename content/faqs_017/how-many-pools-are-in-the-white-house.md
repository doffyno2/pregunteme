<h1>How Many Pools Are in the White House?<h1>

The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800. The White House is a symbol of the nation and of the Presidentâ€™s leadership. Over the years, various renovations and additions have been made to the White House and the grounds, including the addition of several pools.

<h2>The White House Pools</h2>

The White House has two outdoor pools. One is a traditional rectangular pool located on the South Lawn, adjacent to the White House. The second pool, which is located on the North Lawn, is a more natural-looking, kidney-shaped pool. Both pools are surrounded by lush gardens and lawns and are used for leisure and exercise by the President and his family.

The South Lawn pool is the larger of the two and is often used for swimming competitions and other events. The pool was built in 1975 and is the only one of the two pools to be heated. It measures 20 feet wide by 40 feet long and is four feet deep.

The North Lawn pool is smaller than the South Lawn pool, measuring 20 feet wide by 25 feet long and is three feet deep. The pool was built in 1988 and is used primarily by President George H.W. Bush and his family.
