<p>When it comes to delicious, juicy burgers, nothing beats a grilled burger. But what about the calories? Are grilled burgers really as healthy as they seem?</p>

<p>Calories in a grilled burger depend on what kind of burger you get. A single-patty burger without any condiments or toppings can have between 150 and 200 calories. A double-patty burger can have between 300 and 400 calories. If you add condiments like ketchup, mayo, or cheese, the calorie count can go up significantly.</p>

<p>There are also other factors that can affect the calorie count of a grilled burger. The type of meat you use and the amount of fat in the meat are two of the most important. A beef patty can have up to 300 calories, while a turkey patty can have as few as 100 calories. If you use a leaner cut of beef, your burger will have fewer calories. The same goes for turkey. If you use ground turkey breast, your burger will have fewer calories.</p>

<p>The type of bun you use can also affect the calorie count of a grilled burger. A whole-wheat bun can have up to 200 calories, while a white bun can have as few as 100 calories. It's also important to consider the type of cheese you use. A slice of American cheese can add up to 70 calories, while a slice of Swiss cheese can add up to 40 calories.</p>

<p>It's also important to consider the condiments and toppings you use. Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise can all add calories. Toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, and onions are low calorie and can add flavor without adding too many calories. Adding bacon or avocado can also increase the calorie count significantly.</p>

<p>In general, a single-patty grilled burger without condiments or toppings can have between 150 and 200 calories. A double-patty burger can have between 300 and 400 calories. The calorie count can increase significantly if you add condiments, cheese, and other toppings. If you're watching your calorie intake, you can opt for a leaner cut of meat and a whole-wheat bun to keep the calorie count low.</p>
