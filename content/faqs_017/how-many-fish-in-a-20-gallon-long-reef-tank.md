A 20 gallon long reef tank is one of the most popular types of aquariums, due to its smaller size and the fact that reef tanks require more maintenance than other types of aquariums. They are also popular because they can be set up relatively quickly and easily, and can be a great way to get started in the hobby of fishkeeping. But when it comes to stocking your tank, it's important to know how many fish you can safely put in a 20 gallon long reef tank.

<h2>What Size is a 20 Gallon Long Reef Tank?</h2>

A 20 gallon long reef tank is a standard rectangle aquarium that is 30 inches long and 12 inches wide, with a height of 17-20 inches. This tank size is often referred to as a “long” because it is longer than it is wide, as opposed to a “tall” which is taller than it is wide.

<h2>How Many Fish Can Fit in a 20 Gallon Long Reef Tank?</h2>

The amount of fish that can fit in a 20 gallon long reef tank will depend on a variety of factors, such as the size and species of the fish, the type of setup, and the level of maintenance that you are able to provide. Generally speaking, you should only keep one or two fish in a 20 gallon long reef tank, with a maximum of three if the fish are smaller and the tank is heavily planted. You may be able to keep more fish if the tank is larger, but this should only be done if you are able to provide the necessary care and maintenance that these fish require.

<h2>What Types of Fish Should I Put in a 20 Gallon Long Reef Tank?</h2>

When it comes to stocking your 20 gallon long reef tank, you should aim to choose fish that are not too large, as they will require more space and more maintenance than smaller fish. Some good choices for a 20 gallon long reef tank include damselfish, clownfish, gobies, dottybacks, blennies, and dwarf angelfish. You should also opt for fish that are reef-safe, as they will not harm any of the corals or invertebrates that you may have in your tank.

<h2>How Many Invertebrates Can I Put in a 20 Gallon Long Reef Tank?</h2>

In addition to fish, you can also keep a variety of invertebrates in your 20 gallon long reef tank, such as snails, crabs, shrimps, and starfish. These animals can help to keep your tank clean by feeding on algae and detritus, as well as providing a bit of interest to your tank. It is important to note, however, that some invertebrates may be aggressive towards each other or towards your fish, so it is best to research each species before adding them to your tank.

<h2>What Other Factors Should I Consider When Stocking a 20 Gallon Long Reef Tank?</h2>

When stocking your 20 gallon long reef tank, you should consider the type of filtration that you are using, as this will determine how many fish you can safely keep in your tank.
