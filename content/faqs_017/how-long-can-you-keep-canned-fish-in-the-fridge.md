Canned fish is a great way to add a quick and easy protein boost to your meals. Whether it's a tuna sandwich or a delicious salmon pasta dish, canned fish is a great option to keep in your pantry. But one common question is, how long can you keep canned fish in the fridge?

The answer to this question depends on a few factors. The type of canned fish, whether it's been opened or not, and the storage conditions all have an impact on how long the canned fish can stay fresh. So let's take a closer look at how long you can keep canned fish in the fridge.

<h2>Types of Canned Fish</h2>

The type of canned fish you're dealing with will play a role in how long you can keep it in the fridge. Generally, canned fish that has been cooked (such as tuna and salmon) can be stored in the fridge for up to three days, while canned fish that's been packed in oil (such as sardines and anchovies) should be eaten within two days.

<h2>Unopened Canned Fish</h2>

If you're dealing with an unopened can of fish, it can generally be kept in the pantry or cupboard for up to two years. However, it's important to check the expiration date on the can, as this will give you an indication of how long the fish will stay fresh. It's also important to store the cans in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

<h2>Opened Canned Fish</h2>

If you've opened a can of fish, it's best to use it within two days. It's important to transfer the fish to an airtight container and store it in the fridge. Once the fish has been opened, it's best to eat it within two days to ensure that it stays fresh and safe to eat.

<h2>Freezing Canned Fish</h2>

If you can't use the canned fish within the recommended timespan, you can always freeze it. To freeze canned fish, make sure that it's stored in an airtight container, and put it in the freezer. The fish should remain safe to eat for up to two months. When you're ready to use the fish, make sure to thaw it in the fridge overnight before eating.

<h2>When to Throw Away Canned Fish</h2>

The last thing to keep in mind is when to throw away canned fish. If the can is bulging, or if the fish has a strange smell or taste, then it's best to discard it. If the fish is no longer sealed, or the can looks rusty or dented, then it's also best to discard it.
