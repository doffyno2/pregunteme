<p>Cogs are the robotic characters that appear in the Toontown universe and are the primary antagonists of the game. They are the main enemy of the Toon race and they come in many shapes and sizes, each with their own unique abilities and weaknesses. But one thing all Cogs have in common is that they all have health, and knowing how much health each Cog has can help you figure out the best way to take them down.</p>

<h2>How Health Works in Toontown</h2>

<p>In Toontown, all characters have health points. Each time a character takes damage, their health points are reduced. When all of a character's health points are depleted, they are defeated and the fight is over. Cogs are no different, and all Cogs have a certain amount of health points that must be depleted before they can be defeated. Knowing how much health a Cog has can help you plan your strategy and figure out the best way to take them down.</p>

<h2>The Different Types of Cogs</h2>

<p>There are many different types of Cogs in Toontown, each with their own unique abilities and weaknesses. They are divided into four tiers, with each tier having different amounts of health and different abilities and weaknesses. The tiers are Flunky, Pencil Pusher, Yesman, and Boss Cogs. Each tier gets progressively stronger, with the Boss Cogs having the highest amounts of health.</p>

<h3>Flunky Cogs</h3>

<p>Flunky Cogs are the weakest of the Cogs and have the lowest amount of health. They have very basic attacks and can be defeated easily. They are the easiest Cogs to defeat, and even a single Toon can take them down with relative ease. Flunky Cogs have 10 health points.</p>

<h3>Pencil Pusher Cogs</h3>

<p>Pencil Pusher Cogs are the next tier of Cogs, and they have more health than Flunky Cogs. They have more powerful attacks and can be more difficult to defeat. It often takes multiple Toons to take down a Pencil Pusher, and even then it can be a challenge. Pencil Pusher Cogs have 20 health points.</p>

<h3>Yesman Cogs</h3>

<p>Yesman Cogs are the third tier of Cogs and are even stronger than Pencil Pusher Cogs. They have more powerful attacks and more health, and it often takes multiple Toons to take them down. Yesman Cogs have 30 health points.</p>

<h3>Boss Cogs</h3>

<p>Boss Cogs are the strongest of the Cogs and have the highest amount of health. They have the most powerful attacks and can be very difficult to defeat. It often takes a group of Toons to take down a Boss Cog, and even then it can be a challenge. Boss Cogs have 50 health points.</p>
