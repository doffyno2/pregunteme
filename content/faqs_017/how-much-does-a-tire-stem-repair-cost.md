<p>Tire stem repair is an important part of maintaining your vehicle. A tire stem is a small valve at the center of your tire that lets air in and out when you fill the tire with air. A faulty tire stem can lead to air leakage and a decrease in the tire’s performance. This can be a serious safety risk, so it’s important to repair or replace the tire stem as soon as it is noticed. But how much does a tire stem repair cost?</p>
