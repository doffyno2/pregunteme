Camper shells, also known as truck caps, are a popular accessory for those who own pickup trucks. Whether you need additional cargo space or some extra protection from the elements, a camper shell is a great way to get the job done. But before you make a purchase, you may be wondering: How much does a camper shell weigh?

<h2>What Factors Affect the Weight of a Camper Shell?</h2>

The weight of a camper shell depends on a few factors, including its size, material, and design. Most camper shells are made from either fiberglass or aluminum. Fiberglass is the heavier of the two materials and is often the more popular choice because it provides a smoother and more stylish finish. Aluminum camper shells weigh less than fiberglass shells and are a popular choice for those looking for a lightweight shell with a more rugged look.

The size of the shell will also affect its weight. Larger shells require more material and will be heavier as a result. And finally, the design of the shell will also make a difference. A shell with extra features, like windows or a pop-up roof, will be heavier than a basic shell.

<h2>How Much Does an Average Camper Shell Weigh?</h2>

On average, a camper shell will weigh between 80 and 200 pounds. Fiberglass shells tend to weigh more than aluminum shells. A small, basic aluminum shell can weigh as little as 80 pounds while a large, feature-rich fiberglass shell can weigh up to 200 pounds.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of a Camper Shell?</h2>

Camper shells are popular for a variety of reasons. They provide additional storage space for your truck, keep your cargo safe from the elements, and can even reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. Depending on the size and design of your shell, you may also be able to fit a small mattress inside for camping trips.

<h2>Are There Any Disadvantages to a Camper Shell?</h2>

The biggest downside to a camper shell is the weight. As we’ve discussed, camper shells can be quite heavy, which can put extra strain on your truck’s suspension system. If you’re planning on carrying a lot of heavy cargo in your shell, you may want to consider upgrading your suspension system before you install the shell.

<h2>Can I Install a Camper Shell Myself?</h2>

The installation process for a camper shell varies depending on the make and model of your truck. Most shells come with detailed installation instructions and can be installed with simple hand tools. If you don’t have the necessary tools or experience, you may want to consider having a professional install the shell for you.
