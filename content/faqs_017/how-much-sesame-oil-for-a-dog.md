<p>Sesame oil has many benefits for both humans and animals, and it is no surprise that many pet owners are now adding it to their dog's diet. The oil is rich in antioxidants and fatty acids, making it a great supplement to help keep your dog healthy and strong. But how much sesame oil should you give your dog?</p>

<p>The answer depends on your dog's size, age, and overall health. Generally, it is recommended that you give your dog between 1/4 and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil per 10 pounds of body weight. This amount can be adjusted depending on your dog's individual needs. For example, older dogs may benefit from higher doses of sesame oil, while puppies and smaller dogs may need a lower dose.</p>

<p>It is also important to consider the type of sesame oil you are giving your dog. The best type of sesame oil for your dog is one that is cold-pressed and unrefined.

The oil should only be given to your pet a few times a week in order to provide the most health benefits.</p>
