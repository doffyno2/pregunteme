World of Warcraft (WoW) is an online role-playing game that is played by millions of people around the world. Killing monsters and completing quests are some of the main ways you can gain experience and reputation in the game. But do you know how much reputation you can get for killing in WoW?

<h2>What is Reputation in WoW?</h2>

Reputation in WoW is a measure of how well liked and respected your character is in the game. It is based on the number of quests you have completed, the number of monsters you have killed, and the number of other players you have interacted with. Your reputation can affect how other players and NPCs (non-player characters) interact with you, as well as give you access to certain items and quests that can only be obtained with a certain level of reputation.

<h2>How Do You Gain Reputation in WoW?</h2>

There are several different ways to gain reputation in WoW. The most common way is by completing quests and killing monsters. Quests are tasks given to you by NPCs that require you to complete certain objectives, such as killing a certain number of monsters or retrieving an item from a monster. Completing these quests will reward you with experience points, gold, and reputation points.

Killing monsters is another way to gain reputation in WoW. Every monster you kill will give you a certain amount of reputation points. The more powerful the monster, the more reputation points you will receive. You can also gain reputation by helping other players or completing certain tasks for NPCs.

<h2>How Much Reputation Do You Get for Killing in WoW?</h2>

The amount of reputation you get for killing monsters in WoW depends on a few factors. The first is the type of monster you are killing. Generally speaking, higher level monsters will give you more reputation points than lower level monsters. The second factor is the difficulty of the monster. The harder the monster is to kill, the more reputation points you will receive. Finally, the number of monsters you kill will also affect how much reputation you get. The more monsters you kill, the more reputation points you will receive. 

In general, you can expect to get around 5-10 reputation points per monster killed, depending on the type and difficulty of the monster. This can add up quickly if you are killing multiple monsters in a short period of time, or if you are fighting a powerful monster.
