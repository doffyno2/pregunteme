<p>The Boeing 737 is one of the most popular passenger planes in the world, and it is used by airlines all over the world for domestic and international flights. The 737 is a reliable and efficient plane, capable of flying at speeds of up to Mach 0.82, which is equivalent to around 896 km/h (558 mph).</p>

<p>The Boeing 737 is a twin-engine jet airliner, and it is available in two main variants, the 737-700 and the 737-800. The 737-700 is a short- to medium-range airliner, while the 737-800 is a medium- to long-range aircraft. Both variants can carry up to 189 passengers in a single-class layout, and they are powered by two CFM International CFM56-7B engines.</p>

<h2>How Fast Does a 737-700 Fly?</h2>

<p>The Boeing 737-700 is a short- to medium-range airliner, and it is typically used for domestic and regional flights. The 737-700 is powered by two CFM International CFM56-7B engines, and it is capable of cruising at speeds of up to Mach 0.78, which is equivalent to around 871 km/h (541 mph).</p>

<h2>How Fast Does a 737-800 Fly?</h2>

<p>The Boeing 737-800 is a medium- to long-range airliner, and it is typically used for international flights. The 737-800 is powered by two CFM International CFM56-7B engines, and it is capable of cruising at speeds of up to Mach 0.82, which is equivalent to around 896 km/h (558 mph).</p>

<h2>What Factors Affect the Speed of a 737 Passenger Plane?</h2>

<p>The speed of a Boeing 737 passenger plane is affected by several factors, such as the type of engine, the altitude, the air temperature, and the weight of the aircraft. The higher the altitude, the faster the plane can fly, as the air is thinner and less dense at higher altitudes. The air temperature also affects the speed of the plane, as colder air is denser than warm air and can cause drag on the aircraft.</p>

<p>The weight of the aircraft is also a factor, as heavier planes require more power to reach the same speed as lighter planes. The type of engine used in the aircraft also affects the speed of the plane, as different engines have different power output and efficiency ratings.</p>

<h2>What is the Maximum Operating Speed of a 737 Passenger Plane?</h2>

<p>The maximum operating speed of a Boeing 737 passenger plane is Mach 0.82, which is equivalent to around 896 km/h (558 mph). This speed is only achievable in ideal flying conditions, such as at high altitudes and in warm air. In more typical conditions, such as at lower altitudes and in colder air, the speed of the plane is typically lower.</p>
