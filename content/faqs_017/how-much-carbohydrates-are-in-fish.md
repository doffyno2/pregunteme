How Much Carbohydrates Are In Fish?

Fish is a popular source of lean protein, but it's also a source of carbohydrates. The amount of carbohydrates in fish varies depending on the type of fish, but most types of fish contain some carbohydrates. Understanding the amount of carbohydrates in fish can help you make healthy dietary choices.


Carbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients, along with protein and fat. They provide energy for your body and are found in many foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products. The two types of carbohydrates are simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates are broken down quickly by the body and provide a quick source of energy, while complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and provide a steady source of energy.


Most types of fish contain some carbohydrates, though the exact amount varies depending on the type of fish. Generally, fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel contain more carbohydrates than leaner fish such as cod and flounder. Some types of fish, such as tuna and sardines, are high in protein but low in carbohydrates.

In general, a 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of cooked fish contains about 0–2 grams of carbohydrates, depending on the type. This is higher than the 0–1 gram of carbohydrates in a 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of chicken or beef.


If you’re looking for a low-carbohydrate fish option, try one of these varieties:

<h2>Tuna</h2>
Tuna is a versatile fish that is low in carbohydrates. A 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of cooked tuna contains 0 grams of carbohydrates. Tuna is also a good source of lean protein and contains essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B-12, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids.

<h2>Sardines</h2>
Sardines are small, silvery fish that are an excellent source of lean protein and omega-3 fatty acids. A 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of cooked sardines contains 0 grams of carbohydrates. Sardines are also a good source of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D and calcium.

<h2>Trout</h2>
Trout is a popular freshwater fish that is low in carbohydrates. A 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of cooked trout contains 0–1 gram of carbohydrates. Trout is also a good source of lean protein and omega-3 fatty acids.

<h2>Cod</h2>
Cod is a mild-tasting white fish that is low in carbohydrates. A 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of cooked cod contains 0–1 gram of carbohydrates. Cod is also a good source of lean protein, vitamin B-12, and omega-3 fatty acids.

<h2>Flounder</h2>
Flounder is a mild-tasting flatfish that is low in carbohydrates. A 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of cooked flounder contains 0–1 gram of carbohydrates. Flounder is also a good source of lean protein, vitamin B-12, and omega-3 fatty acids.


In addition to being low in carbohydrates, fish is a nutritious source of lean protein and healthy fats. Eating fish may help reduce inflammation, improve heart health, and reduce the risk of certain diseases. It may also help promote weight loss and improve brain health.

<h2>Inflammation</h2>
Eating fish may help reduce inflammation in the body, which is linked to many chronic diseases. Studies have found that people who eat fish regularly have lower levels of inflammatory markers than those who don't.

<h2>Heart Health</h2>
Fish is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential fats that help protect the heart and lower blood pressure. Studies have found that eating fish regularly can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.

<h2>Weight Loss</h2>
Fish is a lean source of protein, which is important for weight loss. Protein helps you feel full longer, which can help you eat fewer calories and lose weight.

<h2>Brain Health</h2>
Omega-3 fatty acids are important for brain health. Eating fish regularly may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and improve mental health.
