Yeti coolers have become an essential part of any outdoor enthusiast's gear. Whether you're camping, hiking, or just having a BBQ in your backyard, a Yeti cooler is an essential item. But how many ounces are in a Yeti?

The answer depends on the size of the cooler you have. Yeti coolers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from 20 ounces all the way up to 350 ounces. The most common sizes are 20, 30, 45, 65, and 90 ounce Yeti coolers. 

Yeti coolers come in a variety of materials, including hard plastic, soft-sided fabric, and even insulated stainless steel. The material of the cooler will also affect how many ounces you can fit inside. For example, hard plastic coolers typically hold more ounces than soft-sided fabric coolers. 

<h2>Factors That Affect How Many Ounces Fit in a Yeti Cooler</h2>

The size of the Yeti cooler is only one factor that will affect how many ounces it can hold. Other factors such as the type of food and drinks you are storing, the type of ice used, and the size of the ice cubes will all affect the amount of ounces a Yeti can hold. 

The type of food and drinks you are storing will affect the amount of ounces in a Yeti cooler. If you are storing mostly liquids, such as beer or soda, the cooler will hold fewer ounces than if you are storing more solid items such as sandwiches or salads. 

The type of ice you are using will also affect how many ounces the Yeti can hold. Larger cubes of ice will occupy more space, leaving less room for food or drinks. Smaller cubes of ice will occupy less space and allow for more ounces to be stored. 

<h2>How to Maximize Space in a Yeti Cooler</h2>

If you want to maximize the amount of space in your Yeti cooler, there are a few things you can do. First, be sure to use the right type of ice for your cooler. Larger cubes of ice will take up more space and will limit the amount of food and drinks you can store. 

Second, make sure to pack your food and drinks as tightly as possible. This will help to reduce the amount of air in the cooler and will allow for more ounces to be stored. 

Finally, always try to make use of the space inside the cooler. If the cooler is large enough, you can often fit more items inside by stacking them on top of each other.
