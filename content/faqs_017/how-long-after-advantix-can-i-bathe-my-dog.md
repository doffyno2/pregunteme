This will give the product time to become absorbed into the dog’s skin and be less likely to be washed off in the bath.</p>

<h2>What Is The Best Way To Bathe A Dog After Applying Advantix?</h2>

<p>The best way to bathe a dog after applying Advantix is to use a mild soap or shampoo specifically designed for dogs.
