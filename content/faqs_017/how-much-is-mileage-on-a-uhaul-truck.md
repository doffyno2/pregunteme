Uhaul trucks are a great way to move your belongings in a safe and efficient manner. But, before you rent one, it’s important to understand how much mileage is included in the rental and when you will be charged for additional mileage. In this article, we’ll explain the different ways Uhaul charges for mileage and how to calculate the cost of your rental.

<h2>What Is Mileage?</h2>

Mileage is the distance that a vehicle travels between two points. It's usually measured in miles or kilometers. When you rent a Uhaul truck, you will be charged for the total distance you travel with the truck. This includes the distance it takes to get from the Uhaul store to your home and back, as well as any other driving you do with the truck.

<h2>How Does Uhaul Calculate Mileage?</h2>

Uhaul uses a flat-rate system to calculate mileage. This means that you will be charged the same amount for each mile that you drive with the truck. Uhaul charges different rates for different trucks, so it’s important to check the rate for the truck you’re renting before you make your reservation.

<h2>How Much Does Uhaul Charge for Mileage?</h2>

Uhaul charges different rates for different trucks. For example, the rental rate for a 10-foot truck is $19.95 per day plus $0.99 per mile. The rental rate for a 20-foot truck is $29.95 per day plus $0.89 per mile. The rental rate for a 26-foot truck is $39.95 per day plus $0.79 per mile.

<h2>How Can I Calculate My Mileage Cost?</h2>

To calculate the cost of your rental, simply multiply the number of miles you plan to drive with the truck by the per-mile rate. For example, if you plan to drive 300 miles with a 10-foot truck, you would multiply 300 by $0.99 to get a total mileage cost of $297.

<h2>What If I Go Over My Allotted Mileage?</h2>

If you go over the allotted mileage for your rental, Uhaul will charge you an additional fee. The fee is usually based on the per-mile rate of the truck you’re renting. So, if you go over the allotted mileage of a 10-foot truck, you would be charged $0.99 for each additional mile.

Yes, you can buy extra miles from Uhaul. Uhaul offers pre-paid miles in packages of 50, 100, 200, and 500 miles. These packages can be purchased in addition to your rental, and the cost is based on the per-mile rate of the truck you’re renting.

<h2>What If I Don’t Use All My Pre-Paid Miles?</h2>
