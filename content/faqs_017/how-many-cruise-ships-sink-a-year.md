How Many Cruise Ships Sink a Year?
Cruise ships are among the safest and most secure vessels in the world. They are built to the highest safety standards and are constantly monitored for any potential issues. Despite their safety, cruise ships do occasionally sink, though the number is incredibly rare. In this article, we'll look at how many cruise ships sink a year and any other factors that might be at play.



The number of cruise ships that sink each year is incredibly low. The vast majority of cruise ships sail without incident and make it back to port safely. According to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), there were nearly 25 million passengers on cruise ships in 2019, and the number of cruise ships that sank during that year was zero. 

While this statistic is impressive, there have been a few incidents in which cruise ships have sunk or come close to sinking. In 2012, the Costa Concordia cruise ship ran aground off the coast of Italy, resulting in 32 deaths. In 2015, the MS Royal Majesty ran aground off the coast of Massachusetts and nearly sank. 

<h2>Factors That Contribute to Cruise Ships Sinking</h2>

While the number of cruise ships that sink each year is low, there are certain factors that can contribute to a cruise ship sinking or coming close to sinking. 

The first factor is human error. The majority of cruise ship incidents can be attributed to human error, including the Costa Concordia and MS Royal Majesty incidents. It is important to note that the vast majority of these incidents are preventable and can be avoided with proper training and oversight.

The second factor is the weather. While cruise ships are designed to withstand most types of weather, extreme weather can still cause problems. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian caused significant damage to the Grand Bahama Island, including the Grand Celebration cruise ship. The ship was severely damaged by the storm, but fortunately, all passengers and crew were rescued. 

The third factor is mechanical failure. While cruise ships are designed to be reliable and safe, mechanical failure can still occur. In 2013, the Carnival Triumph cruise ship experienced an engine fire and was stranded in the Gulf of Mexico for several days before being towed to port. 

<h2>How to Avoid Cruise Ship Sinking</h2>

Fortunately, there are steps you can take to ensure that your cruise is as safe and secure as possible. The first step is to research the cruise line and ship you are planning to take. Make sure the cruise line has a good safety record and that the ship is certified by the International Maritime Organization. 

The second step is to pay attention to the weather. If there is a storm or other dangerous weather in the area, it is best to postpone or cancel your cruise. 

Finally, make sure you are familiar with the safety procedures on the ship. All cruise ships will have safety briefings and demonstrations before sailing, and it is important to pay attention and follow all instructions.
