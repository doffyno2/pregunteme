Protein is essential for sustaining a healthy and active lifestyle, and supplementing your daily protein intake is a great way to get all the nutrients and benefits of this powerful macronutrient. But, when it comes to protein supplements, how much should you take per day? 

In this article, we'll look at the recommended daily protein intake, how much protein you can get from food, and how much protein supplement you should take per day to meet your daily needs. 

<h2>How Much Protein Should You Consume Each Day?</h2>

The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g per kilogram of body weight per day for healthy adults. This means that for a person who weighs 70 kg (154 lbs), the recommended daily allowance for protein is 56 g per day. 

However, this number is just the minimum amount of protein you should be consuming each day. Depending on your lifestyle and goals, you may need to increase your daily protein intake. 

<h2>How Much Protein Can You Get From Food?</h2>

If you're looking to increase your daily protein intake, it's important to understand the foods that provide the highest amounts of protein. 

The foods that contain the highest amounts of protein per serving include eggs, fish, poultry, beef, and dairy products. For example, a single egg contains 6 g of protein, and a 4 oz serving of fish contains about 25 g of protein. 

You can also get protein from plant-based sources such as beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds. For example, a single cup of cooked lentils contains about 18 g of protein. 

<h2>How Much Protein Supplement Should You Take Each Day?</h2>

If you're looking to increase your daily protein intake, protein supplements can be a great way to do it. But how much should you take per day? 

The amount of protein supplement you should take each day depends on your daily protein needs and goals. If you're looking to build muscle, you may need to increase your daily protein intake to 1.2–2.2 g/kg (0.5–1 g/lb) of body weight per day. 

For healthy adults, the maximum recommended daily amount of protein supplement is 2 g per kilogram of body weight per day. This means that for a person who weighs 70 kg (154 lbs), the maximum recommended daily amount of protein supplement is 140 g per day. 

<h2>What Are The Benefits Of Taking Protein Supplements?</h2>

Protein supplements can provide you with a convenient way to increase your daily protein intake. They are also a great source of fast-digesting protein, which can help to support muscle growth and recovery after exercise. 

Protein supplements also contain essential amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. These amino acids can help to promote muscle growth and repair, as well as support other bodily functions. 

<h2>What Are The Risks Of Taking Protein Supplements?</h2>

Although protein supplements can be beneficial, they can also have some risks associated with them. For example, some protein supplements may contain ingredients that can cause allergic reactions or digestive problems. 

It's important to read the label of any protein supplement you're considering and check for any potential allergens or irritants. It's also important to talk to your doctor before starting any new supplement. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Protein supplements can be a great way to increase your daily protein intake and support your health and fitness goals. However, it's important to understand how much protein supplement you should take per day and the potential risks associated with taking too much. 

By understanding your daily protein needs and goals, you can determine the right amount of protein supplement for you. This will help you get the most out of your protein supplement and ensure you're getting the nutrients you need to stay healthy and active.
