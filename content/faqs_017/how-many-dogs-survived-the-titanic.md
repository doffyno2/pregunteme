<p>The Titanic is one of the most famous and tragic events in history. On April 15th, 1912, the RMS Titanic struck an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in the deaths of 1,500 passengers and crew. Many of the passengers aboard the Titanic were accompanied by their beloved pets, but sadly, most of these animals perished in the icy waters of the Atlantic. But, how many dogs actually survived the Titanic?</p>

<h2>The Dogs Aboard the Titanic</h2>

<p>When it comes to the Titanic, there are many questions that remain unanswered, and the number of dogs that survived the tragedy is one of them.

Another dog, a Pekingese named Sun Yat-Sen, is said to have survived the Titanic as well; however, its whereabouts after the tragedy remain unknown.</p>

<h2>Animals Left Behind</h2>
