The 2016 movie War Dogs is based on a true story. It tells the story of two friends, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who become international arms dealers. The movie is an adaptation of Guy Lawson’s Rolling Stone article “Arms and the Dudes,” which recounts the events leading up to the pair’s arrest. But how much of the movie is actually true?

<h2>Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz</h2>

The movie is based on a true story, and the two main characters – Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz – are real people. Diveroli and Packouz were childhood friends from Miami Beach, Florida. They first met in high school and later reconnected in their twenties.

Diveroli was a born salesman and Packouz was an entrepreneur looking for his big break. They then decided to join forces and started a business selling weapons and ammo to the US government.

<h2>The Business</h2>

In 2007, Diveroli and Packouz founded AEY Inc., an arms-dealing company. The company specialized in selling surplus military equipment to the US government. The two friends quickly landed a $300 million contract with the Pentagon to supply munitions to the Afghan National Army.

Though they were inexperienced, the friends managed to secure the contract through a combination of luck and cunning. They made a series of risky moves, including cutting corners and skirting the law.

<h2>The Movie</h2>

The 2016 movie War Dogs is based on the true story of Diveroli and Packouz. The movie follows the two friends as they navigate the world of international arms dealing. It stars Miles Teller as Packouz and Jonah Hill as Diveroli.

The movie is a dramatization of the events leading up to the pair’s arrest in 2009. It follows their rise and fall as they attempt to make their fortune in the world of arms dealing.

<h2>How Much is True?</h2>

While the movie is based on a true story, it does contain some dramatic license. For example, the movie depicts Diveroli and Packouz as far more reckless and ambitious than they actually were. 

In reality, the pair were not involved in any shady dealings or major international arms deals. They were simply two friends who got in over their heads with a $300 million contract.

<h2>The Arrest</h2>

The movie accurately depicts the pair’s arrest in 2009. They were charged with wire fraud and accused of shipping Chinese-made ammunition to the Afghan military, which violated a US arms embargo.

Though the charges were serious, the two friends managed to avoid jail time. In 2011, Diveroli was sentenced to four years of probation and Packouz was sentenced to seven months of house arrest and community service.

<h2>The Aftermath</h2>

Since their arrest, Diveroli and Packouz have gone their separate ways. Diveroli has kept a relatively low profile, but Packouz has become an outspoken advocate for prison reform. He has also started a number of companies, including Beat Bedding, a mattress company, and an app called MediConnect.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The movie War Dogs is based on a true story. It follows the adventures of two childhood friends who become international arms dealers. Though the movie contains some dramatic license, it accurately depicts the events leading up to their arrest in 2009.
