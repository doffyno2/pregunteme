Pregnant dogs experience a variety of changes in their bodies that are associated with the pregnancy. One of the most significant changes is the drop in temperature that occurs when a dog is pregnant. Knowing how long this temperature drop lasts can help pet owners to be aware of when the dog is due to give birth. In this article, we will discuss how long a pregnant dog's temperature drop typically lasts and what other physical changes to expect during pregnancy.

<h2>What is the Normal Temperature of a Pregnant Dog?</h2>

The normal temperature of a pregnant dog is between 100.5 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. A pregnant dog's temperature may drop a few degrees below this range, but it is important to note that this drop is normal. A temperature drop below 100 degrees Fahrenheit may be a sign of illness and should be checked by a veterinarian immediately.

<h2>When Does the Temperature Drop Occur in Pregnant Dogs?</h2>

The temperature drop usually occurs between days 45 and 60 of the pregnancy. It is important to note that each dog is different, so the temperature drop may occur earlier or later in some cases.

<h2>How Long Does the Temperature Drop Last?</h2>

The temperature drop typically lasts between two and four days. During this time, the temperature should remain below the normal range and may even dip below 99 degrees Fahrenheit. After the temperature drop, the pregnant dog's temperature should return to its normal range.

<h2>What Other Physical Changes Occur During Pregnancy?</h2>

In addition to the temperature drop, there are other physical changes that occur during pregnancy in dogs. These changes include an increase in appetite, weight gain, and an increase in the size of the abdomen. The nipples will also become enlarged and the mammary glands will swell. In addition, the dog may become more sensitive to touch and may become more affectionate.

<h2>What Should Pet Owners Do During Pregnancy?</h2>

It is important for pet owners to take special care of their pregnant dogs during this time. Pet owners should monitor the dog's temperature regularly to ensure that it is within the normal range. In addition, pet owners should make sure the pregnant dog is getting adequate nutrition and exercise. They should also consult with their veterinarian for any medical issues that may arise.
