Cooked fish cakes are a popular meal item and a great way to use up leftovers. But how long can fish cakes last in the fridge? The answer depends on several factors, including the type of fish used, the method of cooking, and the time and temperature at which the fish cakes were stored. In this article, we'll discuss these factors and give you tips on how to keep your cooked fish cakes safe and delicious.

<h2>What Type of Fish Is Used in Fish Cakes?</h2>

Fish cakes are usually made from white fish, such as cod, haddock, or pollock. However, some recipes call for salmon or other oily fish, which can change the storage time of the fish cakes. Oily fish tends to spoil more quickly, so it is important to pay attention to the type of fish used in the recipe.

<h2>How Were the Fish Cakes Cooked?</h2>

Cooked fish cakes can be prepared in a variety of ways, including baking, pan-frying, or deep-frying. Baked or pan-fried fish cakes tend to last longer than deep-fried ones, as the fat content of the fish cakes is lower and the texture is less likely to become soggy. 

<h2>How Should You Store Cooked Fish Cakes?</h2>

Cooked fish cakes should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. This will help to keep the fish cakes fresh and prevent them from spoiling. It is best to eat the fish cakes within two days of cooking. If you need to store them longer, you can freeze the fish cakes for up to three months.
