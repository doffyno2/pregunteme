<h2>What Is A Flea Dip?</h2>

A flea dip is a type of chemical bath that is used to kill and remove fleas, ticks, and other parasites from your pet’s fur and skin. The bath is applied by a professional groomer or veterinarian and typically lasts between 10 and 20 minutes. The chemicals used in a flea dip may vary, but are often pyrethrins, which are natural compounds derived from chrysanthemums.

It’s important to note that some flea dips may contain harsh chemicals that can be toxic to your pet, so it’s important to discuss the potential risks with your veterinarian before proceeding with a flea dip.
