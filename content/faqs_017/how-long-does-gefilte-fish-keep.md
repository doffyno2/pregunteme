<h2>What is Gefilte Fish?</h2>

Gefilte fish is a Jewish dish made from ground or whole white fish, such as carp, pike, whitefish, and herring. The fish is then combined with eggs, bread crumbs, and seasonings, and then formed into a cake-like shape. The mixture is then boiled in a broth, often referred to as “gefilte fish water”. The finished product is usually served cold, with horseradish and lemon as condiments. 

<h2>Storing Gefilte Fish</h2>

Gefilte fish must be stored properly in order to maintain its freshness and ensure that it is safe to eat. Uncooked gefilte fish can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. If the gefilte fish is not going to be eaten within this time frame, it should be frozen in an airtight container.
