Airbnb is one of the leading companies in the sharing economy, enabling people to rent out their homes for short-term stays. As such, it’s essential for Airbnb to verify the identities of its users in order to ensure the safety and security of its platform. This process, known as Airbnb ID verification, can take anywhere from a few minutes to several days, depending on the type of verification chosen.

<h2>What is Airbnb ID Verification?</h2>

Airbnb ID verification is a process through which Airbnb confirms the identity of its users. This is done in order to protect the safety and security of its platform and to ensure that all users are who they say they are. Airbnb ID verification can be done either manually or through the use of third-party services.

<h2>Manual ID Verification</h2>

Manual ID verification is the simplest and quickest way to verify a user’s identity on Airbnb. All users have to do is provide either a valid driver’s license or a passport in order to be verified. This process typically takes just a few minutes and can be done online or through the Airbnb app.

<h2>Third-Party Verification Services</h2>

Third-party verification services are a more comprehensive way to verify a user’s identity on Airbnb. These services require users to provide additional information such as a phone number or address, as well as a photo of themselves. The process typically takes longer than manual ID verification, usually between one and two days.

<h2>How to Get Verified on Airbnb</h2>
