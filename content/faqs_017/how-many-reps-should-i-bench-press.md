Bench press is one of the most popular exercises among gym-goers and bodybuilders alike. It's a great way to build strength, improve muscle definition, and increase overall muscle mass. But the question many people have is: how many reps should I bench press?

The answer to this question depends on a variety of factors, including your current strength level, the type of bench press you're doing, and your goals. In this article, we'll take a look at the recommended number of reps you should be doing when bench pressing, as well as some tips for optimizing your technique.

<h2>What is a Rep?</h2>

Before we answer the question of how many reps you should be doing when bench pressing, it's important to understand what a rep is. A rep is one complete repetition of an exercise. So, for example, if you bench press a barbell up and down 10 times in a row, that would be 10 reps.

<h2>How Many Reps Should You Bench Press?</h2>

The answer to this question depends on a variety of factors, including your current strength level, the type of bench press you're doing, and your goals. For instance, if you're a beginner who is just starting out with bench pressing, you should aim for 8-10 reps per set. This will help you build up your strength and get used to the motion.

If you're an intermediate lifter, you should aim for 6-8 reps per set. This will help you build strength and muscle mass. For advanced lifters, you should aim for 4-6 reps per set. This will help you develop power and strength.

It's important to note that the number of reps you should be doing can vary depending on the type of bench press you're doing. For instance, if you're doing an incline bench press, you should aim for 8-10 reps. If you're doing a decline bench press, you should aim for 6-8 reps.

<h2>Tips for Optimizing Your Bench Press Repetition</h2>

In addition to knowing how many reps you should be doing when bench pressing, it's important to optimize your technique. Here are some tips for doing so:
