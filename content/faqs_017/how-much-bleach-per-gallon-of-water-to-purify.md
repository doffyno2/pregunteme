<p>When it comes to purifying water, bleach is a popular choice. It's cheap, it's easy to use, and it can help make water safe to drink. But how much bleach do you need to use per gallon of water? The answer depends on a few factors, including the type of bleach you're using and the level of contamination in the water.</p>

<h2>Types of Bleach</h2>

<p>There are two main types of bleach that are commonly used to purify water. The first is liquid chlorine bleach, which is the most common and widely available type of bleach. This is the type of bleach found in most stores and is the type most often recommended for water purification. The other type is granular chlorine, which is a dry form of bleach.</p>

<h2>Using Liquid Chlorine Bleach</h2>

<p>When using liquid chlorine bleach to purify water, the recommended amount is 8 drops per gallon of water. This will effectively kill most bacteria and viruses. If the water is cloudy or has particles in it, you should double the amount of bleach to 16 drops per gallon. If you are using a large container (such as a 55-gallon drum), you should use half a cup of bleach.</p>

<h2>Using Granular Chlorine</h2>

<p>When using granular chlorine to purify water, the recommended amount is 1 teaspoon per gallon of water. This will effectively kill most bacteria and viruses. If the water is cloudy or has particles in it, you should double the amount of bleach to 2 teaspoons per gallon. If you are using a large container (such as a 55-gallon drum), you should use 1/3 cup of bleach.</p>

<h2>How Long Does Bleach Take to Purify Water?</h2>

<p>Once the bleach is added to the water, you should wait at least 30 minutes before drinking the water. This will give the bleach enough time to kill any harmful bacteria or viruses that may be present in the water. After 30 minutes, the water should be safe to drink.</p>

<h2>How Long Does Bleach Last in Water?</h2>

<p>Bleach will remain effective in water for up to six months. After this time, the active ingredients in the bleach will start to break down and become ineffective. If you are storing water for long periods of time, it is important to add additional bleach every six months.</p>

<h3>Does bleach kill all bacteria and viruses?</h3>

<p>Bleach is effective at killing most bacteria and viruses, but it is not 100% effective. If you are purifying water that is contaminated with a particularly dangerous virus or bacteria, it is recommended that you use other methods of purification in addition to the bleach.</p>

<h3>Is bleach safe to drink?</h3>

<p>Bleach is not safe to drink in its concentrated form. When used to purify water, it should be added in small amounts and left to sit for at least 30 minutes. After this time, the bleach will have had enough time to kill any harmful bacteria or viruses, and the water should be safe to drink.</p>

<h3>Can bleach be used to purify water for long-term storage?</h3>

<p>Yes, bleach can be used to purify water for long-term storage. However, it is important to add additional bleach every six months, as the active ingredients in the bleach will start to break down after this time.</p>

<h3>Can bleach be used to purify sea water?</h3>

<p>Yes, bleach can be used to purify sea water. However, it is important to use a larger amount of bleach than usual, as sea water typically has a higher level of contamination than regular tap water.</p>

<h3>What is the best way to store bleach?</h3>

<p>The best way to store bleach is in a cool, dark place. Bleach can degrade over time if exposed to heat or light, so it is important to store it in a place where these factors wonâ€™t affect it.</p>

<h3>What are some alternatives to bleach for purifying water?</h3>

<p>Some alternatives to bleach for purifying water include boiling, distilling, and using ultraviolet light. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, so it is important to research each one and decide which one is best for your particular needs.</p>
