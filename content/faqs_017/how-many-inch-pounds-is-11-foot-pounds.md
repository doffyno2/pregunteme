<p>Foot-pound and inch-pound are two units of torque, also known as moment of force, used to measure the rotational force applied to an object. Although the two are related, they are not interchangeable and it is important to understand the difference between them. This article will discuss how to convert between foot-pound and inch-pound, and explain the difference between the two units.</p>

<h2>What Is the Difference Between Foot-Pound and Inch-Pound?</h2>

<p>Foot-pound is a unit of torque and is abbreviated as ft-lb. It is a measure of the force or torque needed to rotate an object one foot around its own axis. The abbreviation for inch-pound is in-lb. It is a measure of the force or torque needed to rotate an object one inch around its own axis.</p>

<h2>How To Convert Between Foot-Pound and Inch-Pound?</h2>

<p>The conversion between foot-pound and inch-pound is not straightforward and involves a calculation based on the length of the object to which the torque is applied. The formula to convert between foot-pound and inch-pound is as follows:</p>

<p>Inch-Pound = Foot-Pound x 12</p>

<p>Conversely, to convert from inch-pound to foot-pound, the formula is as follows:</p>

<p>Foot-Pound = Inch-Pound / 12</p>

<h2>Example of How To Convert Foot-Pound and Inch-Pound</h2>

<p>Let's take an example where we want to convert 11 foot-pounds of torque to inch-pounds. Using the formula above, we can calculate the result as follows:</p>

<p>Inch-Pound = 11 ft-lb x 12 = 132 in-lb</p>

<p>So, 11 foot-pounds of torque is equivalent to 132 inch-pounds.</p>

<h2>What Is the Application of Foot-Pound and Inch-Pound?</h2>

<p>Foot-pound and inch-pound are most commonly used to measure the amount of torque applied to a wrench or other hand tool when tightening a fastener. For example, a torque wrench may be set to a specific foot-pound or inch-pound setting to ensure that the fastener is tightened to a specified torque.</p>

<p>Foot-pound and inch-pound are also used to measure the torque applied to an engine's flywheel when an engine is started. This helps to ensure that the engine is able to rotate to its specified speed range without stalling.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Foot-pound and inch-pound are two units of torque used to measure the rotational force applied to an object. The two are not interchangeable and it is important to understand the difference between them. This article has discussed how to convert between foot-pound and inch-pound and explained the difference between the two units. It has also discussed the application of foot-pound and inch-pound.</p>
