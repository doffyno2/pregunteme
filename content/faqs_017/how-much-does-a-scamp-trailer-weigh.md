<p>When you're looking to buy a scamp trailer, it's important to consider the weight of the trailer. Knowing the weight will help you determine if your vehicle is capable of towing the trailer, and if it will fit within the guidelines of the campground you are visiting. So, how much does a scamp trailer weigh?</p>

<p>Scamp trailers come in many varieties, from the basic 13-foot model to the larger 19-foot model. The weight of the trailer can vary depending on the size and features of the trailer.
