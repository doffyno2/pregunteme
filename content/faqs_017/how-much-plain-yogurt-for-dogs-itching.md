Dogs itching can be a sign of a variety of skin issues, including allergies, flea bites, and dry skin. In some cases, a veterinarian may recommend including plain yogurt in your dog's diet to help soothe the itching. But how much plain yogurt should you give your pup? Here, we’ll discuss the benefits of plain yogurt for dogs, how much to feed your pup, and some other tips for helping your pup feel better.

<h2>Benefits of Plain Yogurt for Dogs</h2>

Plain yogurt can offer a variety of benefits to dogs. It is packed with protein and healthy bacteria, which can help improve your dog’s digestion. It can also help your pup fight bacterial infections and inflammation, leading to relief from itching. Some vets even recommend plain yogurt as a natural remedy for certain skin conditions.

<h2>How Much Plain Yogurt Should I Give My Dog?</h2>

The amount of plain yogurt you should give your pup will depend on their size and weight. However, as a general rule of thumb, you should only give your pup a tablespoon of plain yogurt for every 20 pounds of their body weight. So, for example, if your pup weighs 40 pounds, you should give them two tablespoons of yogurt. It’s important to make sure that you are giving your pup plain, unsweetened yogurt without any added flavors or preservatives. Sweetened yogurt can cause gastrointestinal issues in your pup and added flavors can lead to unwanted weight gain.

<h2>Tips for Feeding Your Dog Plain Yogurt</h2>

When feeding your pup plain yogurt, there are some tips to keep in mind. First, make sure that you are giving your pup the right amount of yogurt. Too much can cause diarrhea and vomiting, so it’s important to stick to the recommended amounts. Second, introduce plain yogurt to your pup slowly and in small amounts. Start with just a teaspoon and increase the amount each time. Finally, it’s important to make sure that the yogurt is plain and unsweetened. Sweetened yogurt can cause gastric distress in your pup.

<h2>Other Tips for Relieving Dog Itching</h2>

In addition to feeding your pup plain yogurt, there are other tips you can use to help relieve your pup’s itching. First, make sure that you are brushing your pup’s fur regularly. This can help reduce the amount of allergens, dust, and dirt that can accumulate in their coat and lead to itching. Second, make sure that you are bathing your pup regularly with a gentle shampoo. This can help reduce the amount of allergens and irritants that can accumulate on their skin. Finally, make sure that you are using a moisturizer on your pup’s skin. This can help keep their skin hydrated and reduce the amount of dryness and itching.
