<p>Orcas, also known as killer whales, are the largest species of the dolphin family and are found in every ocean in the world. These powerful animals have been admired by humans for centuries, but unfortunately, their numbers have been declining in recent years. In 2020, experts estimate that there are just over 40,000 orcas left in the world, with some populations facing extinction.</p>

<p>The decline of the orca population can be attributed in part to human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction. Orcas are also often subject to capture for commercial or entertainment purposes, and their numbers have also been affected by fishing nets, oil spills, and climate change. As a result, many orca populations are now considered endangered or vulnerable.</p>

<p>The decline in the orca population has been particularly noticeable in the Pacific Northwest of North America, where the northern resident population has declined by nearly 25% in the last 10 years. This population has also been affected by the decline of their primary food source, Chinook salmon, which has been a result of overfishing and habitat destruction. </p>

<p>The decline of the orca population has led to increased conservation efforts in recent years, with many organizations working hard to protect these majestic animals. In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has created a "critical habitat" for orcas, which is a protected area where they can feed, breed, and rest. It is hoped that this protected habitat will help to rebuild orca populations in the years to come. </p>

<p>In addition to conservation efforts, organizations such as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) have also been working to raise awareness about the plight of orcas. Their campaigns focus on educating people about the threats facing orcas and how individuals can help to protect them. </p>

<h2>What Is The Major Threat To Orcas?</h2>

<p>The major threat to orcas is human activity. Overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction are all contributing factors to the decline in their population. Orcas are also often subject to capture for commercial or entertainment purposes, and their numbers have been further affected by fishing nets, oil spills, and climate change. </p>

<h2>How Can We Help Orcas?</h2>

<p>There are several ways that individuals can help to protect orcas. One way is to reduce our consumption of seafood, particularly fish that come from endangered or threatened populations. We can also support organizations that are working to protect orcas and their habitats, such as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. Finally, we can educate ourselves and others about the threats facing these majestic creatures, and spread the word about how we can all help to protect them. </p>

<h2>Are Orcas Endangered?</h2>

<p>Some orca populations are listed as endangered or vulnerable by international conservation organizations, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The northern resident population of orcas in the Pacific Northwest of North America is one of the most threatened populations, with their numbers declining by nearly 25% in the last 10 years. </p>

<h2>Are Orcas Endangered In Other Parts Of The World?</h2>

<p>Yes, orcas are endangered in other parts of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea and the Southern Ocean. These populations are threatened by human activities such as overfishing and pollution, as well as climate change. </p>

<h2>What Is Being Done To Protect Orcas?</h2>

<p>Conservation efforts are being undertaken to protect orcas and their habitats. In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has created a "critical habitat" for orcas, which is a protected area where they can feed, breed, and rest. Organizations such as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) are also working to raise awareness about the plight of orcas. </p>
