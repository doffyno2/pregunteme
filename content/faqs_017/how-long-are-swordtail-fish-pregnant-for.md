Swordtail fish are a type of freshwater fish that are popular among aquarium hobbyists. They have an elongated body and a distinctive tail shape that resembles a sword. Swordtails are native to Central America, and they can be seen in many different habitats, from shallow ponds to deep rivers.

Swordtail fish reproduce by internal fertilization. Male swordtails have an organ called a gonopodium, which is used to deliver sperm to the female. The female then stores the sperm in her body until she is ready to lay her eggs.
