<p>Teacup Yorkie dogs are a special breed of toy-sized Yorkshire Terriers, known for their small size, big personalities, and long lifespans. Yorkies, as they are affectionately known, are loyal lap dogs and make great companions for people of all ages. So, how long do teacup Yorkie dogs live?</p>

<p>The average lifespan of a teacup Yorkie is approximately 10 to 15 years. This is slightly longer than the average lifespan of regular-sized Yorkshire Terriers, which is around 12 to 15 years. It is important to note, however, that the lifespan of a teacup Yorkie is largely dependent on their health and lifestyle. Proper diet, exercise, and regular veterinary visits can help ensure that your pup lives a long and healthy life.</p>

<p>Teacup Yorkies are a fairly new breed of dog, and as such, there is limited research into their lifespan. However, research has shown that their small size does not necessarily equate to a shorter lifespan. In fact, several studies have found that the smaller size of the teacup Yorkie may lead to a longer life expectancy.</p>

<p>In addition to their size, the breed of a teacup Yorkie can also affect their longevity. For instance, some Yorkies are bred from purebred lines, while others are bred from mixed breeds. Purebred Yorkies tend to live longer than their mixed breed counterparts, as they are often healthier overall.</p>

<p>Another factor that can affect the lifespan of a teacup Yorkie is their health. It is important to ensure that your pup is given the proper nutrition, exercise, and veterinary care to ensure they are kept healthy throughout their lifetime. This can help to extend their lifespan by several years.</p>

<p>Finally, the environment in which a teacup Yorkie is raised can also play a role in their lifespan. If a pup is kept in an environment that is safe and healthy, they will likely live longer than those that are raised in more dangerous or unhealthy environments. Additionally, a teacup Yorkie that is properly socialized and receives adequate companionship can also live longer than one that is not.</p>
