<p>Global Entry is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection program that allows travelers from certain countries to bypass long lines at airports and other ports of entry. The program offers travelers a secure and convenient way to expedite their customs clearance process, and it is available to citizens of the United States and certain foreign nationals. To be eligible for Global Entry, travelers must pass an in-person interview and undergo a background check. Once approved, travelers are issued a Global Entry card that they can use to enter the United States. But how long does it take to get the Global Entry card after the interview?</p>

<h2>The Global Entry Interview</h2>

<p>The Global Entry interview is conducted by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer. During the interview, the officer will ask questions about the traveler’s background and travel history. The interview usually lasts about 15-30 minutes, and applicants will be notified at the end of the interview whether or not they are approved for the program. Applicants who are approved for Global Entry will receive a conditional approval letter and will be instructed to complete the enrollment process online. After the online enrollment process is complete, the traveler will be issued a Global Entry card.</p>

<h2>How Long Does it Take to Receive the Global Entry Card?</h2>

<p>The amount of time it takes to receive the Global Entry card after the interview varies depending on the applicant’s country of citizenship. Generally, U.S. citizens can expect to receive their cards within 7-10 business days after the interview. For non-U.S. citizens, the process may take longer, up to 30 business days. It is important to note that the Global Entry card will only be issued once the traveler has completed the online enrollment process.</p>

<h2>What to Do if You Don’t Receive Your Global Entry Card Within the Expected Time Frame</h2>

<p>If a traveler does not receive their Global Entry card within the expected time frame, they should contact U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The agency can provide more information about the status of the card and the expected delivery date. Travelers should also be aware that Global Entry cards are valid for five years from the date of issue. If the card is lost or stolen, travelers must contact U.S. Customs and Border Protection to request a replacement card.</p>
