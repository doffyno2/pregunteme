<p>When it comes to fitness trackers, Fitbit is one of the most recognized brands in the world. Not only do they make a wide range of affordable and stylish devices, they also offer some of the best customer service and warranties in the industry.</p>

This plan covers any defects in craftsmanship, materials, and assembly for the duration of the plan, and provides protection against accidental damage for the first year. It also includes a one-time replacement for any device that is accidentally damaged, lost, or stolen.</p>

<p>Fitbit also offers a 30 day money back guarantee and a 60 day return policy. This means that if you are not satisfied with your device, or if it is damaged, you can return it for a full refund or exchange within the specified time frame.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard warranty and return policies, Fitbit also offers a variety of customer service options. The company has an extensive online help center and forums, as well as a robust customer service team that can be contacted by phone, email, or live chat.</p>
