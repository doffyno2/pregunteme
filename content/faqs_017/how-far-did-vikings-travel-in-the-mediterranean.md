<p>Vikings were one of the most successful and feared raiders of the ancient world. Their name comes from the Old Norse word víkingr, meaning a pirate raid or expedition. During their raids, they often ventured far beyond their native Scandinavia, striking fear into the hearts of their victims in places as far away as France, Britain, and even the Mediterranean. But just how far did the Vikings travel in the Mediterranean?</p>

<h2>Viking Raids in the Mediterranean</h2>

<p>Viking raids in the Mediterranean began in the second half of the 8th century. They were primarily concentrated in coastal areas, such as the islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Viking raiders would often sail up rivers and attack inland settlements, such as the city of Rome. The Viking raids were so devastating that they prompted the Pope to launch a military response against them.</p>

<p>In the 9th century, the Vikings expanded their raids to the coasts of North Africa, such as Tunisia. They also sailed to the Levant and as far east as Constantinople. In the 10th century, they began raiding Spain, and even ventured into the Black Sea. By the 11th century, the Vikings had reached the coasts of modern-day Turkey, Croatia, and Greece.</p>

<h2>Viking Trade Routes in the Mediterranean</h2>

<p>In addition to raiding, the Vikings also ventured into the Mediterranean to trade. They used their ships to transport goods, such as slaves, weapons, and luxury items, between the different ports in the region. They also traded with the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople, as well as with North African and Middle Eastern merchants.</p>

<p>The Vikings established trading posts in the Mediterranean, such as in the port of Bari in Italy and the port of Hedeby in Denmark. They also used the port of Quentovic in France as a base for their Mediterranean operations. The Vikings traded with the Arabs, who provided them with weapons and luxury goods. They also traded with the Byzantines, who provided them with slaves and grain.</p>

<h2>Viking Settlements in the Mediterranean</h2>

<p>In addition to raiding and trading, the Vikings also established settlements in the Mediterranean. They founded the city of Dublin in Ireland and the city of Limerick in Ireland. In Sicily, they established the city of Palermo and the city of Catania. In Spain, they founded the cities of Barcelona and Valencia. In France, they established the cities of Rouen, Nantes, and Bordeaux.</p>

<p>The Vikings also established settlements in the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. On Cyprus, the Vikings established the city of Paphos, which became a major trading port. On Crete, they established the city of Candia, which became an important trading post in the Mediterranean. The Vikings also established settlements in the Balearic Islands, such as Minorca and Majorca.</p>
