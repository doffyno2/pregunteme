<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world. It is also one of the most competitive and entertaining sports leagues. One of the many rules of the NBA is the team foul rule. This rule dictates how many team fouls a team can commit before they are awarded a bonus. In this article, we will look at the team foul rule and how it works in the NBA.</p>

<h2>What is a Team Foul?</h2>

<p>A team foul is any illegal physical contact by a player on the court or by a coach or other personnel on the sidelines. Examples of team fouls include pushing, striking, holding, tripping, and illegal screens. Every team is allowed to commit a certain number of team fouls before they must start playing a different style of defense.</p>

<h2>How Many Team Fouls Before A Bonus?</h2>

<p>The number of team fouls before a bonus is different for each quarter in the NBA. During the first half, teams are allowed to commit five team fouls before a bonus is given to the other team. After the fifth team foul, the other team is awarded two free throws and possession of the ball. In the second half, teams are allowed to commit seven team fouls before a bonus is given to the other team. After the seventh team foul, the other team is awarded two free throws and possession of the ball.</p>

<h2>Does the Number of Team Fouls Reset at Halftime?</h2>

<p>The number of team fouls does not reset at halftime. The fouls carry over from the first half to the second half. So, if a team has committed four team fouls in the first half, they will start the second half with four team fouls.</p>

<h2>What Happens After Team Fouls Reach 10?</h2>

<p>Once a team has committed 10 team fouls in a game, the opposing team is awarded two free throws and possession of the ball. This is known as the double bonus. After the double bonus, the opposing team is awarded two free throws and possession of the ball after every additional team foul committed by the original team.</p>

<h2>What is a Penalty?</h2>

<p>A penalty is a penalty awarded to the opposing team after a certain number of team fouls have been committed. The penalty is awarded after a team has committed six team fouls in a quarter. The penalty gives the other team two free throws and possession of the ball.</p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between Team Fouls and Personal Fouls?</h2>

<p>Team fouls are fouls that are committed by a team as a whole. Personal fouls are fouls that are committed by an individual player. Personal fouls do not count towards the team foul limit and are not subject to team foul rules.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The team foul rule in the NBA is an important rule that teams must abide by. Teams are allowed to commit a certain number of team fouls before they must start playing a different style of defense. The number of team fouls before a bonus is different for each quarter in the NBA. Once a team has committed 10 team fouls in a game, the opposing team is awarded two free throws and possession of the ball. Team fouls are different from personal fouls, as personal fouls are committed by an individual player and do not count towards the team foul limit.</p>
