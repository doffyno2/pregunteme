A ultra marathon is one of the most demanding endurance events that an athlete can participate in. Though the exact length of an ultra marathon varies depending on the event, the general rule of thumb is that the race must measure at least 50 miles (80 kilometers). The exact distance varies from event to event, with some ultra marathons measuring as long as 200 miles (320 kilometers).
