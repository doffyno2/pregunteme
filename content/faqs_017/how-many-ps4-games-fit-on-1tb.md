<p>The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is one of the most popular gaming consoles, and it can hold up to 1TB of data. That’s a lot of space, so how many PS4 games can fit on 1TB? The answer depends on the type and size of the games you’re looking to store. </p>

<p>The size of a game can range from a few hundred megabytes to more than 50GB. A game like Minecraft, for example, is only about 1GB, while a game like Red Dead Redemption II is more than 90GB.

<h2>How to Fit More Games on a 1TB Hard Drive</h2>
