<p>For many pet owners, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of having a freshly poured concrete patio or driveway, but it’s important to keep your pup off of that new concrete for a certain amount of time. When it comes to finding out how long to keep dogs off new concrete, the answer can vary depending on the type of concrete used, the climate where you live, and the size of your pup. Here’s what you need to know when it comes to keeping your pup off of new concrete.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Keeping Dogs Off New Concrete</h2>

<p>The main reason why you’ll want to keep your pup off of new concrete is that it takes time for the concrete to cure and become strong. During the curing process, the concrete can be vulnerable to damage, and even the weight of your pup can affect the curing process. Additionally, if your pup steps on wet concrete, it can cause discoloration or even cause the concrete to crack.</p>

<h2>How Long to Keep Dogs Off New Concrete</h2>

<p>The answer to this question can vary depending on the type of concrete you use, the climate where you live, and the size of your pup. Generally, the time recommended to keep dogs off the concrete can range from three days to several weeks. Here’s a closer look at the factors that can affect the length of time that you should keep your pup off of the new concrete.</p>

<h3>Type of Concrete</h3>

<p>The type of concrete that you use can have an effect on how long you should keep your pup off of it. If you’re using a ready-mix concrete, you’ll want to keep your pup off of it for at least three days, and up to seven days. If you’re using a high-strength concrete, the time can be extended to four days to two weeks. Finally, if you’re using a hot-weather concrete, you’ll want to keep your pup off of it for up to five days.</p>

<h3>Climate</h3>

<p>The climate where you live can also affect the length of time that you should keep your pup off of new concrete. If you live in an area with hot, dry weather, you’ll want to keep your pup off of the new concrete for a longer period of time. On the other hand, if your area has cooler weather, you may not need to keep your pup off of the new concrete for as long. Generally, you should plan to keep your pup off of the new concrete for at least three days, and up to two weeks.</p>

<h3>Size of Pup</h3>

<p>The size of your pup can also affect the length of time that you should keep them off of the new concrete. Smaller pups will usually not cause as much damage to the new concrete, so you may not need to keep them off of it for as long. Larger pups, however, can cause more damage and should be kept off of the new concrete for a longer period of time.</p>

<h2>How to Keep Dogs Off Newly Poured Concrete</h2>

<p>Once you’ve determined how long you need to keep your pup off of the new concrete, you’ll need to take steps to make sure that they stay away. The best way to do this is to create a physical barrier that they can’t get past. You can use a fence or a gate to keep your pup away from the new concrete. Additionally, you can use a spray or a scent to deter your pup from the area. You can also provide your pup with other activities or toys to distract them from the new concrete.</p>
