Cigarettes are one of the most popular forms of tobacco consumption around the world. Despite numerous warnings and health campaigns, millions of people still smoke cigarettes regularly. But how many calories are in a cigarette?

<h2>What is a Cigarette?</h2>

A cigarette is a small cylinder of finely cut tobacco leaves rolled in thin paper for smoking. Most cigarettes contain a "reconstituted tobacco" product known as "sheet", which consists of "recycled [tobacco] stems, stalks, scraps, collected dust, and floor sweepings", to which are added glue, chemicals and fillers; the product is then sprayed with nicotine that was extracted from the tobacco scraps, and shaped into curls.

<h2>How Many Calories in a Cigarette?</h2>

One cigarette contains about 1-2 calories, depending on its size and the amount of tobacco contained within it. Since the nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes are not metabolized, they do not contribute to calorie intake. 

Therefore, smoking one cigarette will not make you gain weight, but smoking several cigarettes a day can contribute to weight gain over time due to the addition of calories from other sources. For example, a person who smokes one cigarette a day and eats an extra 500 calories per day (the equivalent of a high calorie meal) would gain an extra 4.5 pounds per year.

<h2>What are the Health Risks Associated with Smoking Cigarettes?</h2>

Smoking cigarettes is associated with numerous health risks, including an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and lung disease. Cigarette smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, including more than 70 known cancer-causing agents. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of lung cancer, throat cancer, and other cancers of the digestive system.

In addition to increasing the risk of cancer, smoking cigarettes can also cause other health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and lung disease. Smoking can also worsen existing health problems, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

<h2>Are There Healthier Alternatives to Smoking Cigarettes?</h2>

Yes, there are healthier alternatives to smoking cigarettes. Quitting smoking is the best way to reduce your risk of health problems associated with smoking. If you are unable to quit smoking, there are other options available to reduce your exposure to the harmful chemicals in cigarettes.

These options include switching to a smokeless tobacco product, such as snus, or using an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS), such as an e-cigarette. Both of these alternatives reduce the amount of harmful chemicals you are exposed to and can help you reduce or quit smoking altogether.
