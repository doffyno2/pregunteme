<p>Do you want to bring some extra firepower to your Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (5e) adventures? If so, you might be considering getting a riding horse. But before you do, it’s important to know how much a riding horse can carry, as this can make or break your adventure. In this article, we’ll take a look at the carrying capacity of a riding horse in 5e, as well as other important considerations when using one in your campaigns.</p>

<h2>What Is the Carrying Capacity of a Riding Horse in 5e?</h2>

<p>According to the 5th Edition Player’s Handbook, a riding horse can carry up to 400 pounds (181.4 kg). This means that if you’re looking to bring extra supplies on your adventures, such as armor, weapons, or food, you can count on your riding horse to do the heavy lifting. However, it’s important to note that this weight limit does not include the weight of the rider.</p>

<h2>What Are the Other Considerations for Using a Riding Horse?</h2>

<p>In addition to knowing how much a riding horse can carry, there are several other important considerations to keep in mind when using one in your 5e campaigns. For example, it’s important to think about the terrain you’ll be traveling through. If you’re trekking through rough terrain, a riding horse may not be the best choice, as it will require more energy to move through it. Additionally, it’s important to consider the size and weight of the rider. If the rider is too large or heavy, it can put too much strain on the horse and potentially cause injury.</p>

<h2>Are There Other Mounts That Can Carry More?</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a mount that can carry more than a riding horse, there are several other options available. For example, a heavy warhorse can carry up to 600 pounds (272.2 kg), while a draft horse can carry up to 800 pounds (363.1 kg). Additionally, if you’re looking for a mount that can carry even more weight, you can consider using a giant eagle, which can carry up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kg).</p>

<h2>How Do I Equip My Mount?</h2>

<p>In addition to knowing how much your mount can carry, it’s also important to know how to equip it. Fortunately, equipping your mount is fairly easy. All you need is a saddle, which can be purchased from most armorers or merchants. Once you’ve acquired a saddle, you can attach it to your mount and begin to equip it with other items, such as armor, weapons, and supplies. </p>

<h2>Can I Use My Mount as a Combatant?</h2>

<p>Yes, you can use your mount as a combatant in 5e. In fact, mounts can be an invaluable asset in combat, as they can provide an extra layer of protection for the rider, as well as an extra source of damage. Additionally, some mounts, such as horses and war horses, can be trained to attack opponents on command. This can be a great way to give your party an edge in combat.</p>
