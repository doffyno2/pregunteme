<p>The United States of America is composed of 50 states, plus the District of Columbia. Together, these 51 entities form the country that is the United States.

The nation's capital is Washington, DC, which is a federal district, not a state. </p>

<h2>History of US States</h2>

<p>The first 13 states to join the Union after the Revolutionary War were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These states formed the original United States of America. In the years since, 37 other states have been added to the Union. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, eight new states were added: Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Alabama, Maine, and Missouri. The Louisiana Purchase also brought a large part of the Louisiana Territory into the US, which is now divided into Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. In 1845, Texas joined the Union. Five states were added as a result of the Mexican-American War: California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. The last two states to join the Union were Alaska in 1959 and Hawaii in 1960. </p>

<h2>Political Divisions in the US</h2>

<p>In addition to the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the United States also includes five permanently inhabited territories: Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. These territories are not states, but the US Constitution applies to them and the inhabitants of these territories are US citizens. The US also has other territories, such as the Midway Islands, Wake Island, and several outlying islands, but these are uninhabited. </p>

<h2>State Symbols and Flags</h2>

<p>Each state in the US has its own flag and seal. The flags are flown over state buildings and monuments and are an important part of the state's history and identity. The state seal is used to authenticate documents issued by the state government. The state symbols also include a state bird, a state flower, and a state motto. </p>

<h2>State Governments</h2>

<p>Each state has its own system of government, with a governor and state legislature. The state legislatures are responsible for passing laws and appropriating funds for state programs. Each state also has its own court system, which is responsible for interpreting and enforcing state laws. </p>
