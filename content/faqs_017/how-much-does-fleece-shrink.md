Fleece is a popular fabric due to its softness, warmth, breathability, and durability. It is often used in clothing, blankets, and other items. Unfortunately, fleece is prone to shrinking after washing. In this article, we will discuss how much fleece shrinks and what you can do to minimize or prevent shrinking when washing your fleece garments.

<h2>What Is Fleece?</h2>

Fleece is a type of fabric made from polyester or other synthetic fibers. It is lightweight, breathable, and warm, making it a popular choice for garments like jackets, sweaters, and blankets. Fleece is also durable and able to withstand regular wear and tear.

<h2>How Much Does Fleece Shrink?</h2>

The amount of shrinkage that fleece experiences depends on the type of fabric and how it is washed. Generally speaking, fleece can shrink up to 10-15% in length and width. This is more likely to occur when the fleece is washed in hot water and dried at a high temperature.

<h2>What Causes Fleece To Shrink?</h2>

Fleece is susceptible to shrinking due to the nature of the fabric. The fibers in fleece are made up of tiny loops that are held together by heat-activated glue. When exposed to heat, the glue weakens and the loops can become disjointed, resulting in shrinkage.

<h2>How To Prevent Fleece From Shrinking</h2>

The best way to prevent fleece from shrinking is to wash it in cold water and air dry it. Additionally, you should avoid using fabric softener and harsh detergents, as they can also contribute to shrinking. If you must use a dryer, use the lowest heat setting possible and remove the garment as soon as it is dry.

<h2>What Should I Do If My Fleece Has Already Shrunk?</h2>

If your fleece has already shrunk, there are a few ways to restore it to its original size. One method is to place the garment in a sealed plastic bag and place it in the freezer overnight. The cold temperature will help to reset the fibers and reduce the amount of shrinkage. Another method is to fill a sink with lukewarm water and a few drops of mild detergent, then submerge the garment and agitate it gently. Once the garment has been agitated, rinse it in cold water, then lay it flat to dry.
