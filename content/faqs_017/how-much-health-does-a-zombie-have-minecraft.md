<p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game released in 2011 by Mojang. It has become incredibly popular over the years, with millions of players all around the world. One of the most popular features of the game is the ability to fight monsters and mobs, including the infamous zombie. But how much health does a zombie have in Minecraft?</p> 

<h2>What is a Zombie?</h2>

<p>A zombie is a hostile mob in Minecraft. They are tall and lanky, with pale skin and a greenish-yellow tint to their eyes. They typically spawn in dark areas, such as caves and swamps, though they can also be found in open areas during the day. Zombies will attack players and other mobs, and can also break down doors.</p>

<h2>How Much Health Does a Zombie Have?</h2>

<p>A zombie in Minecraft has 20 health points. This means that it takes 20 hits or attacks to kill a zombie. The zombieâ€™s health will also regenerate if it is not attacked for a certain period of time. Zombies are also immune to fire and lava, though they can be killed by them if they are exposed for too long.</p>

<h2>How to Defeat a Zombie</h2>

<p>The most effective way to defeat a zombie is to use a weapon. Weapons are the most efficient way to deal damage to a zombie, as they can be used to hit the zombie multiple times in a short period of time. Weapons such as swords, axes, and bows can all be used to attack a zombie. Other items such as potions and splash potions can also be used to damage or weaken a zombie.</p>

<h2>What Happens When a Zombie is Killed?</h2>

<p>When a zombie is killed, it will drop experience orbs and a random item. The item can be anything from a piece of armour to food, or even a rare item such as an enchanted book. The amount of experience orbs dropped depends on the level of the zombie, with higher level zombies dropping more experience orbs.</p>

<h2>What is Zombie Spawning?</h2>

<p>Zombie spawning is the process of creating a zombie in Minecraft. This can be done using the /summon command or by using a spawn egg. Zombie spawn eggs can be found in the creative inventory or in dungeon chests. Zombies can also spawn naturally in certain biomes, such as swamps and deserts.</p>

<h2>What are Zombie Villagers?</h2>

<p>Zombie villagers are a variant of the zombie mob. They have the same health as normal zombies, but they have a different appearance. Zombie villagers have a greenish tint to their skin and clothing, and their eyes are a dull gray colour. They can also spawn naturally in villages, and can be cured with a splash potion of weakness and a golden apple.</p>

<h2>What are Zombie Pigmen?</h2>

<p>Zombie pigmen are a variant of the zombie mob. They have 20 health points, just like zombies, but they have a different appearance.
