<p>Minecraft is an incredibly popular game that allows players to build structures, explore new worlds, and battle enemies. One of the most iconic enemies in the game is the creeper, a green, blocky-looking creature that explodes when it gets too close to a player or structure.</p>

<h2>What Are Health Points in Minecraft?</h2>

<p>When a creeper explodes, it also damages any blocks or creatures within a certain radius. This radius is determined by the game version, with the original version having a radius of 3 blocks, the Java Edition having a radius of 4 blocks, and the Bedrock Edition having a radius of 5 blocks.</p>
