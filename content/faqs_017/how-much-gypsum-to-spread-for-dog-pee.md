<p>Dogs are wonderful companions, but they can also be a source of frustration when it comes to dealing with their pee. Dog pee can cause damage to your lawn, leaving yellow spots and dead patches of grass. In order to prevent this damage, many pet owners turn to gypsum as a solution. Gypsum is a mineral that can be spread on your lawn to help neutralize the acidity of urine and return the pH balance to normal. But how much gypsum do you need to spread for dog pee?</p>

<h2>What is Gypsum?</h2>

<p>Gypsum is a mineral composed of calcium sulfate and water, with the chemical formula CaSO4 · 2H2O. It is found in a variety of forms, including alabaster, a fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum used for ornamental carvings. Gypsum is also used in construction, as a fertilizer, and as a soil amendment.</p>

<p>When applied to lawns, gypsum helps to neutralize the acidity of dog urine and restore the pH balance of the soil. This helps to ensure that your grass stays healthy and green. It also prevents the yellow spots that are caused by dog urine.</p>

<h2>How Much Gypsum to Spread for Dog Pee?</h2>

<p>The amount of gypsum you need to spread for dog pee depends on several factors, including the size of your lawn, the severity of the acidity of your soil, and the size of your dog. Generally, you should spread around 10-20 pounds of gypsum for every 1,000 square feet of lawn area. For example, if you have a 5,000 square foot lawn, you should spread around 50-100 pounds of gypsum.</p>

<p>It is important to note that gypsum should only be applied to areas affected by dog urine. Applying gypsum to the entire lawn can actually cause more harm than good, as it can disrupt the soil's natural pH balance. To ensure that you are applying the right amount of gypsum, it is best to have your soil tested first.</p>

<h2>How to Apply Gypsum to Your Lawn</h2>

<p>Once you have determined how much gypsum to spread for dog pee, you can begin the application process. First, you should water your lawn thoroughly. This will help the gypsum to spread more evenly. Next, spread the gypsum evenly across the affected area using a fertilizer spreader.</p>

<p>Once the gypsum has been applied, water the area again to help it absorb into the soil. You should also fertilize your lawn regularly to help keep it healthy and green. By following these steps, you can help to keep your lawn healthy and free from damage due to dog urine.</p>
