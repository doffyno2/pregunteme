<p>Lassie is one of the most iconic dogs of all time. The brave collie has been featured in books, movies, and television shows since the 1940s. But how many dogs actually played the role of Lassie?</p>

<p>The answer is surprisingly complicated. The original Lassie was a male Rough Collie named Pal, who made his film debut in 1943. He was owned and trained by Rudd Weatherwax, a dog trainer who worked in Hollywood. Pal was the only male dog ever to play the role of Lassie, and he played the role in seven movies and a television series. After Pal retired, Weatherwax trained his successor, a female Rough Collie named Mashed Potato. She was the first female dog to play the role of Lassie, and she played the role in the television series from 1954 to 1973.</p>

<p>After Mashed Potato retired, Weatherwax trained a third dog, a female Rough Collie named Hey Diddle Diddle. Hey Diddle Diddle played the role of Lassie from 1973 to 1975, when she was replaced by a fourth dog, a female Rough Collie named Old Mother Hubbard. Old Mother Hubbard played the role of Lassie from 1975 to 1978.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the Lassie franchise began to experiment with different breeds of dogs. In 1978, a female Golden Retriever named April was cast in the role of Lassie. April played the role until 1983, when she was replaced by a male Rough Collie named Rumble. Rumble played the role until 1984, when he was replaced by a female Rough Collie named Princess. Princess played the role until 1989, when she was replaced by a female Rough Collie named Chipper.</p>

<p>The cycle of Rough Collies playing the role of Lassie then continued until 1996, when a female Rough Collie named Lady replaced Chipper. Lady played the role until 2001, when she was replaced by a female Rough Collie named Shep. Shep played the role until 2005, when she was replaced by a female Rough Collie named Whitey. Whitey is currently the longest-running Lassie.</p>

<p>In total, 12 dogs have played the role of Lassie in the movies and television series. These include seven male Rough Collies, four female Rough Collies, and one female Golden Retriever. All of these dogs had one thing in common: they were owned and trained by Rudd Weatherwax, a legendary Hollywood animal trainer.</p>

<p>Lassie has been an iconic figure in popular culture for over 80 years. The brave collie has inspired generations of children and adults alike with her courage, loyalty, and intelligence. Her legacy will continue to live on for many years to come.</p>
