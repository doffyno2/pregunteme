<p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common health issues that can affect dogs. UTIs are caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract, causing inflammation and discomfort. Dogs with UTIs may show symptoms such as frequent urination, pain when urinating, and bloody or cloudy urine. If your dog is showing these symptoms, then your vet may recommend a UTI test to diagnose the problem. But how much does a dog UTI test cost?</p>

<p>The cost of a UTI test for a dog can vary depending on a variety of factors. Generally, the cost of a dog UTI test will range from $50 to $150. The exact cost will depend on the type of test being done, the veterinarian's fees, and the diagnostics used. In some cases, additional tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, which can add to the total cost.</p>

<h2>Types of UTI Tests for Dogs</h2>

A urinalysis can help to diagnose or rule out a UTI. Other tests that may be used include a urine culture, which looks for the presence of bacteria in the urine. This test is more accurate than a urinalysis, but it is also more expensive. Other tests, such as a urine sediment test, may also be used to look for signs of a UTI.</p>
