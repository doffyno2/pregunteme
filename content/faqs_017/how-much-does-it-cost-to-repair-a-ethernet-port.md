<p>Ethernet ports are an integral part of any computer or laptop. They are used to connect to the internet through your modem and router, allowing you to access the web, send and receive emails, and download and upload files. If the Ethernet port on your machine is not working correctly, it can be frustrating and can cause a lot of disruption for you. Fortunately, repairing an Ethernet port is usually quite straightforward and does not cost too much money.</p>

<h2>What Is an Ethernet Port?</h2>

The Ethernet port is also known as an RJ45 port, as it is typically connected to an Ethernet cable that uses an RJ45 plug. The Ethernet port is usually located on the back of the computer, near the USB ports.</p>
