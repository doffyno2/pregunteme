Every pet parent wants to keep their beloved furry friend safe and healthy. One of the best ways to do this is to protect them from fleas, ticks and other parasites. While flea and tick prevention medications are widely available, many pet owners are unsure of when to start giving their dog flea medication. In this article, we’ll provide an overview of how early you can start giving your dog flea medication and what factors you should consider before doing so.
