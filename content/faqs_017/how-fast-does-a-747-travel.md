The Boeing 747 is one of the world's most iconic aircraft. It is the first wide-body airliner ever built and is still in service today. The 747 has earned its place in aviation history as a reliable workhorse that is capable of carrying large numbers of passengers over long distances. But just how fast does a 747 travel?

<h2>What is the Maximum Speed of a Boeing 747?</h2>

The top speed of a Boeing 747 is Mach 0.86, or 570 mph (920 km/h). This is the maximum speed the aircraft can reach in level flight. The actual speed of a 747 in flight varies depending on the aircraft's weight, altitude, and weather conditions. In general, a fully-loaded 747 will cruise at a speed of around 500 mph (800 km/h).

<h2>How Fast Can a Boeing 747 Take Off?</h2>

The maximum takeoff speed of a 747 is around 150 knots (170 mph / 275 km/h). This is the speed the aircraft will reach just after lift-off. Once the aircraft is airborne, it will accelerate quickly to its maximum speed. The takeoff speed of a 747 depends on the aircraft's weight, altitude, and weather conditions.

<h2>What is the Cruising Speed of a Boeing 747?</h2>

The cruising speed of a 747 depends on the aircraft's weight, altitude, and weather conditions. In general, a fully-loaded 747 will cruise at a speed of around 500 mph (800 km/h). This is the speed the aircraft will maintain during its regular flight. At high altitudes, the aircraft can reach its maximum speed of 570 mph (920 km/h).

<h2>What is the Maximum Range of a Boeing 747?</h2>

The maximum range of a 747 is around 7,500 miles (12,000 km). This is the maximum distance the aircraft can fly without refueling. The actual range of the aircraft will depend on the aircraft's weight, altitude, and weather conditions. The 747 can fly further if it is carrying fewer passengers and less cargo.

<h2>What is the Maximum Altitude for a Boeing 747?</h2>

The maximum altitude for a 747 is around 45,000 feet (13,700 m). This is the highest altitude the aircraft can reach in level flight. The aircraft can climb to even higher altitudes if necessary, but this is not recommended as it can put a strain on the aircraft's engines.

<h2>What is the Typical Cruise Altitude of a Boeing 747?</h2>

The typical cruise altitude of a 747 is around 35,000 feet (10,670 m). This is the altitude the aircraft will fly at during its regular flight. The actual altitude of the aircraft will depend on the aircraft's weight, destination, and weather conditions.
