Rimadyl is an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication commonly prescribed to dogs for pain and inflammation associated with arthritis and other joint problems.

<h2>What is Rimadyl?</h2>

Rimadyl is the brand name of carprofen, a type of NSAID. NSAIDs are medications that reduce inflammation and pain. They work by blocking the production of substances in the body that cause inflammation and pain. Rimadyl is an over-the-counter medication that can be prescribed by a veterinarian. 

<h2>Dosage and Administration</h2>

Rimadyl is usually given to dogs in tablet or capsule form, once or twice a day. The recommended dosage is 0.5 to 4 mg per pound of body weight, depending on the condition being treated. It is important to follow your veterinarian’s instructions when giving your pet Rimadyl, as overdose can cause serious side effects.

The length of time that Rimadyl stays in a dog's system varies from dog to dog. Generally, Rimadyl can be detected in a dog's system for up to 24 hours after the last dose was administered. However, some dogs may metabolize the medication more quickly, and it may be detectable in their system for a shorter period of time. 

<h2>Side Effects</h2>

Rimadyl can cause side effects in some dogs. Common side effects include vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and stomach ulcers.
