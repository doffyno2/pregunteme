<p>Ringworm, also known as dermatophytosis, is a contagious fungal infection that can occur in both humans and animals. It is caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes. In dogs, ringworm is typically characterized by circular patches of hair loss on the skin. These patches may be itchy and inflamed, and they may be accompanied by scaly skin, redness, and crusting. In some cases, the patches may also contain pus or discharge.</p>

<p>Although ringworm is a highly contagious infection, it is typically not life-threatening. In fact, it is relatively easy to treat in dogs with the proper medication. However, it is important to know how long ringworm is contagious after starting treatment in order to ensure that the infection is properly contained and does not spread to other animals or people.</p>

<h2>What is Ringworm?</h2>

<p>Ringworm is a type of fungal infection that affects the skin, hair, and nails. It is caused by dermatophytes, which are a group of fungi that live on the dead outer layer of the skin, hair, and nails. The infection is typically characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin with a circle of missing hair. It is most common in puppies and cats, but it can affect any mammal.</p>

<p>In dogs, ringworm is usually spread through direct contact with an infected animal. It can also be spread through contact with contaminated bedding, grooming tools, or infected soil. In rare cases, humans may also contract ringworm from an infected dog, so it is important to be aware of the signs and to take preventive measures.</p>

<p>It is important to note that not all animals with ringworm will show signs of infection.
