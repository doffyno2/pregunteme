<p>An apple is a nutritious and delicious snack that provides many health benefits. Apples are a good source of dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are also low in calories and fat. But one nutrient they are not particularly high in is protein.</p>

<p>So, how many grams of protein does an apple have? The answer is not a lot. An average-sized apple (182 grams) contains only 0.36 grams of protein. That’s less than 1% of the recommended daily value.</p>

<p>But it’s important to note that the amount of protein in an apple can vary depending on the variety. For example, a Red Delicious apple contains 0.44 grams of protein, while a Golden Delicious apple contains 0.41 grams of protein. And an Apple Granny Smith contains 0.36 grams of protein. So, as you can see, there is some variation among the different types of apples.</p>

<p>In comparison to other fruits, apples are not particularly high in protein. For example, a medium banana has about 0.8 grams of protein and a medium pear has about 0.6 grams of protein. So, if you’re looking for a snack that contains more protein, you might want to opt for a banana or a pear instead of an apple.</p>

<p>But despite its low protein content, an apple is still a healthy snack. It is high in dietary fiber and contains a variety of vitamins and minerals. Plus, it is low in calories and fat, making it a great snack for weight loss.</p>

<h2>Are Apples a Good Source of Protein?</h2>

<p>Although apples contain some protein, they are not a good source of protein. As mentioned earlier, an average-sized apple (182 grams) contains only 0.36 grams of protein. This is less than 1% of the recommended daily value.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a good source of protein, you should opt for foods that are higher in protein such as eggs, nuts, legumes, and lean meats. These foods provide much more protein than an apple.</p>

<h2>Are Apples a Complete Protein?</h2>

<p>No, apples are not a complete protein. A complete protein is a food that contains all nine essential amino acids. Essential amino acids cannot be produced by the body, so they must be obtained through food. Apples do not contain all nine essential amino acids, so they are not a complete protein.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a complete protein, you should opt for animal-based proteins such as eggs, dairy, and meat. These foods contain all nine essential amino acids.</p>

<h2>Are Apples a Good Protein Source for Vegetarians?</h2>

<p>No, apples are not a good protein source for vegetarians. As mentioned earlier, apples contain very little protein. So, if you’re looking for a good protein source, you should opt for other vegetarian-friendly foods such as legumes, nuts, and seeds.</p>

<p>Legumes, nuts, and seeds are all good sources of plant-based proteins. For example, a ½ cup serving of cooked lentils contains 8.5 grams of protein and a ¼ cup of almonds contains 6.5 grams of protein. So, if you’re looking for a good vegetarian protein source, you should opt for these types of foods instead of apples.</p>
