Eggs are among the most popular sources of protein and nutrition, but when it comes to carbohydrates, the answer isnâ€™t so straightforward. While eggs do contain a small amount of carbohydrates, the exact number of carbs in an egg can vary depending on the size and type of egg. 

<h2>Carbohydrates in Whole Eggs</h2>

Whole eggs contain 0.4 grams of carbohydrates per large egg. This amount is significantly lower than other protein sources, such as beef and chicken, which can contain up to 5 grams of carbohydrates per serving. This makes whole eggs a great choice for those who are following a low-carbohydrate diet. 

<h2>Carbohydrates in Egg Whites</h2>

Egg whites contain almost no carbohydrates, with only 0.06 grams per large egg. This makes them an ideal choice for those who are trying to cut back on their carbohydrate intake. Egg whites are also a great source of protein, with 4.5 grams per large egg. 

<h2>Carbohydrates in Egg Yolks</h2>

Egg yolks contain a slightly higher amount of carbohydrates than the whites, with 0.1 grams per large egg. While this may seem like a small amount, it still makes them a better choice than other sources of protein, such as beef or chicken, which can contain up to 5 grams of carbohydrates per serving. Egg yolks are also a great source of healthy fats, with 4.3 grams per large egg. 

<h2>Carbohydrates in Cooked Eggs</h2>

Cooked eggs contain a slightly higher amount of carbohydrates than raw eggs, with 0.5 grams per large egg. This is due to the fact that some of the carbohydrates are lost during the cooking process. However, this is still a much lower amount than other sources of protein, such as beef or chicken, which can contain up to 5 grams of carbohydrates per serving. 

<h2>Carbohydrates in Powdered Eggs</h2>

Powdered eggs contain the highest amount of carbohydrates, with 1.5 grams per large egg. This is due to the fact that powdered eggs contain added ingredients, such as sugar, which increase the carbohydrate content. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Eggs are an excellent source of protein, but when it comes to carbohydrates, the amount can vary depending on the type of egg. Whole eggs contain 0.4 grams of carbohydrates per large egg, while egg whites contain 0.06 grams and egg yolks contain 0.1 grams. Cooked eggs contain 0.5 grams of carbohydrates per large egg, and powdered eggs contain 1.5 grams.
