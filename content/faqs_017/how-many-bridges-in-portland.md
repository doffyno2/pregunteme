Portland, the largest city in Oregon, is a beautiful and vibrant city known for its strong sense of community, unique cultural attractions, and stunning natural beauty. The city is also home to an impressive number of bridges, which make it easy to traverse the Willamette River and other waterways that crisscross the city. But just how many bridges are there in Portland?

The answer to this question depends on how you choose to define a bridge. Portland has more than 40 bridges that span the Willamette River and its tributaries, but the city also has several smaller bridges, such as the Sellwood Bridge, which is a pedestrian bridge and the Hawthorne Bridge, which is an automobile bridge. In addition, Portland also has two footbridges, the Steel Bridge and the Broadway Bridge, which cross the Willamette River.

<h2>The History of Portland's Bridges</h2>

The first bridge to span the Willamette River was the Hawthorne Bridge, which opened in 1910. This bridge was the first major bridge to cross the river, and it was a major engineering feat for its time. The Hawthorne Bridge was eventually followed by the Steel Bridge, which was built in 1912. Both of these bridges remain in use today and are two of Portland's most iconic bridges.

The Steel Bridge, which is the only double-deck bridge in Portland, is also notable for its unique design, which includes a lift span that can be raised and lowered to accommodate large ships. The Broadway Bridge, which opened in 1913, was the next major bridge to span the Willamette River. The Broadway Bridge was followed by the Burnside Bridge, which opened in 1926.

<h2>The Modern Bridges of Portland</h2>

In the decades since the opening of the Burnside Bridge, several other bridges have been built to span the Willamette River and its tributaries. These bridges include the Morrison Bridge, the Fremont Bridge, the Sellwood Bridge, the St. Johns Bridge, and the Ross Island Bridge. The Marquam Bridge and the Tilikum Crossing are two of the more recent additions to Portland's bridges.

The Marquam Bridge, which opened in 1966, is the highest bridge in Portland and is the only bridge in the city that carries Interstate 5. The Tilikum Crossing, which opened in 2015, is the first bridge to cross the Willamette River and does not carry any motorized vehicles.
