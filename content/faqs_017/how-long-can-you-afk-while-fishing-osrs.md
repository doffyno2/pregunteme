When a player is AFK, they are not interacting with the game in any way, and it is assumed that they are doing something else in real life. AFK fishing is when a player sets up a fishing spot, and then leaves their computer while the fishing spot is still active.

<h2>What Are the Risks of AFK Fishing?</h2>
