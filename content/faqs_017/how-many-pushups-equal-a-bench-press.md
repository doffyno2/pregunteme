<p>The answer to the question of how many pushups equal a bench press depends on a variety of factors. The amount of weight lifted, the number of reps, the position of the body, and the type of pushup all contribute to the overall comparison. As such, a definitive answer is difficult to provide.</p>

<h2>Weight</h2>

<p>The amount of weight lifted is the primary factor in determining how many pushups equal a bench press. It is important to note that pushups are a bodyweight exercise while bench presses use external weight in the form of a barbell or dumbbells. Therefore, a pushup will never equal a bench press in terms of the amount of weight lifted. However, the amount of weight lifted can be adjusted to create a comparison. For example, if a person is performing a pushup with a weight belt and the person performing the bench press is lifting a barbell weighing the same amount, then the two exercises could be considered equivalent.</p>

<h2>Reps</h2>

<p>The number of reps is also an important factor in determining how many pushups equal a bench press. Generally, the more reps a person can do with a given weight, the greater the number of pushups that will equal a bench press. However, it is important to note that the number of reps is not the only factor to consider. A person may be able to do more pushups than a bench press with the same weight but still not be able to lift as much weight with the pushups as with the bench press.</p>

<h2>Position</h2>

<p>The position of the body is also important in determining how many pushups equal a bench press. Generally, the closer the body is to the floor, the more pushups it will take to equal a bench press. For example, if a person is performing a pushup with their feet elevated, it will take more pushups to equal a bench press than if the person is performing a pushup with their feet on the floor.</p>

<h2>Type of Pushup</h2>

<p>The type of pushup also plays a role in determining how many pushups equal a bench press. Different types of pushups require different amounts of strength and coordination, and thus require a different number of reps to equal a bench press. For example, a wide grip pushup may require more reps than a narrow grip pushup in order to equal a bench press.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the answer to the question of how many pushups equal a bench press depends on a variety of factors. The amount of weight lifted, the number of reps, the position of the body, and the type of pushup all contribute to the overall comparison. As such, a definitive answer is difficult to provide.</p>
