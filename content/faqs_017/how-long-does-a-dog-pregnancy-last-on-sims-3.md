<p>The answer to this question depends on the type of dog that you have in your game of Sims 3. Some breeds of dogs have longer pregnancies than others, and this is important to know when you are trying to plan out the life cycle of your virtual pet. In this article, we will take a look at how long a dog pregnancy typically lasts in Sims 3 and discuss some of the things you should consider when trying to figure out the best time to breed your virtual dog.</p>

<h2>What Are The Average Pregnancy Lengths Of Different Dog Breeds?</h2>

<p>The average length of pregnancy in dogs is around 63 days, but there is some variation between different breeds. Smaller breeds, such as Chihuahuas, tend to have shorter pregnancies, while larger breeds, such as Great Danes, tend to have longer pregnancies.

If your dog is older or has health problems, it is possible that their pregnancy may be a bit shorter or longer than the average.</p>
