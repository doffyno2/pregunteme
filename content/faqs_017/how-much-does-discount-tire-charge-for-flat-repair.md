<h2>What is Flat Tire Repair?</h2>

<p>Flat tire repair is the process of fixing a tire that has been punctured or otherwise damaged. This can be done by patching the tire from the inside or by replacing the tire entirely. The type of repair that is needed will depend on the size of the hole in the tire, as well as the type of tire and the damage that has been done. Discount Tire offers both patching and tire replacement services.</p>

<h2>How Much Does Flat Tire Repair Cost?</h2>

<p>The cost of flat tire repair will depend on the type of repair that is needed. For patching, the cost can range from $20 to $50, depending on the size of the hole and the type of tire. For a tire replacement, the cost can range from $50 to $100, depending on the type of tire that is needed. Discount Tire also offers additional services such as wheel alignment, tire balancing, and tire rotation, which can add to the cost of the repair.</p>

<h2>What Should I Expect When Getting a Flat Tire Repaired?</h2>

<p>When you bring your vehicle to Discount Tire for a flat tire repair, the technicians will inspect the tire to determine the type of repair or replacement that is needed.
