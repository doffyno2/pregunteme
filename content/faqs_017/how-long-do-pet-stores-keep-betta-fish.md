Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are a popular choice for pet owners who want to add a little color to their home. They are also relatively easy to care for, making them an ideal choice for novice fish keepers. But one of the biggest questions that comes up for potential pet owners is how long do pet stores keep betta fish? 

This is an important question to answer before making the decision to purchase a betta fish, as it could have an effect on the health and well-being of the fish. In this article, we'll take a look at how long pet stores typically keep betta fish and what to look for when buying a betta fish from a store. 

<h2>How Long Do Pet Stores Keep Betta Fish?</h2>

In general, pet stores keep betta fish for around two to three weeks. This may vary depending on the store, as some may keep them for longer or shorter periods of time. It's important to be aware of this before buying a betta fish, as it could have a direct effect on the fish's health and well-being. 

When a betta fish is kept in a store, it is usually kept in a small tank with no filter or heater. This means that the water quality can quickly become poor, which can lead to health problems for the betta. Additionally, the betta may not be getting enough food, resulting in malnutrition. 

<h2>What to Look For When Buying a Betta Fish from a Store</h2>

If you are looking to buy a betta fish from a pet store, there are a few things you should look for before making your purchase. 

First and foremost, you should look for a tank that is the appropriate size for the betta. Betta fish need at least two gallons of water, so make sure the tank is at least that size. Additionally, make sure the tank has a filter and a heater, as these are essential for the health and well-being of the betta. 

Another important factor to consider is the water quality. You should inspect the tank to make sure the water is clean and clear. If the water is cloudy or has an odor, the betta may be suffering from poor water quality. 

Finally, you should check to make sure the betta is eating. If the betta is not eating, it could be a sign of poor health or malnutrition. 

<h2>Tips for Caring for a Betta Fish</h2>

Once you have purchased a betta fish from a pet store, it's important to make sure you are providing the best care possible. Here are a few tips for keeping your betta healthy and happy: 

<h3>Provide the Right Environment</h3>
