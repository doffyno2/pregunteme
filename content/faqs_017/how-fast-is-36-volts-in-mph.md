<p>The speed of 36 volts electric motor is measured in miles per hour (MPH), and it can vary depending on the type of motor and its configuration. In general, 36 volts motors are used for applications such as electric bikes, electric scooters, and electric vehicles. The speed of 36 volts electric motor can range from 10-50 MPH depending on the power of the motor and the terrain. </p>

<h2>Electric Bike Speed</h2>

<p>Electric bikes are the most common type of electric motor powered by 36 volts. Depending on the power of the motor and the terrain, an electric bike can travel up to 15-20 MPH on flat ground. On hills, the speed decreases depending on the grade of the hill. In general, electric bikes are designed to provide comfortable and leisurely rides, so they are not designed for speed.</p>

<h2>Electric Scooter Speed</h2>

<p>The speed of 36 volts electric scooters is higher than that of electric bikes because they have larger and more powerful motors. Electric scooters typically reach speeds of 20-30 MPH on flat ground. On hills, the speed can range from 10-20 MPH depending on the grade of the hill and the power of the motor. Electric scooters are designed for short trips and short commutes, and their speed is adequate for most riders.</p>

<h2>Electric Vehicle Speed</h2>

<p>Electric vehicles powered by 36 volts motors can reach speeds of up to 50 MPH on flat ground. On hills, the speed can range from 30-50 MPH depending on the grade of the hill and the power of the motor. Electric vehicles are designed for long-distance travel, and their speed is adequate for most drivers.</p>

<h2>How to Increase the Speed of Your Electric Vehicle</h2>

<p>If you want to increase the speed of your electric vehicle powered by 36 volts motors, there are several things you can do. First, you can increase the power of your motor by adding more batteries or investing in a more powerful motor. Second, you can reduce the weight of your vehicle by investing in lightweight components such as carbon fiber wheels and a lightweight frame. Finally, you can invest in a performance controller that will allow you to adjust the speed and power of your motor. </p>
