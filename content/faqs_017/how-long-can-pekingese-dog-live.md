Pekingese dogs are popular companion animals that can live for many years. But how long exactly? That depends on a few factors that can affect the lifespan of these small, lovable dogs. In this article, we'll explore the average lifespan of Pekingese dogs and what influences it. We'll also discuss how to help your pet live a long, healthy life.

<h2>Average Lifespan of a Pekingese Dog</h2>

The average lifespan of a Pekingese dog is between 10 and 12 years. This is slightly lower than the average lifespan of other small breeds, which is closer to 13-15 years. Of course, individual dogs of any breed can live longer or shorter depending on their health, diet, and lifestyle.

<h2>Factors that Influence the Lifespan of a Pekingese Dog</h2>

To ensure your pet lives a long, healthy life, be sure to take them for regular check-ups and provide them with a balanced diet and adequate exercise. 

<h3>Diet</h3>

A balanced diet is essential for any dog, but it is especially important for Pekingese dogs. These small dogs are prone to obesity, so it's important to provide them with a diet that is rich in protein and low in fat.

Genetics can also play a role in determining the lifespan of a Pekingese dog. Some dogs are genetically predisposed to certain diseases or health conditions, which can shorten their lifespan. If you are considering buying a Pekingese puppy, be sure to research the breed and ask the breeder questions about the parents' health and genetics.
