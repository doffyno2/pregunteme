<p>T-Rex, or Tyrannosaurus rex, was one of the most impressive dinosaurs to have ever lived. It was a giant predator, capable of reaching up to 12 meters in length and weighing up to 7 tonnes. But exactly how much did a T-Rex weigh? Let's find out.</p>

<h2>What is the Average Weight of a T-Rex?</h2>

<p>The average weight of a T-Rex is estimated to be between 5.4 and 7.3 tonnes. However, this number is an approximation, as the weight of individual T-Rex specimens can vary greatly. For example, the largest known T-Rex skeleton, unearthed in Alberta, Canada in 2020, was estimated to weigh 9.3 tonnes.</p>

<h2>How Did Scientists Estimate the Weight of a T-Rex?</h2>

<p>To estimate how much a T-Rex weighed, scientists looked at the size of its bones and muscle attachments. By studying these characteristics and comparing them to those of other, closely related species, they were able to come up with an estimate of how much a T-Rex weighed. They also looked at the size of the T-Rex's footprints, and estimated its weight based on the size of its feet.</p>

<h2>What Was the Heaviest Recorded T-Rex?</h2>

<p>The heaviest recorded T-Rex was the one unearthed in Alberta, Canada in 2020. This specimen was estimated to have weighed 9.3 tonnes. However, it is important to note that this is an estimate, and the actual weight of this T-Rex could have been slightly higher or lower.</p>

<h2>What Was the Lightest Recorded T-Rex?</h2>

<p>The lightest recorded T-Rex was the one unearthed in Montana, USA in 1997. This specimen was estimated to have weighed 4.1 tonnes. Again, this is an estimate, and the actual weight of this T-Rex could have been slightly higher or lower.</p>

<h2>How Much Does a T-Rex Weigh Compared to Other Dinosaurs?</h2>

<p>T-Rex is one of the heaviest known dinosaurs, weighing up to 7.3 tonnes. This is much heavier than other large predators, such as the Allosaurus, which weighed up to 4 tonnes. It is also much heavier than other large herbivores, such as the Diplodocus, which weighed up to 5.5 tonnes.</p>

<h2>Would a Human Be Able to Lift a T-Rex?</h2>

<p>No, it would be impossible for a human to lift a T-Rex. This is because the average human can only lift up to 200 kg, while a T-Rex can weigh up to 7.3 tonnes. Even if the T-Rex was a baby, it would still be too heavy for a human to lift.</p>

<h2>What Was the Diet of a T-Rex?</h2>

<p>T-Rex was a predator and a scavenger, meaning that it ate both live prey and the corpses of dead animals. Its diet likely included large plant-eating dinosaurs, such as the Triceratops and the Brontosaurus, as well as small animals such as lizards and insects.</p>
