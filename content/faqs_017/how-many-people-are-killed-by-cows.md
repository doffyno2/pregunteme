Cows may not seem like a particularly dangerous animal, but in reality, they can cause a lot of harm if not handled with caution. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cows are responsible for more deaths than any other animal in the United States. In this article, we'll explore how many people are killed by cows, why cows are so dangerous, and what can be done to reduce the risk of cow-related fatalities. 

<h2>How Many People are Killed by Cows? </h2>

Data from the CDC shows that between 2003 and 2019, there have been a total of 101 cow-related fatalities in the United States. During this time period, an average of five deaths occurred each year, with a low of one death in 2018 and a high of 11 deaths in 2005. The majority of these fatalities were caused by beef cattle, with dairy cattle responsible for the remaining deaths. 

<h2>Why are Cows So Dangerous?</h2>

Cows may seem docile and harmless, but they can become aggressive when provoked or startled. Cows can kick, charge, and headbutt, and their horns can cause serious injuries. In addition, cows can easily knock a person off balance, and if the person falls, they can be trampled or crushed by the cow. Cows can also become agitated and stampede, which can lead to injuries and fatalities. 

<h2>What Can Be Done to Reduce the Risk of Cow-Related Fatalities?</h2>

The best way to reduce the risk of cow-related fatalities is to take precautions when handling cows. It's important to be aware of the cow's behavior and to avoid startling or agitating them. If you must work with cattle, wear protective gear such as a hard hat, boots, and eye protection. It's also important to keep a safe distance from the cows, and not to approach them from behind or from the side. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Cows may not seem like a dangerous animal, but they are responsible for more deaths than any other animal in the United States. It's important to be aware of the risks associated with cows, and to take the necessary precautions when handling them. By following these safety tips, you can reduce the risk of cow-related fatalities.
