<p>Slow cookers, also known as crock pots, are a great way to prepare meals with minimal effort. They are easy to use, require no attention while cooking, and can be used to cook a variety of dishes from stews to soups to desserts. But how much power do they use? Specifically, how many amps does a crock pot draw?</p>

<p>The answer is not as simple as you might think. The amount of current a slow cooker draws depends on its wattage rating, and the wattage rating of a slow cooker can vary widely. A small, basic slow cooker may have a rating of 200 watts, while a large, high-end model may have a rating of 800 watts or more. To figure out how many amps a slow cooker will draw, you need to know its wattage rating and the voltage of the power supply it's connected to.</p>

<h2>How to Calculate Amps Drawn by a Crock Pot</h2>

<p>The formula for determining the amps drawn by a device is simple: Amps = Watts / Volts. For example, if you have a slow cooker with a wattage rating of 500 watts, and it's connected to a 120-volt power supply, the calculation would look like this: Amps = 500 Watts / 120 Volts = 4.17 Amps.</p>

<p>It's important to note that this formula will only work if the wattage rating and voltage of the power supply are known. If either of these values is unknown, you won't be able to accurately calculate the amps drawn by the slow cooker.</p>

<h2>How Much Power Does a Crock Pot Use?</h2>

<p>A slow cooker uses a relatively small amount of power. A basic slow cooker with a wattage rating of 200 watts will draw approximately 1.66 amps from a 120-volt power supply. A high-end slow cooker with a wattage rating of 800 watts will draw approximately 6.66 amps from a 120-volt power supply.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the wattage rating of a slow cooker can vary widely, even among models of the same size. Before purchasing a slow cooker, check the wattage rating to make sure it will not draw too much power from your power supply.</p>

<h2>What Size Circuit Breaker Does a Crock Pot Require?</h2>

<p>The size of the circuit breaker required for a slow cooker will depend on its wattage rating. For a slow cooker with a wattage rating of 200 watts, the circuit breaker should be rated for 15 amps. For a slow cooker with a wattage rating of 800 watts, the circuit breaker should be rated for 30 amps.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the circuit breaker should be rated for the full wattage rating of the slow cooker. If the circuit breaker is rated for less than the wattage rating of the slow cooker, it may not be able to handle the load.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Q. How many amps does a crock pot pull?</h3>

<h3>Q. How do you calculate amps drawn by a crock pot?</h3>

<p>The formula for determining the amps drawn by a device is simple: Amps = Watts / Volts. For example, if you have a slow cooker with a wattage rating of 500 watts, and it's connected to a 120-volt power supply, the calculation would look like this: Amps = 500 Watts / 120 Volts = 4.17 Amps.</p>

<h3>Q. What is the difference between watts and amps?</h3>

<p>Watts and amps measure different properties of electricity. Watts measure the amount of power that an electrical device uses, while amps measure the amount of electrical current that flows through a circuit. The amount of current drawn by a device is determined by its wattage rating, and the voltage of the power supply it's connected to.</p>

<h3>Q. Is it safe to use a crock pot on a 15 amp circuit?</h3>

<p>Yes, it is generally safe to use a slow cooker on a 15 amp circuit, as long as the wattage rating of the slow cooker is 200 watts or less. If the wattage rating is higher than 200 watts, you should use a circuit breaker rated for 30 amps.</p>

<h3>Q. Can you use a crock pot on a GFCI outlet?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can use a slow cooker on a GFCI outlet, as long as the wattage rating of the slow cooker is 200 watts or less. If the wattage rating is higher than 200 watts, you should use a GFCI outlet rated for 30 amps.</p>

<h3>Q. How do I know what wattage my crock pot is?</h3>

<p>The wattage rating of a slow cooker can usually be found on the device itself, or on the packaging it came in. It may also be listed in the manual or online. If you can't find the wattage rating, you should contact the manufacturer for more information.</p>

<h3>Q. Is it safe to leave a crock pot on all day?</h3>

<p>Yes, it is generally safe to leave a slow cooker on all day. However, it is important to make sure that the slow cooker is in a safe location, away from children and pets, and that it is not left unattended for extended periods of time.</p>

<h3>Q. Can you cook raw meat in a crock pot?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can cook raw meat in a slow cooker. However, it is important to make sure that the meat is cooked thoroughly before serving. The internal temperature of the meat should reach at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit in order to be safe to eat.</p>

<h3>Q. Can a crock pot cause a fire?</h3>

<p>Yes, in rare cases, a slow cooker can cause a fire. This is usually due to improper use, such as leaving the slow cooker unattended for extended periods of time, or using too much oil or other flammable liquids. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions when using a slow cooker to avoid potential fire hazards.</p>

<h3>Q. How often should you clean a crock pot?</h3>

<p>It is recommended that you clean your slow cooker after each use. This will help prevent the buildup of food residue, which can lead to food-borne illnesses. It is also important to check the rubber seal on the lid for any cracks or tears, which could lead to steam escaping and potentially causing a fire.</p>
