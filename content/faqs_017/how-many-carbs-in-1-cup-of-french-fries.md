<p>French fries are a classic side dish, enjoyed by many people around the world. But how many carbs are in a cup of french fries? </p>

<p>It turns out that the answer depends on the type of french fries you are eating. Freshly-made french fries, for example, contain a relatively high amount of carbohydrates, usually around 19 grams per cup. On the other hand, frozen french fries contain only about 6 grams of carbs per cup. </p>

<p>The carbohydrates in french fries come mainly from the potatoes themselves. Potatoes are a starchy vegetable, meaning they contain more carbohydrates than other vegetables. This means that french fries are not a low-carb food, even though they are cooked in oil. </p>

<p>The amount of carbohydrates in french fries also depends on how they are cooked. Deep-fried french fries, for example, contain more carbohydrates than oven-baked french fries. This is because the oil used to deep-fry the potatoes absorbs some of the carbohydrates, resulting in higher carb counts. </p>

<p>In addition to carbs, french fries also contain other nutrients, such as protein, fat, and fiber. A cup of french fries contains around 6 grams of protein, 8 grams of fat, and 2 grams of fiber. While french fries are not the healthiest food, they can be enjoyed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>
