<h2>What is an Automatic Watch?</h2>

An automatic watch is a watch that runs without the need for manual winding. It uses the energy produced by the wearer’s body movement to power the watch. The motion of the wearer’s arm winds a rotor inside the watch, which then stores energy in the mainspring. This energy is then used to power the watch. Automatic watches are often considered more accurate than manual-winding watches as they are self-regulating, meaning they can adjust to changes in temperature or barometric pressure.

<h2>How Does an Automatic Watch Work?</h2>

The automatic watch consists of two main components: the movement and the rotor. The movement is the mechanism which sets the watch and keeps it running. The rotor is a metal weight which turns as the wearer moves their arm, winding the mainspring. This mainspring stores the energy from the wearer’s body movement and is then used to power the watch.

<h2>Why Do Automatic Watches Need Repair?</h2>

Automatic watches are delicate and complex pieces of machinery and require regular maintenance and repair in order to keep them running accurately. Over time, dirt, dust and other debris can build up inside the watch, causing it to run inefficiently or even stop. In addition, the mainspring can become worn out or broken, resulting in the watch losing its ability to store energy. Without regular maintenance and repair, an automatic watch will eventually stop working.

<h2>What Are Common Repairs Needed for Automatic Watches?</h2>

Common repairs for automatic watches include cleaning, lubrication and adjustment of the movement and rotor, as well as replacing worn or broken parts. The watch may also need to be adjusted for time accuracy, barometric pressure and temperature. In addition, if the watch has been damaged, the case, crystal and band may need to be repaired or replaced.

<h2>How Much Does Automatic Watch Repair Cost?</h2>

The cost of repairing an automatic watch will depend on the type of repair needed and the complexity of the repair. Generally, cleaning and lubrication of the movement and rotor will cost between $50 and $100. Replacing a broken mainspring can cost between $75 and $150. Replacing a damaged case, crystal or band will cost between $50 and $200. Adjusting a watch for time accuracy and barometric pressure can cost between $75 and $150.

<h2>How Can I Find a Watch Repair Professional?</h2>

It is important to find a qualified watch repair professional to work on your watch. Many watch repair professionals have a combination of formal training and experience in watchmaking. You may be able to find a watch repair professional in your area by searching online for “watch repair near me” or “watchmaker”. You can also ask friends and family for recommendations. 

<h2>What Should I Look for in a Watch Repair Professional?</h2>

When looking for a watch repair professional, you should look for someone with experience in the type of repair you need. You should also look for someone who is a member of a professional watchmakers association, such as the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute (AWCI). This will ensure that the watchmaker has the necessary skills and knowledge to complete the repair. Lastly, you should make sure that the watchmaker has a good reputation and can provide references from past customers.
