In this article, we’ll take a look at the cost of winterizing your camper, what’s involved in winterizing, and how to save money on the process.



Winterizing your camper is the process of preparing your RV for the cold winter season.

The winterization process involves a range of activities, depending on the type of camper. Generally, the process involves draining the water system, adding antifreeze, and protecting against cold air.

<h2>Draining the Water System</h2>

The first step in winterizing your camper is to drain the water system. This involves draining the fresh water tank, the hot water tank, and any other water holding tanks. This should be done with a drain hose and an appropriate antifreeze.
