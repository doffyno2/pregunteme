<p>If you have a pet dog, you know how persistent they can be when it comes to digging. While it can be a fun activity for your pup, it can be quite damaging to your lawn or garden. Fortunately, there is a way to prevent digging without resorting to extreme measures – using chicken wire.</p>

<p>Chicken wire is a type of fencing made up of hexagonal wires that are woven together. It’s often used to contain chickens or other poultry, but it can also be used to keep your dog from digging in your yard and garden.</p>

<p>There are several advantages to using chicken wire to prevent your pup from digging. It’s easy to install, and it’s not expensive. You can purchase it in rolls at your local hardware store or home improvement center. It’s also lightweight and easy to work with. You can even cut it to fit your yard’s size and shape.</p>

<h2>How to Install Chicken Wire to Stop Dogs Digging</h2>

<p>Installing chicken wire is relatively easy. Before you start, you should measure the area you want to fence off. This will help you determine how much chicken wire you need to buy. Once you have the measurements, you can purchase the appropriate amount of chicken wire.</p>

<p>Once you have the chicken wire, you’ll need to decide how you want to install it. You can either bury it in the ground or attach it to posts. If you choose to bury it, dig a trench around the area you want to fence off. Lay the chicken wire in the trench and cover it with soil. Make sure the chicken wire is securely in place and that no gaps remain. If you choose to attach it to posts, you can use wood or metal posts, depending on your preference. You’ll need to use wire or zip ties to secure the chicken wire to the posts.</p>

<p>Once the chicken wire is in place, you should check it regularly to make sure it is secure. If any holes or gaps form, they should be filled in immediately. This will help ensure that your pup does not find a way to dig beneath the chicken wire.</p>

<h2>Tips for Using Chicken Wire to Stop Dogs Digging</h2>

<p>When using chicken wire to keep your pup from digging, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure the chicken wire is buried deep enough that your pup can’t dig beneath it. Second, make sure the chicken wire is securely attached to posts or buried in the ground so it won’t move or be easily removed. Third, make sure the chicken wire is tall enough that your pup won’t be able to jump over it.</p>

<p>Finally, you should also consider adding a layer of mulch or gravel around the perimeter of the chicken wire. This will further discourage your pup from digging and make it easier to spot any holes that may form in the chicken wire.</p>
