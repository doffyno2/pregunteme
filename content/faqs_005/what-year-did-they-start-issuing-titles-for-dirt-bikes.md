<p>Dirt bikes are one of the most popular forms of off-road motorcycling. They are lightweight and offer an exciting experience for riders of all ages. But when did dirt bikes first start getting titles?</p>

<p>In the United States, there have been titles for dirt bikes since the 1970s. The titles were issued by the American Motorcycle Association (AMA). The AMA is the governing body of motorcycle racing in the United States and is responsible for sanctioning events and issuing titles. The titles for dirt bikes were initially issued to professional riders who competed in AMA-sanctioned events.</p>

<p>The titles are known as AMA Pro Racing titles. The AMA Pro Racing titles were issued to riders who achieved a certain level of success in their respective classes. In order to be eligible, riders had to participate in at least three AMA-sanctioned events, and they had to finish in the top three in each event.</p>

<p>The titles were issued to the rider, not the dirt bike itself. This means that the title was not transferable to another bike if the rider changed bikes. The title was also not transferable to another rider if the bike was sold. In other words, the dirt bike and the rider had to remain together in order for the title to remain valid.</p>

<p>As dirt bike racing grew in popularity, the AMA began to issue titles to amateur riders in the late 1980s. These titles were known as AMA Amateur Racing titles. The titles were issued to riders who achieved a certain level of success in their respective classes. In order to be eligible, riders had to participate in at least three AMA-sanctioned events, and they had to finish in the top three in each event.</p>

<p>Today, the AMA continues to issue titles to both professional and amateur riders. The titles are issued to riders who participate in AMA-sanctioned events and achieve a certain level of success. The titles are issued to the rider, not the dirt bike itself. This means that the title is not transferable to another bike if the rider changes bikes and it is not transferable to another rider if the bike is sold.</p>
