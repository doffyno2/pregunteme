<p>It is a heartbreaking moment for any pet owner when their beloved dog stops eating. But how long can a dog survive without food? The answer depends on a variety of factors and whether the dog is receiving any medical treatment.</p>

<p>When a dog stops eating, the body begins to slow down in its metabolic rate and energy production. This is an evolutionary defense mechanism to help the animal survive when food is scarce. As the body slows down, it becomes increasingly unable to fight off disease and infection.</p>

<p>When a dog stops eating, the body also begins to break down its own muscle tissue and fat stores for energy. This can lead to severe weight loss and muscle wasting. As a general rule, dogs can usually survive up to three weeks without food, although this can vary. After three weeks, the body will start to shut down and the dog may become very weak and eventually die.</p>
