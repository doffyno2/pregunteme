When it comes to finding the right size pants for your body type, it can be a daunting task.

One of the most common measurements you’ll find on a pair of pants is the waist size. Knowing what size pants is a 42 inch waist can help you make the right choice when shopping. 

<h2>Waist Measurement</h2>

When it comes to waist size, it’s important to know the difference between the actual waist measurement and the waist size of the pants. The actual waist measurement is the circumference of your waist. This is measured by wrapping a measuring tape around your waist, just above your hipbone. The waist size of the pants is the size of the waistband on the pants, and this is usually a few inches larger than your actual waist measurement. 

<h2>Pants Sizes</h2>

Pants sizes are usually expressed in two numbers, for example, 34/32. The first number is the waist size of the pants, and the second number is the length of the inseam. So, in this example, the waist size is 34 inches, and the inseam is 32 inches. 

<h2>Waist Sizes</h2>

When it comes to waist sizes, there are two different types of pants sizes. The first is regular pants sizes, which are usually expressed as even numbers such as 32, 34, 36, etc. The second type is plus size pants, which are usually expressed as odd numbers such as 33, 35, 37, etc. 

<h2>Size 42 Pants</h2>

If you have a waist measurement of 42 inches, then you would need to buy a pair of pants with a waist size of 42. This would be a size 42 regular pants, or a size 43 plus size pants. The inseam length would depend on your height and preference, but a standard men’s pants inseam is usually 32 inches. 

<h2>Finding the Right Fit</h2>

When it comes to finding the right fit for your body type, it’s important to try on different sizes and styles to find the one that fits you best.
