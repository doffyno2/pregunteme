Learning how to properly balance your dog’s diet is key to keeping them healthy and happy.</p>

<h2>What Is Sugar?</h2>

It’s important to note that these percentages refer to the amount of added sugars in their diet, not the amount of naturally occurring sugars found in fruits and vegetables. </p>
