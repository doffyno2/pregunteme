<p>It's a question many of us have wondered: how many shots of espresso can kill you? Well, the answer depends on many factors, including the strength of the espresso, your body weight, and how much caffeine you are used to consuming. In this article, we'll explore the risks of drinking too much espresso, what symptoms to watch out for, and how to reduce your risk of overdose.</p>

<h2>What Is an Espresso?</h2>

<p>Espresso is a strong, concentrated form of coffee that is made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans. It contains about two to three times more caffeine than regular drip coffee.

<h2>How Much Caffeine Is in Espresso?</h2>

<p>The amount of caffeine in espresso varies depending on the type of beans used and the brewing method. Generally, one shot of espresso contains approximately 64 milligrams of caffeine.

<h2>How Can I Reduce My Risk of Caffeine Overdose?</h2>
