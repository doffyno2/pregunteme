Falling into water can be a frightening experience, but with the right knowledge and preparation, it can be survivable. This article outlines how to survive if you find yourself suddenly immersed in water, whether you are swimming in a pool, drifting in the open ocean, or have been thrown off a boat. It explains the steps you need to take to stay calm and keep yourself afloat, as well as what to do if you are in a current or have lost sight of land. With the right information, you can greatly increase your chances of surviving a fall into water. 

<h2>How to Prepare Yourself Before Falling Into Water</h2>

Before you ever find yourself in a situation where you might fall into water, it is important to take the necessary precautions to ensure your safety. The first step is to wear a life jacket or other flotation device whenever you are on or near water. This will help to keep you afloat if you do end up falling in. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the water conditions, such as tide and currents, and always swim with a buddy who can help in case of an emergency. 

<h2>What to Do If You Fall Into Water</h2>

If you do find yourself suddenly immersed in water, the most important thing to remember is to remain calm and conserve your energy. It is also important to remember to relax and try to float instead of thrashing around and tiring yourself out. To help you stay afloat, you should spread your arms and legs out as wide as possible and kick your feet in a rhythmic motion. Doing this will help you to stay afloat and conserve energy. If you are wearing a life jacket, you should make sure that the straps are tight and that your head is above the water. 

<h2>What to Do If You Are In a Current or Have Lost Sight of Land</h2>

If you are in a current or have lost sight of land, it is important to stay calm and try to identify a point ahead of you where you could potentially make it to safety. If you can, you should try to make your way back to land by swimming parallel to the shore until you reach a safe point. If you are unable to make it back to shore, you should try to find something that can help you stay afloat, such as a piece of debris or a buoy. Once you have something to help you stay afloat, it is important to remain calm, conserve energy, and signal for help.
