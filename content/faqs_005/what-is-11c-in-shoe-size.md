<p>When shopping for shoes, a lot of people get confused about what size to buy. Shoes come in a variety of sizes, from infants to adults, and it can be hard to figure out which size is right for you. One common size system is the “C” size system, which is a numerical system used to indicate size. So, if you’ve ever seen a size labeled 11C, you’re probably wondering what that means. In this article, we’ll explain exactly what 11C in shoe size means, so you can make sure you’re getting the right size when you shop for shoes.</p>

The “C” size system is used to indicate width, and it stands for “child” or “children’s.” In this system, sizes are indicated in numbers, but with a letter at the end. For example, 11C means size 11 with a narrow width.</p>
