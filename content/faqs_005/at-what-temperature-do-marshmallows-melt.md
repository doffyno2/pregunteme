<p>Marshmallows are a beloved treat enjoyed by children and adults all over the world. They are chewy, sweet, and perfect for roasting over a campfire or for adding a bit of sweetness to hot chocolate. But have you ever wondered at what temperature marshmallows melt?</p>

<p>Marshmallows are made up of a special combination of sugar, gelatin, and other ingredients that are heated and then cooled in a specific way. This combination of ingredients and process gives marshmallows their unique texture, flavor, and melting point. So, at what temperature do marshmallows melt?</p>

<h2>The Melting Point Of Marshmallows</h2>

<p>The melting point of marshmallows is 107°F (41.7°C). That's not very hot, but it's still hot enough to start melting them if they are exposed to it for too long. This melting point can vary depending on the type and brand of marshmallow. Some brands may melt at slightly lower or higher temperatures.</p>

<h2>What Causes Marshmallows To Melt?</h2>

<p>Marshmallows are made up of a combination of ingredients that are heated and then cooled in a specific way. This combination of ingredients and process gives marshmallows their unique texture, flavor, and melting point. However, when marshmallows are exposed to temperatures above their melting point, they will start to melt. The heat causes the marshmallow to break down into a softer, gooey texture.</p>

<p>The heat also breaks down the sugar and gelatin in the marshmallow, and this is what causes them to melt. While the melting point of marshmallows is relatively low, they can still be exposed to too much heat and start to melt. This can happen if they are left in a hot car or in direct sunlight for too long.</p>

<h2>Will Marshmallows Re-Solidify When Cooled?</h2>

<p>The good news is that marshmallows will re-solidify once they've been exposed to too much heat. When the marshmallows cool down, the sugar and gelatin will re-solidify and the marshmallows will return to their original shape. However, it's important to note that marshmallows that have been melted will not return to their original texture, so they may not be suitable for roasting over a fire or adding to hot chocolate.</p>

<h2>How To Prevent Marshmallows From Melting</h2>

<p>If you want to keep your marshmallows from melting, it's important to store them in a cool, dark place. This will help keep the marshmallows at their melting point and prevent them from melting. It's also important to keep them away from direct sunlight or any other sources of heat.</p>

<p>You can also try freezing your marshmallows. This will help keep them solid and prevent them from melting. Just make sure to thaw them before eating, as they can become hard if left in the freezer too long.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Marshmallows have a melting point of 107°F (41.7°C), and they can start to melt if exposed to temperatures above this. The heat causes the marshmallow to break down into a softer, gooey texture. Luckily, marshmallows will re-solidify once they've been exposed to too much heat. To prevent marshmallows from melting, store them in a cool, dark place and keep them away from direct sunlight or any other sources of heat.</p>
