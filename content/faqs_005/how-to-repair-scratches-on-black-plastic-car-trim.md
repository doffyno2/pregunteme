<p>Black plastic car trim is a popular choice for many car owners, but it can be prone to scratches. From poor parking to weather-related damage, there are many ways to get scrapes and scratches on your car trim. Fortunately, there are a few ways to repair the damage and prevent further damage in the future.</p>

<h2>Why is Black Plastic Car Trim So Prone To Scratches?</h2>

<p>Black plastic car trim is made of a thin layer of plastic which is prone to damage. The plastic is easily scratched, dented and chipped, no matter how careful you are when parking or driving. In addition, the black plastic is susceptible to the sun’s UV rays which can cause fading and discoloration. Weather-related damage is also a common issue. Rain and snow can cause the plastic to become brittle and more prone to scratches.</p>

<h2>How To Repair Black Plastic Car Trim Scratches</h2>

<p>If you have a few light scratches on your car trim, you can repair them using a few simple tools. You will need some rubbing compound, a microfiber cloth, and a pair of protective gloves.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Clean The Surface</h3>

<p>The first step is to clean the surface of the car trim. Use a damp cloth and some mild soap to remove any dirt or debris. Then allow the trim to dry completely before you begin the repair.</p>


<h3>Step 2: Apply The Rubbing Compound</h3>

<p>Once the trim is dry, use a microfiber cloth to apply the rubbing compound. Rub the product into the scratches gently and in a circular motion. This will help to remove any superficial scratches and restore the plastic.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Wipe Away Excess Product</h3>

<p>Once you’ve finished rubbing in the product, use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe away any excess product. This will help to prevent any further scratches or damage.</p>

<h2>How To Prevent Future Scratches On Black Plastic Car Trim</h2>
