<p>Mirrored furniture is a great way to add a touch of decadence and elegance to any room. However, due to its fragile nature, it can be prone to cracking or chipping, which can be a nightmare if you don’t know how to repair it. Fortunately, repairing cracked mirrored furniture is a lot easier than you might think - with the right tools and techniques, you can restore your furniture to its former glory in no time at all.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need to gather the following materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>A clean, dry cloth</li>
<li>Glass glue</li>
<li>Glass cleaner</li>
<li>Glass polishing compound</li>
<li>A razor blade</li>
<li>A caution tape</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step One: Preparing the Area</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing your cracked mirrored furniture is to prepare the area. Begin by cleaning the area around the crack with a clean, dry cloth, then use the glass cleaner to make sure the surface is completely spotless. Once you’ve cleaned the area, use the caution tape to mark off the area around the crack. This will help to ensure that the glue doesn’t spread and cause more damage.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Applying the Glue</h2>

<p>When you’re ready to begin the repair, you’ll need to apply the glass glue to the crack. Start by using the razor blade to scrape away any loose pieces of glass. Once you’ve done this, apply a generous amount of the glass glue to the crack and spread it out evenly. Make sure the glue covers the entire crack and is completely even. You may need to use multiple layers of glue to ensure that the crack is completely sealed.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Finishing the Repair</h2>

<p>Once you’ve applied the glue, you’ll need to wait for it to dry before you can finish the repair. Once it’s dry, use the glass polishing compound to buff the area and restore the shine to the furniture. Finally, use the glass cleaner to remove any residual glue or polishing compounds.</p>
