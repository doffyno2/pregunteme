<p>Rimworld is a popular simulation game that allows players to build and manage their own colonies. Players need to manage their resources, build structures, and defend against raiders and other threats. One of the key elements of Rimworld is the ability to tame and train animals, including dogs, to help with the various tasks. In this article, we will take a look at how to make dogs haul in Rimworld.</p>

<h2>What is Hauling?</h2>

<p>Hauling is one of the main activities of Rimworld. It involves moving items from one place to another, such as from stockpiles to workshops, or from workshops to the colony’s storage. Hauling can be done manually by a colonist, or it can be done by animals, such as dogs. Animals can be trained to haul, making them a valuable asset to any colony.</p>

<h2>Taming and Training Dogs</h2>

<p>Before you can make dogs haul in Rimworld, you must first tame and train them. Taming can be done in one of two ways: either by capturing a wild dog, or by purchasing a dog from a trader. Once the dog is tamed, it can be trained in various activities, such as hauling. Training can be done manually by a colonist, or it can be done with the help of a Training Pack.</p>

<h2>Equipping Dogs for Hauling</h2>

<p>Once the dog is trained in hauling, it must be equipped for the task. This involves equipping the dog with the proper tools and equipment for hauling. The most common tools for hauling are carts and wagons, which can be purchased from a trader. The dog will also need to be outfitted with a harness, which can be crafted using leather and rope. </p>

<h2>Instructing Dogs to Haul</h2>

<p>Once the dog is equipped for hauling, it must be instructed on where and what to haul. This can be done by selecting the “Haul” command from the animal’s “Interact” menu. A list of items that need to be hauled will appear, and the dog can be instructed to haul these items. The dog can also be instructed to haul specific items from specific locations. </p>

<h2>Monitoring the Dog’s Hauling Progress</h2>

<p>Once the dog is instructed to haul, the progress of the task can be monitored. This can be done by selecting the “Monitor” command from the animal’s “Interact” menu. This will bring up a list of items that the dog is currently hauling, as well as the progress of each item. The progress will be displayed as a percentage, and when it reaches 100%, the item will be delivered to its destination.</p>

<h2>Rewarding the Dog for Hauling</h2>

<p>Once the dog has completed its hauling task, it should be rewarded for its effort. This can be done by selecting the “Reward” command from the animal’s “Interact” menu. This will bring up a list of items that the dog can be rewarded with, such as food, toys, or even clothing. The reward should be appropriate for the task that was completed.</p>

<h2>Maintaining the Dog’s Hauling Equipment</h2>

<p>In order to ensure that the dog is able to haul efficiently, its hauling equipment must be maintained. This can be done by selecting the “Maintain” command from the animal’s “Interact” menu. This will bring up a list of items that need to be maintained, such as the harness, cart, or wagon. The items should be inspected regularly and repaired as necessary.</p>
