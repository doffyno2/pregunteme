<p>Are you stuck in the middle of a cycle and need to drain a GE Dishwasher? It’s not a difficult task, but it can be a bit of a hassle if you’re not sure how to do it. Fortunately, draining a GE Dishwasher mid-cycle is easy and can be done in just a few steps. Here’s what you need to know.</p>

<h2>Steps to Drain a GE Dishwasher Mid-Cycle</h2>

<p>1. Locate the drain hose. It’s usually located under the dishwasher, and is attached to the back wall. Unscrew the hose from the wall and remove it from the dishwasher.</p>

<p>2. Place a large bucket or container underneath the hose. This will collect the water that’s about to be drained.</p>

<p>3. Turn the dishwasher off and unplug it from the wall. This will stop the water from continuing to enter the dishwasher.</p>

<p>4. Take the drain hose and place it in the bucket or container. Make sure the end of the hose is below the surface of the water in the bucket.</p>

<p>5. Turn the dishwasher back on, and wait for the water to start draining. Make sure to keep an eye on the water level in the bucket, as it can overflow if not monitored.</p>

<p>6. When the water has completely drained, turn the dishwasher off and unplug it again. Replace the drain hose on the back wall and turn the dishwasher back on.</p>

<h2>Tips for Draining a GE Dishwasher Mid-Cycle</h2>

<p>• Make sure the drain hose is securely attached to the back wall before you turn the dishwasher on. If it’s not, the water could overflow and cause a mess.</p>

<p>• Be sure to keep an eye on the water level in the bucket or container. If it gets too high, turn the dishwasher off and unplug it again.</p>

<p>• If the water doesn’t seem to be draining, check the drain hose for any blockages. If there are any, remove them and then turn the dishwasher back on.</p>
