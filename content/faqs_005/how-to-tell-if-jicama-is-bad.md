Jicama (pronounced “hee-kah-mah”) is a tuberous root vegetable native to Mexico and Central America. Its crunchy white flesh is similar in texture to a water chestnut, and its flavor has been described as a mixture of an apple and a potato. Jicama is a popular ingredient in salads and Mexican dishes, and is also eaten raw as a snack.

But how can you tell if jicama is bad? Unfortunately, jicama is one of those foods that spoils quickly, and it can be difficult to determine whether it's still good to eat or not. In this article, we'll explain the signs of jicama spoilage so that you can tell if it's bad and avoid food poisoning.

<h2>What Does Bad Jicama Look Like?</h2>

The first sign that jicama has gone bad is a change in its appearance. If it's covered in brown spots, has a slimy texture, or has an unpleasant odor, then it's time to toss it out.

Jicama should be firm and have a crisp texture. If it's soft and mushy, then it's best to discard it. If the jicama has started to sprout, then it's definitely past its prime.

<h2>What Does Bad Jicama Smell Like?</h2>

Another way to tell if jicama has gone bad is to give it a sniff. If it has a sour, ammonia-like odor, then it's best to discard it.

<h2>How to Store Jicama</h2>

Storing jicama properly is essential for keeping it fresh and avoiding spoilage. Ideally, jicama should be stored in the refrigerator, where it will keep for up to two weeks.

It's best to wrap the jicama in a paper towel before putting it in the refrigerator. This will help absorb any excess moisture and prevent it from going bad.

<h2>How to Freeze Jicama</h2>

If you want to keep jicama for a longer period of time, then you can freeze it. To do this, peel and dice the jicama and put it in a freezer-safe container or bag. It will keep for up to six months in the freezer.

When you're ready to use it, simply thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and use it as desired.

<h2>How to Tell If Cooked Jicama is Bad</h2>

Cooked jicama should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If it has been left out at room temperature for more than two hours, then it's best to discard it.

Cooked jicama that has been stored in the refrigerator should be eaten within three to four days. If it has an off odor or an unnatural color, then it's best to discard it.
