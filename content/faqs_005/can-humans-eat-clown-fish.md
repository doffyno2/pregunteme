Clown fish can be cooked in a variety of ways, including baking, grilling, steaming, and frying. The most popular method is to fry the fish in olive oil or butter, as this will help to bring out the flavour of the fish. Before frying, it is important to season the fish with salt and pepper, as well as any other herbs and spices of your choice. It is also important to cook the fish thoroughly, as undercooked fish can contain harmful bacteria which can cause food poisoning.
