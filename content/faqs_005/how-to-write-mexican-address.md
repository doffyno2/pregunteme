<p>Writing an address in Mexico can be tricky, as the format is not the same as in the United States or other countries. It is important to get the address right so that your mail or package is delivered to the right destination. Here we will explain the right way to write a Mexican address.</p>

<h2>Address Format</h2>

<p>The address format in Mexico is very different from other countries in that it typically includes the recipient’s name, the street address and the postal code, all on the same line. The individual components should be separated by commas. The format is as follows:</p>

<p>Name of recipient, Street name and number, Postal code</p>

<p>For example, if you are sending a letter to a person named Juan Perez, at Calle de la Paz 22, Mexico City, the address should be written as follows:</p>

<p>Juan Perez, Calle de la Paz 22, Mexico City 06300</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>Sometimes, the address may include additional information. This can include information such as the apartment or suite number, the floor number, or the office number. When including this information, it should be added after the street address and before the postal code. For example:</p>

<p>Juan Perez, Calle de la Paz 22, 5th Floor, Mexico City 06300</p>

<h2>State Codes</h2>

<p>In Mexico, the state codes are written before the postal code. The state codes are two-letter abbreviations of the state’s name. For example, Mexico City is abbreviated as “DF”, for Distrito Federal. Therefore, the address for Juan Perez in Mexico City should be written as follows:</p>

<p>Juan Perez, Calle de la Paz 22, DF 06300</p>

<h2>What About PO Boxes?</h2>

<p>PO Boxes are not commonly used in Mexico. If you are sending a letter or package to a PO Box, you should include the PO Box number after the recipient’s name and before the city name. For example, the address for Juan Perez in Mexico City should be written as follows:</p>

<p>Juan Perez, PO Box 1234, Mexico City 06300</p>

<h2>What About Rural Areas?</h2>

<p>In rural areas, the address should include the name of the municipality and the state code. For example, if you are sending a letter to a person named Juan Perez in the municipality of Oaxaca, the address should be written as follows:</p>

<p>Juan Perez, Municipio de Oaxaca, OAX 06300</p>
