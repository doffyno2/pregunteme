<p>The I-130 is a petition for an alien relative, which is used to establish the relationship between a U.S. citizen and an alien relative. It is the first step in obtaining a green card for the alien relative. A successful I-130 petition will be approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the alien relative will be granted a green card. If you have filed an I-130 petition and are wondering if it has been approved, there are several ways to find out.</p>
