<p>Most modern cars are equipped with a key fob, which allows you to unlock and start your car without having to manually insert a key into the ignition. While key fobs offer added convenience and security, they can also be a source of frustration if they ever malfunction or get lost. So, if you’re wondering “how far can you drive without a key fob?”, the answer is that it depends on the make and model of your car. In this article, we’ll explore the different factors that can affect how far you can drive without a key fob and provide some tips on how to get back on the road if you ever find yourself in this situation.</p>

<h2>How Does a Key Fob Work?</h2>

<p>A key fob is an electronic security device that is used to control access to a vehicle. It typically acts as a remote control to lock or unlock a vehicle’s doors, trunk, and/or ignition. It may also be used to activate a car alarm or immobilizer. The key fob typically contains a chip and an antenna, which are used to communicate with the vehicle’s on-board computer. It may also be referred to as a “remote keyless system”, “remote locking system”, or “transponder key”.</p>

<h2>How Far Can You Drive Without a Key Fob?</h2>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the make and model of your car. The range of a key fob is typically limited to 30 to 50 feet, but some vehicles may be able to go further. The range of a key fob also depends on whether it is using a radio frequency or an infrared signal. If your car has a keyless ignition system, you may be able to drive a few miles without the key fob, but this varies by make and model. The keyless ignition system uses a sensor to detect the presence of the key fob in the driver’s pocket, so if the key fob is not in the driver’s pocket, the car will not start.</p>
