What is the 208 Area Code?

The 208 area code is an area code located in the U.S. state of Idaho. This area code was created in 1997 when the state of Idaho split from the 919 area code. The 208 area code covers most of the state of Idaho, except for the panhandle region, which is covered by the 406 area code.

The 208 area code is located in the Mountain Time Zone and covers most of the state of Idaho. It serves most of the state's population, as it encompasses all of the cities of Boise, Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Coeur d'Alene, and Lewiston, as well as many other cities and small towns.



An area code is a three-digit identifier that represents a geographic region in the United States and Canada. Area codes are used to help identify the location of a phone call and to route the call to the appropriate telephone company for that area. Area codes are also used to identify a specific geographic area for cellular service.

The United States and Canada have a total of 493 area codes, with each area code covering a specific geographic region. When a person dials a telephone number, the first three digits of the number indicate which area code the phone number is associated with.



The 208 area code was first introduced in 1997 when the state of Idaho split from the 919 area code. Prior to the split, the 919 area code was used to cover the entire state of Idaho. After the split, the 208 area code was created to cover most of the state of Idaho, while the 406 area code was created to cover the panhandle region. 

The 208 area code is located in the Mountain Time Zone and covers most of the state of Idaho, except for the panhandle region, which is covered by the 406 area code. It serves most of the state's population, as it encompasses all of the cities of Boise, Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Coeur d'Alene, and Lewiston, as well as many other cities and small towns.



When dialing a number in the 208 area code, it is important to remember to include the area code with the seven-digit telephone number. This is true for both local and long distance calls, as the area code must be dialed in order for the phone call to be routed to the correct telephone company.

When calling a number within the same area code, it is not necessary to dial the area code. However, when dialing a number outside of the 208 area code, it is important to include the area code with the seven-digit telephone number.
