<p>Dog doors are a great way to give your pup some freedom to come and go as they please, and they allow you to easily keep an eye on your pet when they are outdoors. However, if not installed properly, a dog door can be a source of drafty air and can even blow open in windy conditions. If you’re having trouble keeping your dog door from blowing open, there are several things you can do to solve the problem.</p>

<h2>Secure the Door Flap</h2>

<p>The first step to keeping your dog door from blowing open is to secure the door flap. Most dog doors come with a tensioning system to keep the flap in place; you can adjust the tension with a screwdriver or allen wrench. You should adjust the tension until the flap is tight and secure, but still easy enough for your pup to push open. If you cannot adjust the tension, you may need to replace the flap.</p>

<h2>Install a Lock</h2>

<p>If the tensioning system is not enough to keep your dog door securely closed, you can install a lock on the outside of the door. Many pet stores sell locks specifically designed for dog doors, and they are simple to install. Once the lock is installed, you can keep the door securely closed when necessary. Be sure to choose a lock that is easy to open and close so that your pup can get in and out without difficulty.</p>

<h2>Add Weatherstripping</h2>

<p>Another way to prevent air from entering through the dog door is to add weatherstripping. Weatherstripping is a flexible material that you can install around the edges of the door flap. This will help to create an airtight seal that will keep the cold air out and prevent the door from blowing open in windy conditions. You can buy weatherstripping at your local home improvement store.</p>

<h2>Reinforce the Frame</h2>

<p>If your dog door is still blowing open, you may need to reinforce the frame. You can do this by adding additional screws or nails to the sides of the frame, or by using a piece of wood or metal to secure the frame to the wall. This will help to keep the frame from flexing and will make it more difficult for wind to blow the door open.</p>

<h2>Install a Wind Stopper</h2>

<p>If all else fails, you can install a wind stopper on your dog door. A wind stopper is a small device that attaches to the outside of the door and prevents it from blowing open in windy conditions. Wind stoppers are easy to install and are available in a variety of sizes, so you can find one that fits your dog door perfectly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Dog doors can be a great way to give your pup some freedom, but if not installed correctly, they can be a source of drafty air and can even blow open in windy conditions. If you’re having trouble keeping your dog door from blowing open, there are several things you can do to solve the problem. By securing the door flap, installing a lock, adding weatherstripping, reinforcing the frame, and installing a wind stopper, you can keep your dog door securely closed and prevent it from blowing open.</p>
