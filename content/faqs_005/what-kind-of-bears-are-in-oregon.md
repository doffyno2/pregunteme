Oregon is known for its diverse wildlife, including many species of bears. Oregon is home to two species of bear, the American black bear and the grizzly bear. While the grizzly bear was once found throughout the state, it is now considered to be a threatened species in Oregon.

<h2>American Black Bear</h2>

The American black bear is the most common species of bear found in Oregon. They can be found in a variety of habitats, from the mountains to the coast. Black bears are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. They feed on a wide variety of foods, from berries and nuts to fish, small mammals, and insects.

Black bears are shy animals and usually try to avoid people. They are most active during the night and spend their days in dens or resting in trees. Black bears can be found in the Cascade Mountains, the Coast Range, and the Siskiyou Mountains.

<h2>Grizzly Bear</h2>

The grizzly bear is the largest bear species in Oregon. Once found throughout the state, the grizzly bear is now considered to be a threatened species in Oregon. The grizzly bear is an omnivore, feeding on plant matter such as berries, nuts, and roots, as well as small mammals, fish, and insects.

Grizzly bears are not as common as the black bear in Oregon. They can be found in the Cascade Mountains and the western portion of the Coast Range. Grizzly bears are shy and usually try to avoid people. They are most active during the night and spend their days in dens or resting in trees.

<h2>Bear Safety</h2>

It is important to know how to stay safe around bears. Bears can be dangerous animals, so it's important to take precautions when interacting with them. Here are some tips for staying safe around bears:

<h3>Be Aware of Your Surroundings</h3>

<h3>Carry Bear Spray</h3>
Bear spray is a highly effective deterrent that can be used to keep bears away. It is a good idea to carry bear spray when out in bear country.
