<p>Denamarin is a medication used to protect your dog’s liver from damage and disease. It’s an important medication for any pup that has liver issues, and it’s often prescribed by veterinarians. However, getting your dog to take Denamarin can be a challenge. Here are some tips to help you get your pup to take Denamarin without a fight.</p>

<h2>Choose a Form That Your Dog Likes</h2>

<p>Denamarin comes in two forms: tablets and chewable tablets. Choose whichever form your dog likes best. If your pup doesn’t like either form, you may want to consider asking your vet if there’s an alternative form that your pup may prefer. For example, there are flavored liquid forms of Denamarin that may be more palatable to your pup.</p>

<h2>Hide It in Their Favorite Treats</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to get your dog to take their Denamarin is to hide it in their favorite treats. It’s important to make sure that the treats you use are soft enough to allow the Denamarin to dissolve in them. You can try hiding the Denamarin in mashed potatoes, peanut butter, cream cheese, or yogurt. Your pup will be none the wiser, and they’ll be more likely to take their medication without a fight.</p>

<h2>Try Giving It to Them With Food</h2>

<p>Another way to get your pup to take their Denamarin is to give it to them with their food. This method works best if you’re able to break up the tablet or chewable tablet into small pieces and mix it into their food. If your pup is picky about their food, you may want to try a different method. However, this is usually a good way to get your pup to take their medication without a fight.</p>

<h2>Reward Them After They Take It</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to get your pup to take their Denamarin is to reward them with something they love after they take the medication. This could be a treat, a toy, or even just a few minutes of extra playtime. By rewarding your pup after they take their Denamarin, you’ll be reinforcing the idea that taking their medication is a positive thing that should be rewarded.</p>

<h2>Be Patient and Consistent</h2>
