<p>An 82 is a designation given to a specific type of housing in the United States. The term is used to refer to certain types of homes typically found in suburban areas. These homes are typically single-family dwellings, but may also include duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes. The term 82 is derived from the fact that these dwellings are typically built on 82-foot wide lots.</p>

<p>When an 82 is built, it typically has a basic layout which consists of a master bedroom, two or three additional bedrooms, a kitchen and dining area, a living room, and one or two bathrooms. The lot size for these dwellings usually ranges from about 8,200 square feet to 12,000 square feet. The exterior of an 82 is typically a wood frame, although some may have brick or stucco exteriors. The roof is typically asphalt shingle, although some may have a metal roof.</p>

<p>The interior of an 82 may vary widely depending on the preferences of the homeowner. Common interior features include hardwood or laminate flooring, carpeting, drywall, and a variety of other finishes. Many 82s also have a full basement, which may be partially or fully finished. The basement may be used for living space or for storage.</p>

<p>82s are often found in suburban neighborhoods, where they blend in with other homes of similar size and style. These homes are usually sold on the open market, although some may be part of a homeowners association. Homeowners associations often have rules and regulations regarding the appearance of 82s, as well as restrictions on what type of landscaping and exterior upgrades can be done.</p>

<p>The 82 designation is typically used by real estate agents and brokers to distinguish these types of homes from other types of dwellings. It is also used by mortgage lenders, who may have different lending requirements for 82s than for other types of dwellings.</p>

<h2>Advantages of an 82</h2>

<p>The primary advantage of an 82 is the fact that these dwellings are typically in suburban areas, which often have desirable amenities such as schools, shopping, and recreation. These homes are also typically less expensive than other types of dwellings, which makes them a good choice for first-time homebuyers or for people looking to downsize.</p>

<p>Another advantage of an 82 is the fact that these dwellings typically have a basic layout, which makes them easy to customize. The floor plan can be altered to suit the homeowner's needs, as well as the d√©cor and furnishings. Additionally, the exterior of 82s can be upgraded with landscaping, paint, and other improvements.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of an 82</h2>

<p>One potential disadvantage of an 82 is the fact that these dwellings are typically on smaller lots, which may limit the amount of outdoor space available. Additionally, many 82s may be part of a homeowners association, which can have restrictions on what type of exterior changes can be made. Furthermore, if the 82 is located in an area with high crime or other undesirable characteristics, this may affect the homeowner's ability to sell the property in the future.</p>
