<p>The question of who is the tallest man in the world is a subject of much curiosity and debate. There are various records and claims of who is the tallest man in the world, and these records can change over time. The Guinness World Records keep track of height records, and as of 2020, the tallest man in the world is Sultan Kösen from Turkey, who stands at a remarkable 8 feet 3 inches tall. </p>

<p>Kösen was born in 1982 in Mardin, Turkey, and was diagnosed with pituitary gigantism at the age of 10.

Kösen has also become a symbol of national pride in Turkey, and he has been featured on the country's currency.</p>

<p>Kösen's remarkable height is due to a tumor on his pituitary gland that caused his body to produce an excess amount of growth hormone. As a result, Kösen has experienced numerous health issues, including vision problems and joint pain. He has also had to endure a difficult life due to his size, as he has been unable to find clothes and shoes that fit his feet.</p>
