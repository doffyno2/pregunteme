Fortunately, this article will help you navigate this process so that you can understand exactly how many months you are. 

<h2>What Is the Difference Between Weeks and Months When Pregnant?</h2>

Pregnancy is typically divided into three trimesters, each lasting 12 weeks. The first trimester is typically the most difficult, as this is when the baby is growing and developing the most. The second trimester is typically considered the “golden period” of pregnancy, as this is when the baby continues to grow and develop, but the mother is typically feeling less sick. The third trimester is when the baby finishes growing and prepares for birth. 

<h2>What Are Some Things to Know About the Third Trimester?</h2>

The third trimester is typically considered the “home stretch” of pregnancy. During this time, the baby is continuing to grow and develop, and the mother is usually feeling more tired and uncomfortable. This is also the time when the mother should start to prepare for the birth. It is important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have, and to make sure that you are getting the right nutrition and exercise to support a healthy pregnancy.
