Victorious was a popular Nickelodeon comedy series that ran from 2010 to 2013 and featured Victoria Justice, Ariana Grande, Avan Jogia, and Liz Gillies, among other stars. It was a show that followed the lives of a group of teenagers who attended a prestigious performing arts high school in Los Angeles. Despite its success, the show was cancelled after its fourth season and fans have been wondering why it was cancelled ever since.

<h2>The Ratings</h2>

Victorious was a popular show, but the ratings were not as high as the network had hoped. The show's first season was the highest rated at an average of 2.6 million viewers. This dropped after the second season, with ratings falling to an average of 2.3 million viewers. The third season saw an even steeper decline, with ratings averaging 1.8 million viewers. By the fourth season, viewership had dropped to an average of 1.4 million viewers. This was a significant drop from the first season and the network decided to cancel the show.

<h2>The Cost of Production</h2>

Victorious was one of the most expensive shows to produce for Nickelodeon. The show was filmed at a large studio in Los Angeles and featured elaborate sets and costumes. The show also featured numerous guest stars, which added to the production costs. The high cost of production, coupled with the declining ratings, made it difficult for the network to justify keeping the show on the air.

Ariana Grande was also beginning to pursue a singing career, while Avan Jogia was becoming increasingly busy with movie roles. Liz Gillies was also pursuing a music career and had a starring role in the Nickelodeon series, “Lizze McGuire”. As the cast's careers began to take off, it was difficult for them to commit to the show, which made it difficult for the producers to plan for the future.

<h2>The End of an Era</h2>

Victorious was the end of an era for Nickelodeon. It was the last show from the network's golden age of live-action shows. After Victorious was cancelled, Nickelodeon shifted its focus to cartoons and reality TV shows. This marked a major change for the network and signaled the end of an era for Nickelodeon fans.
