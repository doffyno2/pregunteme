Orienteering compasses are essential tools for navigating in the great outdoors. Whether you’re hiking, camping, or taking part in a competitive orienteering event, having a good quality compass can make a huge difference in your safety and success. 

But what makes a good orienteering compass? There are many different features and specifications to consider, so it can be difficult to know what to look for when shopping for a compass. In this article, we’ll outline the essential features of a good orienteering compass and explain how to use it correctly.

<h2>What Is Orienteering?</h2>

Orienteering is a sport that combines running, navigation, and outdoor exploration. It involves navigating from one point to another using a map and a compass. Competitors are given a topographic map and are tasked with reaching a series of control points in the shortest possible time. 

Orienteering requires a great deal of skill and knowledge, as well as a good quality compass. Competitors must be able to read a topographic map, use a compass to orient themselves, and accurately estimate distances. 

<h2>What Is an Orienteering Compass?</h2>

An orienteering compass is a specialized device designed to help you navigate accurately in the outdoors. It consists of a base plate, a rotating housing with degree markings, and a magnetic needle. The base plate is used to measure distances, while the rotating housing and magnetic needle help you orient yourself with the map.

A good quality orienteering compass should have several features, including a sighting line for accurate navigation, a clinometer for measuring slopes, and a magnifying lens for reading maps. It should also be lightweight and durable, so that it can withstand the rigors of outdoor use.

<h2>How to Use an Orienteering Compass</h2>

Using an orienteering compass correctly requires practice and skill. Here are the basics steps for getting started:

<h3>Step 1: Set the Declination</h3>

The first step is to adjust your compass for declination. Declination is the difference between true north and magnetic north, which varies depending on your location. To adjust your compass for declination, simply rotate the housing until the red needle is aligned with the correct degree. 

<h3>Step 2: Orient the Map</h3>

Next, you’ll need to orient your map. To do this, hold the compass in your hand and align the straight edge of the base plate with the north-south lines on your map. Then, rotate the map and compass together until the red needle is aligned with the “N” on your compass housing. This will ensure that your map is oriented correctly. 

<h3>Step 3: Take a Bearing</h3>

Once your map is oriented, you can take a bearing. To do this, rotate the compass housing until the red needle is aligned with the north-south lines on the map. Then, look at the degree markings on the housing to determine the bearing. This will tell you the direction you need to go to reach your destination.

<h3>Step 4: Follow the Bearing</h3>

Finally, you’ll need to follow the bearing. To do this, hold the compass in your hand and point the direction of travel arrow towards your destination. Then, walk in the direction of the arrow until you reach your destination. 

<h2>Benefits of Orienteering Compasses</h2>

Orienteering compasses offer many benefits for outdoor enthusiasts. Here are some of the key advantages:

<h3>Accuracy</h3>

Orienteering compasses are highly accurate tools for navigating in the outdoors. They allow you to accurately measure distances, take bearings, and orient yourself with the map. This ensures that you always know where you are and where you’re going.

<h3>Durability</h3>

Orienteering compasses are designed to withstand the rigors of outdoor use. They are lightweight and built to last, so you can trust them to perform in any conditions. 

<h3>Versatility</h3>

Orienteering compasses are versatile tools that can be used for a variety of outdoor activities. From hiking and camping to orienteering competitions, they can help you get where you need to go safely and quickly. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Orienteering compasses are essential tools for navigating in the great outdoors. They offer accuracy, durability, and versatility, making them essential for any outdoor enthusiast. When shopping for an orienteering compass, look for one that has a sighting line, clinometer, and magnifying lens. And remember to practice using your compass and map together before heading out into the wilderness.
