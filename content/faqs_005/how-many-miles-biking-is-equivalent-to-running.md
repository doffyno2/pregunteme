How Many Miles Biking is Equivalent to Running?



Running and biking are two of the most popular forms of physical exercise. Both aerobic activities are great for cardiovascular health, muscle toning, and fat burning. But if you’re trying to decide between running and biking, you may be wondering how many miles biking is equivalent to running.

<h2>Calories Burned While Running and Biking</h2>

When it comes to physical exercise, calories burned are a primary factor in determining how effective the workout is. Running and biking are both excellent calorie-burning activities, although the exact number of calories burned depends on the intensity and duration of the activity.

On average, running burns about 10 calories per minute, while biking burns about 7.5 calories per minute. So if you’re looking for a more intense workout, running may be the way to go. However, if you’re looking for a more leisurely activity, biking may be the better option.

<h2>Distance-Based Comparison of Running and Biking</h2>

If you’re trying to decide between running and biking as your primary form of exercise, one way to compare the two is by looking at distance. Generally speaking, biking is a more efficient form of exercise than running.

On average, a person can bike about three times farther in the same amount of time it takes to run the same distance. So if you’re looking to get the most out of your exercise time, biking may be the way to go.

<h2>Heart Rate While Running and Biking</h2>

When it comes to physical exercise, your heart rate is a key indicator of how intense your workout is. The higher your heart rate, the more intense the exercise.

When it comes to running and biking, running typically has a higher heart rate than biking. Running increases your heart rate more quickly and it takes longer for your heart rate to return to normal after running. Biking, on the other hand, has a lower heart rate than running, but it takes longer for your heart rate to return to normal after biking.

<h2>Muscle Activation While Running and Biking</h2>

Another key factor in determining how effective your workout is is muscle activation. Running engages more of your muscles than biking does, so if you’re looking for a more intense workout, running may be the way to go.

On the other hand, if you’re looking for a more leisurely activity, biking may be the better option. Biking engages fewer of your muscles than running does, so it’s a good option for people who are just starting out with physical exercise or for those who have physical limitations.

<h2>How Many Miles Biking is Equivalent to Running?</h2>

So how many miles biking is equivalent to running? The exact answer depends on the intensity and duration of your workout, as well as your individual fitness level. 

Generally speaking, a person can bike about three times farther in the same amount of time it takes to run the same distance. So if you’re looking to get the most out of your exercise time, biking may be the way to go.
