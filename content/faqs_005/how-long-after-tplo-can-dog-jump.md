TPLO, or Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy, is a commonly performed orthopedic procedure in dogs that helps to alleviate the pain caused by a torn cranial cruciate ligament (CCL). Dogs that have had this procedure can often make a full recovery, but the healing process can take several months and requires a great deal of patience and care from their owners. One of the most common questions that pet owners have about the recovery process is, “How long after TPLO can a dog jump?”

<h2>What is a TPLO Procedure?</h2>

TPLO stands for Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy, and it is a surgical procedure designed to correct the instability in the knee joint caused by a torn CCL. The CCL is a ligament that helps to stabilize the knee joint, and it can tear due to excessive strain or trauma. When a CCL tear is not treated, it can cause pain, instability, and lameness in the affected leg.

During a TPLO procedure, the surgeon will make a cut in the tibia bone and then rotate the top portion of the bone to a different angle. This changes the angle at which the joint functions, which can help to reduce the strain on the CCL and allow the joint to move more freely.

<h2>What to Expect After TPLO Surgery</h2>

After a TPLO procedure, your dog will need to be confined in a small area for at least six weeks. During this time, your dog should not be allowed to jump or engage in any strenuous activity. This is to ensure that the knee joint has a chance to heal properly and that your dog does not put any additional strain on the joint.

Your veterinarian will likely recommend a rehabilitation program for your dog to help them regain strength and mobility. This will involve exercises that your dog can do while they are confined, such as leash walks, swimming, and range-of-motion exercises.

<h2>When Can a Dog Jump After TPLO Surgery?</h2>

The amount of time it takes for a dog to be able to jump after a TPLO procedure can vary. Some dogs may be able to start jumping as early as two months after surgery, while others may need more time to heal. It is important to consult with your veterinarian to determine when your dog is ready to return to their normal activities.

In general, it is best to wait for your veterinarian’s approval before allowing your dog to jump or engage in any strenuous activities. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your dog’s recovery process and advise you when it is safe for your dog to return to their normal activities.

<h2>Tips for Jumping After TPLO Surgery</h2>
