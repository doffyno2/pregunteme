How Many Grams of Carbs in a Tablespoon of Sugar?

Sugar is one of the most popular sweeteners used in cooking and baking, and it is also a major source of carbohydrates. Many people are curious to know how many grams of carbs are in a tablespoon of sugar. The answer depends on the type of sugar used, as well as the size of the tablespoon. In this article, we will discuss the different types of sugar and how many grams of carbohydrates they contain per tablespoon.



Sugar is a type of carbohydrate that provides energy to the body. There are several different types of sugar, including granulated sugar, brown sugar, and powdered sugar.

<h2>Granulated Sugar</h2>

Granulated sugar is the most commonly used type of sugar. It is made from either cane or beet sugar and is available in both white and brown varieties. Granulated sugar is a refined product, meaning that it has been processed to remove the molasses and other impurities. One tablespoon of granulated sugar contains approximately 12.6 grams of carbohydrates.

<h2>Brown Sugar</h2>

Brown sugar is made from either cane or beet sugar and is slightly darker in color than granulated sugar. Brown sugar is also more moist and has a slightly more caramel-like flavor. One tablespoon of brown sugar contains approximately 13.2 grams of carbohydrates.

<h2>Powdered Sugar</h2>

Powdered sugar is a fine, white powder made from granulated sugar. It is often used in baking and for making frostings, glazes, and other confectionery items. One tablespoon of powdered sugar contains approximately 11.3 grams of carbohydrates.



When measuring sugar, it is important to use a measuring spoon or cup that is designed for measuring dry goods. A standard tablespoon should hold about 3 teaspoons of sugar, and a standard cup should hold about 16 tablespoons of sugar. It is also important to use the correct type of sugar for the recipe. For example, if the recipe calls for granulated sugar, do not use brown sugar or powdered sugar.
