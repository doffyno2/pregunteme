<p>If you own a Toyota Corolla 2017 and need to reset the maintenance light, you’ve come to the right place. Resetting the maintenance light is a relatively simple process that can be done from the comfort of your own home. The maintenance light on your Corolla is set to turn on after a certain number of miles, indicating that it is time for a routine service or checkup. By resetting the maintenance light, you can continue to keep track of how many miles you’ve driven and when it’s time to bring your car in for a checkup.</p>

<h2>What Is the Maintenance Light?</h2>

<p>The maintenance light is a feature that is built into your Corolla. It is designed to alert you when it’s time to bring your car in for a checkup or service. The maintenance light will usually turn on after a certain number of miles, usually around 10,000 miles. When the light turns on, it’s time to head to your local mechanic or dealer for a checkup.</p>

<h2>How to Reset Maintenance Light on Toyota Corolla 2017</h2>

<p>Resetting the maintenance light on your Corolla is a relatively simple process. All you need is your key, a flat head screwdriver, and a few minutes of your time. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start by inserting your key into the ignition and turning it clockwise to the “on” position.</li>
  <li>Using the flat head screwdriver, press and hold down the odometer/trip reset button located on the dashboard.</li>
  <li>While pressing down on the odometer/trip reset button, turn the key counterclockwise to the “off” position.</li>
  <li>Release the odometer/trip reset button and turn the key back to the “on” position.</li>
  <li>The maintenance light should now be reset and the odometer should now read “0”.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it! You’ve successfully reset the maintenance light on your Toyota Corolla 2017. Remember, though, that the maintenance light will come on again after a certain number of miles, so make sure to keep track of when it’s time to bring your car in for a checkup.</p>

<h2>Other Common Maintenance Light Issues</h2>

<p>In some cases, the maintenance light may not be resetting properly. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as a faulty battery or a problem with the car’s computer system. If this is the case, you’ll need to bring your car in to a qualified mechanic or dealer and have them diagnose the issue and reset the light for you.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that resetting the maintenance light does not mean that you can skip routine maintenance. While resetting the light will allow you to keep track of how many miles you’ve driven, it does not replace regular checkups and servicing. Make sure to take your car in for a checkup at least once a year or every 10,000 miles, whichever comes first.</p>
