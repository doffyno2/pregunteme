<p>Fishing is a popular pastime in the state of Wisconsin, and for those who want to take advantage of its plentiful resources, getting a valid fishing license is a must. Every angler in Wisconsin must obtain a valid license before they begin fishing, and understanding the expiration dates of the license is important. In this article, we will explore when fishing licenses expire in Wisconsin, and what anglers need to do to maintain their validity.</p>

<h2>What is the Standard Fishing License Expiration Date in Wisconsin?</h2>

<p>The standard fishing license expiration date in Wisconsin is March 31 of each year. This means that all fishing licenses purchased after April 1 of the previous year will be valid until March 31 of the current year. For example, if a fishing license is purchased on January 1, 2021, it will be valid until March 31, 2021.</p>

<h2>Do Fishing Licenses Expire on Different Dates in Wisconsin?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are some exceptions to the standard fishing license expiration date of March 31. For example, there are some licenses that are only valid for a certain amount of days. These licenses, called limited-term licenses, are valid for a set number of days from the date of purchase. For example, if an angler purchases a three-day license on January 1, 2021, it will be valid until January 3, 2021.</p>

<h2>What if I Don't Use All of My Fishing License?</h2>

<p>If you don't use all of your fishing license, you can still get a refund for the unused portion. However, you must apply for the refund before the license expires. If you wait until after the license expiration date, you will not be eligible for a refund.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Exceptions to the Expiration Date?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are some exceptions to the expiration date. For example, some licenses are valid for different lengths of time depending on the type of license. For example, a two-year resident fishing license is valid for two years from the date of purchase, rather than the standard expiration date of March 31. Additionally, some licenses may be extended for up to one year if the angler meets certain criteria.</p>

<h2>What if My Fishing License Expires While I'm Out Fishing?</h2>

<p>If your fishing license expires while you're out fishing, you are still required to have a valid license. If you don't, you could face fines or other penalties. For this reason, it's important to make sure your license is valid before you go out fishing.</p>

<h2>Can I Renew My Fishing License Early?</h2>

<p>Yes, you can renew your fishing license early if you wish. However, you will only be able to renew it for the same length of time as the original license. For example, if you have a one-year resident fishing license, you can renew it for another one-year period.</p>

<h2>Do I Need to Renew My Fishing License Every Year?</h2>
