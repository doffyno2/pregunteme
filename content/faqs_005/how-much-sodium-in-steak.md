<p>When it comes to steak, it's usually thought of as a delicious, nutritious and healthy dish. But what many people don't realize is that steak can also be high in sodium. The amount of sodium in steak depends on the cut of meat and how it is prepared. In this article, we will explore how much sodium is in steak and how to reduce the amount of sodium in your steak dish.</p>

<h2>What is Sodium?</h2>

<p>Sodium is an essential mineral that helps regulate the body’s fluid balance, nerve and muscle function, and blood pressure. It is found naturally in many foods, and it can also be added to foods to enhance flavor. Too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health issues.</p>

<h2>How Much Sodium Is in Steak?</h2>

<p>The amount of sodium in steak varies depending on the type of steak and how it is prepared. A 3-ounce serving of cooked, trimmed steak contains about 70 milligrams of sodium. However, processed and cured steak, such as corned beef and pastrami, can have up to 500 milligrams of sodium per 3-ounce serving. In addition, steak dishes prepared with a lot of added salt or sodium-containing ingredients, such as sauces or marinades, can contain even more sodium.</p>

<h2>How to Reduce the Sodium in Steak</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to reduce the amount of sodium in your steak dish, there are several steps you can take. First, choose leaner cuts of steak that are lower in fat and sodium, such as flank steak or filet mignon. Additionally, trim off any visible fat before cooking and avoid cured and processed meats. When marinating or seasoning your steak, use herbs, spices, and fresh lemon juice instead of high-sodium ingredients like soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Finally, opt for low-sodium condiments, such as mustard or salsa, when serving your steak.</p>
