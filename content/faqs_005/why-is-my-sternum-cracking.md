<p>Most of us have heard the sound of our sternum cracking or popping, but we don’t know why it is happening. This is a common experience that can be quite alarming, as it might cause discomfort and pain, as well as worry. Here, we discuss the potential causes of sternum cracking and what you can do if you experience it.</p>

<h2>What is the Sternum?</h2>

<p>The sternum, or breastbone, is a flat bone that lies in the middle of the chest and connects the ribs together. It’s connected to the spine and is an important part of the body’s structural support system. It’s also known as the body’s “central axis” and helps protect vital organs like the heart, lungs, and other internal organs.</p>

<h2>What Causes Sternum Cracking?</h2>

<p>Sternum cracking can be caused by a variety of factors, including:</p>

<h3>1. Trauma or Injury</h3>

<p>Sternum cracking can occur after a trauma or injury, such as a fall, a car accident, or a sports-related injury. The cracking sound is usually caused by a disruption in the structure of the sternum, which can be caused by a direct blow to the chest.</p>

<h3>2. Overuse or Repetitive Stress</h3>

<p>Overuse or repetitive stress can also cause sternum cracking. When the sternum is overstretched or overused, it can cause the cartilage to become weak and crack. This can be due to activities such as heavy lifting, carrying heavy objects, or doing repetitive motions such as running.</p>

<h3>3. Muscle Tension or Strain</h3>

<p>Muscle tension or strain can also cause the sternum to crack. This is usually due to a tightness in the chest muscles, which can be caused by stress, poor posture, or other activities that involve the chest area.</p>

<h3>4. Osteoarthritis</h3>

<p>Osteoarthritis is a form of arthritis that affects the joints. It can cause the joints to become stiff and swollen, which can cause cracking or popping sounds as the joints move. Osteoarthritis can affect the sternum, and can cause sternum cracking.</p>

<h3>5. Cartilage Deterioration</h3>

<p>Cartilage deterioration can also cause sternum cracking. As we age, our cartilage can naturally deteriorate, making it more prone to cracking and popping. This can be due to aging, or a lack of movement in the chest area.</p>

<h2>When to See a Doctor?</h2>

<p>Although sternum cracking is usually not serious, it’s important to seek medical attention if you experience any pain or discomfort. Sternum cracking can be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a fracture or a heart condition, and it’s important to get it checked out to rule out any potential problems.</p>

<h2>Treating Sternum Cracking</h2>

<p>Treatment for sternum cracking depends on the cause. If the cause is trauma or injury, the best treatment is to rest and avoid any strenuous activity until the area has healed. If the cause is overuse, it’s important to rest and avoid activities that involve the chest area. If the cause is muscle tension or strain, stretching and strengthening exercises can help relieve the tension. Osteoarthritis can be managed with medications and lifestyle changes. Finally, cartilage deterioration can be managed with physical therapy, medications, and lifestyle changes.</p>
