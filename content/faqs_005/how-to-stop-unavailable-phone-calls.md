How to Stop Unavailable Phone Calls


Unavailable phone calls are a nuisance that almost everybody experiences at some point. Whether you’re trying to answer a business call or returning a friend’s call, these calls can take up your time, energy and resources. Unavailable phone calls are not only annoying, they can be dangerous. In some cases they can be used to scam you out of money or personal information. That’s why it’s important to know how to stop unavailable phone calls as soon as possible.



Unavailable phone calls are calls that cannot be answered. They may be from private or blocked numbers, telemarketers, or automated call systems. When you receive an unavailable phone call, the caller ID will display a message saying “unavailable” or “private number”. These calls can be from various sources, including spammers, scammers, and telemarketers.



It’s important to be able to identify unavailable phone calls so that you can take the necessary steps to stop them. Here are some tips to help you identify these calls:

<h2> Call Display </h2>

When you receive an unavailable phone call, the caller ID will usually display a message saying “unavailable” or “private number”. If the caller ID does not say this, but you still think the call may be from a blocked or private number, you can try to dial *67 before the number to see if the caller ID changes. If the caller ID changes to “unavailable” or “private number”, then you know the call is from a blocked or private number.

<h2> Unfamiliar Numbers </h2>

If you receive a call from an unfamiliar number, it may be an unavailable call. Unavailable calls are often from numbers that are not in your phonebook, so if you don’t recognize the number, it may be an unavailable call. 

<h2> Unusual Ringtone or Voicemail Message </h2>

When you receive an unavailable call, it may have a different ringtone than other calls or it may go straight to voicemail. If you receive an unfamiliar ringtone or your voicemail message changes when you receive an unavailable call, it may be an indication that the call is from a blocked or private number. 



Once you have identified an unavailable phone call, there are some steps you can take to stop them. Here are some tips for how to stop unavailable phone calls:

<h2> Block the Number </h2>

If you’re receiving calls from a blocked or private number, you can block the number on your phone. Most phones allow you to block numbers, so you can block the number to stop receiving calls from it.

<h2> Use Call Blocking Apps </h2>

There are a variety of call blocking apps available for both iOS and Android devices. These apps allow you to easily block unwanted calls and texts. Some even allow you to block numbers from a specific area code or region.

<h2> Contact Your Phone Carrier </h2>

If you’re receiving a lot of unavailable calls, you may want to contact your phone carrier. Your phone carrier may be able to provide a service that blocks unwanted calls and texts. 

<h2> Report the Number </h2>

If you receive a call from a blocked or private number that you think may be a scammer or telemarketer, you should report the number to the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC may be able to take action against the caller if enough people report the number.
