<p>Stouffer’s Lasagna Party Size is a delicious and convenient option for large gatherings or special occasions. The aluminum lid that comes with the lasagna must be tented in order to ensure that the lasagna remains hot and fresh. Tented aluminum lids are also used to prevent food spoilage and to maintain an even temperature inside the container.</p>

<p>The following steps will help you tent an aluminum lid for the best results:</p>

<h2>Step 1: Preheat Oven</h2>

<p>Preheat the oven to 375°F before starting. This will ensure that the lasagna is cooked to perfection.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Place Aluminum Foil Over the Pan</h2>

<p>Take a piece of aluminum foil and cover the top of the pan. Make sure that it covers the entire top of the pan, including the edges. This will help to prevent heat from escaping.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Place Aluminum Lid on Top of Foil</h2>

<p>Place the aluminum lid on top of the foil. Make sure that it is centered and that it covers the entire top of the pan.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Create Tents</h2>

<p>Fold the edges of the aluminum foil over the edges of the aluminum lid. Create several tents to ensure that heat does not escape from the sides. This will also help to prevent the lasagna from drying out.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Bake Lasagna According to Directions</h2>

<p>Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake according to the directions on the box. Do not open the oven during the baking process as this can cause a loss of heat.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Let Lasagna Cool Before Serving</h2>

<p>Once the lasagna is done baking, let it cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. This will allow the lasagna to set and will help the flavors to develop.</p>
