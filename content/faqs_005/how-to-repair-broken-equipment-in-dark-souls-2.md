How to Repair Broken Equipment in Dark Souls 2


Dark Souls 2 is a popular action-adventure game, released by FromSoftware in 2014. The game features a unique and challenging combat system that rewards players who are able to master the mechanics of the game. Players must also manage their equipment, as equipment can break if it's used too often or if it's used in a way that it wasn't intended. This can be especially problematic for players who rely heavily on their equipment in order to succeed in the game. In this article, we'll look at how to repair broken equipment in Dark Souls 2.

<h2>What Causes Equipment to Break in Dark Souls 2?</h2>

In Dark Souls 2, equipment can break if it's used too often or if it's used in a way that it wasn't intended. This is usually caused by the player using the same piece of equipment for a long period of time, or by using the equipment in a manner that it wasn't designed for. For example, using a sword as a blunt instrument instead of a cutting weapon will cause it to break more quickly than if it were used for its intended purpose. Additionally, using a shield too often will cause it to break down faster than if it were used sparingly.

<h2>What Can Be Done to Repair Broken Equipment?</h2>

Fortunately, there are several ways to repair broken equipment in Dark Souls 2. The first and most obvious way is to purchase a new piece of equipment. This can be done at any shop in the game, and is often the most convenient way to get your equipment back up and running. However, it's important to note that new equipment can be expensive, so it may not be the best option for all players.

Another option is to hire a blacksmith. Blacksmiths can be found in various locations throughout the game and can repair all types of equipment, including weapons and armor. This is usually the most cost-effective way to repair broken equipment, as the cost of a blacksmith's services is usually much lower than buying a new piece of equipment.

Finally, players can also repair their own equipment using materials found throughout the game. Materials such as twinkling titanite and titanite shards can be used to repair broken equipment, and are usually easy to find. Some equipment can also be repaired using weaponsmith's boxes, which can be obtained from certain enemies or from merchants.

<h2>Tips for Avoiding Broken Equipment</h2>

Repairing broken equipment can be costly, so it's important to take steps to avoid it in the first place. One of the most important steps is to make sure that you're using the right type of equipment for the task at hand. For example, if you're using a sword as a blunt instrument instead of a cutting weapon, you should switch to a hammer or club instead. Additionally, it's important to make sure that you're not overusing your equipment. Even if you're using the right type of equipment, overusing it can cause it to break down faster than if it were used sparingly.
