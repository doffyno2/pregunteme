<p>Fishing sharks in Old School RuneScape (OSRS) can be a very profitable activity. With the right setup and a bit of luck, players can easily make hundreds of thousands of gold pieces per hour. But how much GP/HR can one realistically expect to make when fishing sharks in OSRS?</p>

<h2>What Equipment is Needed to Fish Sharks?</h2>

<p>The most important thing when fishing sharks in OSRS is having the right equipment. Players need a harpoon, an inflatable boat, and a bucket of bait. A harpoon can be bought from the Grand Exchange or made with the Smithing skill. The inflatable boat can be purchased from the Grand Exchange for a few thousand coins, or made using the Crafting skill. Finally, the bait can be bought from the Fishing Guild for 200 coins each. With all the necessary equipment, players are ready to start fishing sharks.</p>

<h2>How to Fish Sharks in OSRS?</h2>

<p>Once players have their harpoon, inflatable boat, and bait, they can head to the Fishing Guild or the Ocean. The Fishing Guild is the best spot for fishing sharks, as it has an infinite supply of the creatures. It is also the safest spot, as there are no aggressive monsters in the area. However, players can also fish sharks in the Ocean, but they will need to watch out for aggressive monsters. Once at the Fishing Guild or the Ocean, players simply need to equip their harpoon, use it on the water, and wait for a shark to bite. When a shark bites, players should immediately reel it in and then repeat the process.</p>

<h2>How Much GP/HR Can Players Make Fishing Sharks?</h2>

<p>The amount of GP/HR players can make fishing sharks depends on several factors. The Fishing level of the player, the number of sharks caught, and the current Grand Exchange prices all play a role in determining the amount of GP/HR players can make. Generally speaking, however, it is not uncommon for players to make upwards of 400K GP/HR when fishing sharks. Of course, this amount can vary greatly depending on the player's Fishing level, the number of sharks caught, and the Grand Exchange prices.</p>

<h2>Tips for Fishing Sharks More Efficiently</h2>
