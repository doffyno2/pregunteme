<p>Fat, or adipose tissue, is a type of connective tissue found in the human body. It is made up of cells called adipocytes, which store energy in the form of triglycerides. This energy is then used to fuel the body's activities, such as digestion and physical activity. But what does fat look like outside the body?</p>

<h2>What Is Fat?</h2>

<p>Fat is made up of triglycerides, which are molecules composed of fatty acids, glycerol, and other compounds. Triglycerides are found in food, but are also produced by the body. In the body, fat is stored in adipose tissue, which is located between organs and beneath the skin. Fat is used to store energy and helps insulate the body.</p>

<h2>What Does Fat Look Like Outside the Body?</h2>

<p>When looking at fat outside the body, it usually appears as a solid, yellowish-white substance. It has a soft, greasy texture, and is often sold by the pound. It is a common ingredient in many foods, as well as in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. It is also used in the production of candles, soaps, and other products.</p>

<h2>What Are the Different Types of Fat?</h2>

<p>There are three main types of fat found outside the body: saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated. Saturated fat is solid at room temperature, and is found in animal products such as butter, cheese, and lard. Monounsaturated fat is liquid at room temperature and is found in olive oil, canola oil, and avocados. Polyunsaturated fat is also liquid at room temperature, and is found in vegetable oils, such as corn and soybean oil.</p>

<h2>What Is the Difference Between Fat and Oil?</h2>

<p>Although they are both composed of triglycerides, fat and oil are not the same. Fat is solid at room temperature, whereas oil is liquid. Fat is also more calorie-dense, meaning it has more calories per gram than oil does. Fat is also more flavor-dense, meaning it has more flavor than oil does.</p>

<h2>What Is the Healthiest Type of Fat?</h2>

<p>The healthiest type of fat is unsaturated fat, which is found in plant-based foods such as nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils. Unsaturated fat is beneficial because it helps reduce cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. It is also a good source of essential fatty acids, which are essential for the body to function properly.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Risks Associated with Eating Too Much Fat?</h2>

<p>Eating too much fat can lead to weight gain and obesity, which can increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other health conditions. In general, it is recommended that adults get no more than 25-35% of their daily calories from fat. It is also important to choose healthy sources of fat, such as unsaturated fats found in plant-based foods.</p>
