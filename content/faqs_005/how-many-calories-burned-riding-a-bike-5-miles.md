Riding a bike is not only a great way to get around, it's also a fantastic way to stay fit and healthy. But just how many calories are burned when you ride your bike five miles? 

<h2>The Basics of Calories</h2>

Calories are a unit of energy, and they are used to measure the amount of energy that our bodies need. When we eat food, the calories that we consume are used to supply our bodies with energy. If we consume more calories than we need, our bodies store the extra energy as fat. On the other hand, if we use more energy than we consume, our bodies burn the stored fat for energy.

The number of calories that you burn when you cycle five miles depends on several factors, including your weight, intensity, and terrain. Generally speaking, a person who weighs 150 pounds will burn around 400 calories when they ride their bike five miles at a moderate speed. However, if the terrain is hilly and the intensity is high, the calorie burn can increase to 500 calories or more.
