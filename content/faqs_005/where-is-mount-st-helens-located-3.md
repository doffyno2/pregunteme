<h2>History of Mount St. Helens</h2>

<p>Mount St. Helens has been active for thousands of years. The volcano has been the source of several major eruptions, including the one in 1980 that devastated much of the surrounding area.

In the aftermath of the eruption, an ash cloud rose more than 15 miles into the sky.</p>

<p>The 1980 eruption was the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic eruption in U.S. history. Fifty-seven people were killed, and hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed. The eruption had a profound impact on the local economy, as many businesses were forced to close down. The volcano also released a large amount of toxic gases and ash into the atmosphere.</p>
