<h2>What Is An Affair?</h2>

<p>An affair is a romantic or sexual relationship between two people who are not married to each other.

Affairs can be short-term or long-term, depending on the circumstances and the individuals involved.</p>

<h2>Factors That Influence How Often Affairs Start Up Again</h2>

<p>There are a number of factors that can influence how often affairs start up again.

<p>One of the most important factors that can influence how often affairs start up again is the personal feelings and emotions of the people involved.
