<p>If you own a 2017 Toyota Sienna and the maintenance light has come on, it can be quite a frustrating experience. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to reset the maintenance light on the 2017 Sienna. In this article, we’ll explain how to reset the maintenance light on your 2017 Sienna and offer a few tips to help you keep your vehicle in good working order.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Maintenance Light</h2>

<p>The maintenance light on your 2017 Sienna is there to remind you when it’s time to get your vehicle serviced. It is important to understand that the maintenance light does not signify a problem with the vehicle, but rather an indication that it is time to have your vehicle serviced. It is important to follow the maintenance schedule outlined in your owner’s manual to ensure that your vehicle is in good working order and that any potential problems are addressed before they become more serious.</p>

<h2>How to Reset the Maintenance Light</h2>

<p>The first step to resetting the maintenance light on your 2017 Sienna is to make sure you have all the necessary tools. You will need a flathead screwdriver, a small screwdriver, and an OBD2 scanner. Once you have gathered all the necessary tools, you can begin the reset process.</p>

<p>The first step is to locate the diagnostic port on your 2017 Sienna. This port is located near the driver’s side, below the steering wheel. Once you have located the port, you can attach the OBD2 scanner to the port. Then, you will need to turn the ignition key to the “on” position, but not to start the engine.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to use the OBD2 scanner to access the vehicle’s on-board diagnostics system. Once you have accessed the system, you will need to select the “maintenance light reset” option. After selecting this option, the maintenance light should turn off and the reset process is complete.</p>
