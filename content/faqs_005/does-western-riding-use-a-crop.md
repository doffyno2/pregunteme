One of the most commonly used tools in Western riding is a crop, so the question is: does western riding use a crop?</p>

<h2>What is a Crop?</h2>

<p>A crop is a tool used by equestrians, typically to cue the horse during riding. It is a long, thin, flexible whip, usually with a looped handle at one end and a blunt tip at the other. The crop is used to tap the horse’s body in order to communicate a cue or command. It is a tool used to provide subtle cues to the horse, as opposed to a riding whip, which is used to provide more severe cues.</p>

<h2>Does Western Riding Use a Crop?</h2>
