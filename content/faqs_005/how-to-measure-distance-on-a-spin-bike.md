Whether you are a beginner or an experienced rider, there are a few tips and tricks on how to measure distance on a spin bike.</p>

<h2>Using the Bike Computer</h2>

<p>Most spin bikes come equipped with a computer that can help you measure distance. The bike computer will display the amount of time that you have spent riding, the total distance you have traveled, and your average speed. Most spin bikes have a reset button, which allows you to start measuring your distance from the beginning of each ride. To use the bike computer to measure distance, simply start your ride, and the computer will measure your progress.</p>
