<p>One Piece is one of the most popular and longest-running anime series ever created. It has been running for over 20 years and consists of over 900 episodes. With so many episodes, One Piece is an overwhelming series to get into, and even more daunting to finish. So how long does it take to watch One Piece?</p>

<p>The answer depends on how much time you have to dedicate to the show. Watching all 900+ episodes of One Piece would take an average of over 200 hours of viewing time, which is equivalent to about 8 days of non-stop watching. This does not include extra time for recaps or rewatching episodes. If you watch 10 episodes a day and take one day off per week, it will take you over 8 months to watch the entire series. </p>

<p>The amount of time it takes to watch One Piece can also depend on the type of viewer you are. If you’re the type of person who likes to watch every episode in order, from start to finish, it will take you a lot longer than someone who skips the filler episodes or focuses on the arcs they are interested in. Some viewers prefer to binge-watch the series, which makes it slightly faster, but not by much. </p>

<h2>How to Watch One Piece Fast</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to watch One Piece in the shortest amount of time possible, there are several methods and strategies that can help you. The first is to skip all the filler episodes, which make up a significant portion of the series. Fillers are episodes that don’t advance the plot and can often be skipped without any major consequences. Skipping the fillers can cut down on the total viewing time significantly.</p>

<p>Another way to watch One Piece quickly is to focus on the arcs that interest you the most. For example, if you’re not a fan of the Fishman Island arc, you can skip it and move on to the next one. This will save you a lot of time, as some arcs can be quite long and drawn out. </p>

<p>Finally, if you’re really pressed for time, you can opt for a binge-watch approach. Binge-watching One Piece can be done by devoting a few days to watching nothing but the show. This method will allow you to get through the entire series in a relatively short amount of time. However, it is not recommended for those who are new to the series.</p>
