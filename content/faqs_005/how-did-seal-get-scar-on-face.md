Seal is one of the most recognizable musicians in the world, and his scar on the left side of his face is one of the most visible features of his look. But how did Seal get his scar on his face? 

The answer is a bit complicated. Seal has had the scar since he was a child, and it is the result of a combination of factors. His early life in London was filled with poverty and violence. Seal's father was an abusive alcoholic, and he physically abused Seal and his siblings. Seal has said that his father used to beat him with a belt buckle, which left him with deep scars. 

In addition to this abuse, Seal had a severe case of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), a chronic autoimmune condition that causes skin lesions and scarring. The condition is caused by an overactive immune response and affects about one in every thousand people. Seal's DLE caused a scarring on the left side of his face that eventually became a permanent feature. 

Seal's scar is a physical reminder of the struggles he faced in his early life. He has also said that it serves as a reminder of the importance of being kind to others and not allowing yourself to become a victim of violence. 

<h2>What is Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)?</h2>

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic autoimmune condition that affects the skin. It is caused by an overactive immune response, which leads to the formation of skin lesions and scarring. These scaly, raised lesions usually appear on the scalp, face, and ears, but can also appear on other parts of the body. The lesions can be itchy and painful, and in some cases, they can lead to hair loss. DLE can also cause scarring on the face, which can be permanent. 

<h2>What are the Symptoms of DLE?</h2>

The primary symptom of DLE is the formation of red, scaly lesions on the skin. These lesions can occur anywhere on the body but are most common on the scalp, face, and ears. The lesions may be itchy or painful, and can become infected if not treated properly. In some cases, the lesions can lead to hair loss. 

<h2>How is DLE Diagnosed?</h2>

DLE is usually diagnosed by a dermatologist based on the appearance of the lesions. A dermatologist may also take a biopsy of the affected area to confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, additional tests may be needed to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. 

<h2>How is DLE Treated?</h2>

The primary treatment for DLE is the use of topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and itching. In some cases, oral medications may be used to suppress the immune response and reduce the risk of scarring. Other treatments may include phototherapy, which involves exposing the skin to ultraviolet light to reduce inflammation, and immunosuppressants, which can help to reduce the activity of the immune system. 

<h2>Can DLE be Prevented?</h2>

Unfortunately, DLE cannot be prevented. However, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition. These include avoiding exposure to ultraviolet light, using sunscreen when outdoors, and avoiding medications that can trigger an overactive immune response.
