<p>When it comes to clothing sizes, everyone wants to know what is the size of their child or what size to buy for someone else. It can be difficult to know what size to get for an adult or a child. This is especially true when it comes to women's sizes. Women's sizes are often different from men's sizes, making it difficult to understand what size to buy. Fortunately, there are some guidelines that can help you figure out what size to buy for a woman.</p>

<p>When it comes to women's sizes, there are two main types: adult sizes and youth sizes. Adult sizes are the ones used for women over 18 years old, while youth sizes are for those under 18. For example, a size 65 in adult sizes would be a size 5 in youth sizes. This is because youth sizes are usually smaller than adult sizes, so a size 65 in adult sizes would be a size 5 in youth sizes.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the sizes may vary depending on the brand. Some brands may use different sizing charts, so it is important to check the size chart for each brand before purchasing. In addition, some brands may use a different size measurement than others. For example, a size 65 in adult sizes may be a size 6 in one brand and a size 5 in another.</p>

<p>When shopping for clothing, it is also important to consider the measurements of the person who will be wearing the clothing. This includes the chest, waist, hips, and inseam measurements.
