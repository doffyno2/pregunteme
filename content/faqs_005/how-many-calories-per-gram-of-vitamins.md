<p>Vitamins are essential for a healthy life, and it is important to understand how many calories per gram of vitamins you need to consume as part of your diet. Vitamins are found in many different foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products, and meat. While there are some vitamins that are fat-soluble and can be stored in the body, most vitamins must be consumed on a regular basis in order to maintain optimal health.</p>

<h2>What Are Vitamins?</h2>

<p>Vitamins are organic compounds that are essential for the body to function properly. They are essential for many of the body’s processes, including growth, development, and maintaining optimal health. Vitamins can be divided into two types: fat-soluble and water-soluble.

<h2>How Many Calories Per Gram of Vitamins Do You Need?</h2>

<p>The amount of calories per gram of vitamins depends on the type of vitamin and how much of it is needed. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body’s fatty tissues, so they don’t need to be consumed in large amounts.

  <li>Vitamin D: 5-15 mcg</li>
  <li>Vitamin E: 15 mg</li>
  <li>Vitamin K: 120-150 mcg</li>
</ul>

<p>For the B-complex vitamins, the RDA is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thiamin (B1): 1.2-1.5 mg</li>
  <li>Riboflavin (B2): 1.3-1.7 mg</li>
  <li>Niacin (B3): 16-20 mg</li>
  <li>Pantothenic acid (B5): 5-7 mg</li>
  <li>Pyridoxine (B6): 1.3-1.7 mg</li>
  <li>Biotin (B7): 30-100 mcg</li>
  <li>Folate (B9): 400-600 mcg</li>
  <li>Cobalamin (B12): 2.4-3 mcg</li>
