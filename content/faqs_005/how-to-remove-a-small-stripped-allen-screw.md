<p>Removing a small stripped allen screw can be a frustrating task. The small size of the screw and the fact that it has become stripped make it even more difficult. Fortunately, with the right tools and techniques, it is possible to remove a small stripped allen screw without damaging the screw or the surrounding material. In this article, we will show you how to remove a small stripped allen screw in just a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>What Is a Small Stripped Allen Screw?</h2>

<p>An Allen screw is a type of screw with a hexagonal head. The hexagonal shape of the head allows it to be driven with an Allen key or wrench, making it easier to tighten or loosen than screws with other head shapes. When an Allen screw is stripped, it means that the head has been damaged or worn away, making it difficult or impossible to turn with an Allen key or wrench. This can happen if the screw is over-tightened or if it is made of a softer material than the Allen key or wrench.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Required</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Allen key or wrench</li>
  <li>Screw extractor</li>
  <li>Drill</li>
  <li>Drill bits</li>
  <li>Vice grips</li>
  <li>Hammer</li>
  <li>Thread locking compound</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Determine the Size of the Screw</h2>

<p>The first step in removing a small stripped allen screw is to determine the size of the screw. This will determine which tools and techniques will be needed to remove the screw. If you don't know the size of the screw, you can measure it with a ruler, or you can try to fit an Allen key or wrench of the same size into the head of the screw.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Apply Thread Locking Compound</h2>

<p>Once you have determined the size of the screw, the next step is to apply some thread locking compound to the screws. This will help to lubricate the screw, making it easier to remove. It will also help to fill in any gaps between the head of the screw and the Allen key or wrench, making it easier to turn.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Use an Extractor</h2>

<p>If the screw is still stuck, the next step is to try using a screw extractor. A screw extractor is a tool designed to grip the head of the screw and then turn it counter-clockwise to remove it. If the head of the screw is too damaged to grip, you can try using a drill bit to create a new head that can be gripped by the extractor.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Use Vice Grips</h2>

<p>If the extractor does not work, the next step is to try using a pair of vice grips. Vice grips are designed to grip the head of the screw, and then turn it counter-clockwise to remove it. Be careful when using vice grips, as they can easily damage the head of the screw.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Use a Hammer and Punch</h2>

<p>If the vice grips do not work, the next step is to try using a hammer and punch. Place the punch on the head of the screw, and then strike it with the hammer. This will force the screw out of the material it is stuck in. Be careful when using this technique, as it can easily damage the surrounding material.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Replace the Screw</h2>

<p>Once the screw has been removed, you should replace it with a new one. Make sure to use the same size and type of screw as the one removed. Also, make sure to apply some thread locking compound to the new screw before installing it.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Q: What is a small stripped allen screw?</h3>
<p>A: A small stripped allen screw is a type of screw with a hexagonal head. The hexagonal shape of the head allows it to be driven with an Allen key or wrench, making it easier to tighten or loosen than screws with other head shapes. When an Allen screw is stripped, it means that the head has been damaged or worn away, making it difficult or impossible to turn with an Allen key or wrench.</p>

<h3>Q: What tools and materials are required to remove a small stripped allen screw?</h3>
<p>A: To remove a small stripped allen screw, you will need an Allen key or wrench, a screw extractor, a drill, drill bits, vice grips, a hammer, and some thread locking compound.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I determine the size of a small stripped allen screw?</h3>
<p>A: You can determine the size of a small stripped allen screw by measuring it with a ruler, or by trying to fit an Allen key or wrench of the same size into the head of the screw.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I apply thread locking compound to a small stripped allen screw?</h3>
<p>A: To apply thread locking compound to a small stripped allen screw, simply apply a small amount of the compound to the head of the screw. This will help to lubricate the screw and make it easier to remove.</p>

<h3>Q: What should I do if the screw extractor does not work?</h3>
<p>A: If the screw extractor does not work, you can try using a pair of vice grips to grip the head of the screw and turn it counter-clockwise to remove it. If that does not work, you can try using a hammer and punch to force the screw out of the material it is stuck in.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I replace a small stripped allen screw?</h3>
<p>A: To replace a small stripped allen screw, you should use the same size and type of screw as the one removed. Make sure to apply some thread locking compound to the new screw before installing it.</p>

<h3>Q: What should I do if I can't find a replacement screw?</h3>
<p>A: If you cannot find a replacement screw, you can try using a helicoil kit. This kit contains a series of threaded inserts that can be used to repair damaged threads. However, this should only be done as a last resort, as it is more time consuming and difficult than simply replacing the screw.</p>
