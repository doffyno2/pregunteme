<p>Blobfish are a unique species of deep sea fish that have gained a significant amount of attention due to their unusual appearance. They have large heads, bulbous eyes, and an overall gelatinous body shape that sets them apart from other fish. But are blobfish considered fish? The answer is yes, blobfish are fish. </p>

<p>Blobfish are members of the Psychrolutidae family, which is a group of deep sea fish that live in the cold deep waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. They are typically found at depths of 800-1200 meters, but can be found as deep as 3000 meters. The fish are slow-moving and generally quite docile, but they can use their large heads to defend themselves if necessary. </p>

<p>Blobfish are distinguished by their large heads, bulbous eyes, and a gelatinous body shape. They have no scales and their skin is thick and slimy, which helps them to maintain buoyancy while they are in the deep sea. Despite their unusual appearance, blobfish are still technically fish and are classified as such. </p>

<h2>What Do Blobfish Eat?</h2>

<p>Blobfish have adapted to their deep sea habitat and have evolved to feed on whatever is available in the cold waters. They have a varied diet that consists of small crustaceans, mollusks, and worms. They also feed on small fish and other slow-moving animals that live in the deep sea. Blobfish have evolved to become very efficient foragers and can find food in the depths much better than other fish. </p>

<h2>Are Blobfish Endangered?</h2>

<p>Blobfish are not considered to be endangered or threatened at this time. However, they are vulnerable to overfishing and habitat destruction due to their slow-moving nature and deep sea habitat.
