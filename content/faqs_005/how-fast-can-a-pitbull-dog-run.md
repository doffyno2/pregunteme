<h2>Factors That Influence a Pitbull's Speed</h2>

<p>There are a number of factors that can affect how fast a pitbull can run. These include the dog's size, age, breed, and the environment it is running in. Additionally, the dog's physical health, diet, and exercise routine will also affect its speed.</p>

<h2>The Size of the Dog</h2>

<p>The size of the dog is one of the most important factors in determining how fast it can run.
