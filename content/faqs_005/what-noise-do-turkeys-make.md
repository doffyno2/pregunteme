When you think of a turkey, what comes to mind? Is it the iconic holiday bird, the one that appears on the table each Thanksgiving? Or is it the wild North American birds that are found throughout the continent? Regardless of what image of a turkey pops into your head, itâ€™s likely that one of the first things you think of when you think of turkey is their unmistakable gobble. But what noise do turkeys actually make? 

<h2>The Sounds of Wild Turkeys </h2>

When most people think of the sound of turkeys, they think of the iconic gobble. But wild turkeys actually make a variety of sounds. The sounds wild turkeys make depend on the species, age, and sex of the bird. 

<h3>Gobbling </h3>

Gobbling is the most recognizable sound made by wild turkeys. While some might think that gobbling is only made by male turkeys, both male and female turkeys can make this sound. Male turkeys, however, are more likely to make this sound than female turkeys. Gobbling is mainly used during mating season. Male turkeys will make this sound to attract mates and to advertise their presence to other males. 

<h3>Purring </h3>

Purring is another sound made by wild turkeys. This sound is usually made by both male and female turkeys and is used to indicate contentment and satisfaction. When a turkey purrs, it will often keep its head low and its wings spread slightly.
