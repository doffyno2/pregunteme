<p>If you’ve ever set up a practice putting mat in your living room, you know how difficult it can be to get it just right. You have to make sure that the mat is perfectly flat, the putting surface is smooth, and the ball rolls true. If any of these things aren’t right, your practice sessions will be a waste of time.</p>

<p>But don’t worry – flattening a practice putting mat is actually pretty easy once you know how. In this article, we’ll show you how to flatten a practice putting mat in just a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>Things You’ll Need</h2>

<p>Before you get started, you’ll need to make sure you have the following items:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A practice putting mat</li>
    <li>A large, flat, hard surface</li>
    <li>A rolling pin or other heavy object</li>
    <li>A damp cloth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Set Up the Mat</h2>

<p>First, you’ll need to set up the mat on a large, flat, hard surface. If you don’t have a large enough surface, you can lay the mat on the floor, but make sure that the surface is still flat and hard. A carpeted floor will not work for this process.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Roll Out the Mat</h2>

<p>Once the mat is set up on a flat surface, you can begin rolling out the mat. Start at one end of the mat and slowly roll out the mat in a straight line. Make sure that the mat is spread out evenly and that there aren’t any wrinkles or bumps.</p>

<p>Once the mat is spread out evenly, use a rolling pin or other heavy object to press down on the mat. This will help ensure that the mat is completely flat and that the ball will roll true.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Dampen the Mat</h2>

<p>Once the mat is completely flattened, you can begin dampening the mat. Use a damp cloth and carefully dab the cloth on the mat. This will help to remove any wrinkles or bumps on the mat and will also help to remove any debris from the mat.</p>

<p>Once the mat is dampened, use a dry cloth to remove any excess moisture from the mat. Make sure that the mat is completely dry before you move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Roll Out the Mat Again</h2>

<p>Once the mat is dry, you’ll need to roll out the mat again. Start at one end of the mat and slowly roll out the mat in a straight line. Make sure that the mat is spread out evenly and that there aren’t any wrinkles or bumps.</p>

<p>Once the mat is spread out evenly, use a rolling pin or other heavy object to press down on the mat. This will help ensure that the mat is completely flat and that the ball will roll true.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Let the Mat Dry</h2>

<p>Once the mat is completely flattened, you should let the mat dry completely before using it. This will help to ensure that the mat is completely flat and that it will stay that way.</p>
