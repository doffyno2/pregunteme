<p>The question of whether or not illegal immigrants can travel by plane domestically is a complex one. It depends on a variety of factors, including the country of origin, the destination, and the particular circumstances of the traveler. In general, however, it is not possible for an illegal immigrant to travel domestically by plane.</p>

<p>In the United States, for example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for the enforcement of immigration laws. The DHS requires that all travelers have proper documentation in order to board a domestic flight. This means that an illegal immigrant would not be able to board a domestic flight without the proper documentation. Additionally, even if an illegal immigrant managed to board a domestic flight, they would still be subject to removal by immigration authorities upon arrival.</p>

<p>In other countries, the laws regarding travel by illegal immigrants may be different. For example, in Canada, an illegal immigrant may be able to board a domestic flight if they can produce valid identification and a Canadian passport. However, they may still be subject to removal by immigration authorities upon arrival.</p>

<p>In general, it is not advisable for an illegal immigrant to attempt to travel domestically by plane. The risks of being caught and removed by immigration authorities are too great, and there is no guarantee that the traveler will be able to board the plane in the first place. Additionally, in some countries, the penalties for attempting to travel domestically without proper documentation can be severe.</p>
