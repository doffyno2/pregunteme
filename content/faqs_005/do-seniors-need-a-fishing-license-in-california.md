<p>Fishing is a popular recreational activity in California, and while many people assume that they can just get out on the water and start fishing, the truth is that anyone over the age of 16 must have a valid fishing license to legally fish in the Golden State. That includes seniors, who may be surprised to find out that they are subject to the same regulations as everyone else.</p>

<h2>What Is A Fishing License?</h2>

<p>A fishing license is a document issued by the state of California that authorises an individual to legally fish in the state’s waters. A valid fishing license must be carried at all times when fishing and must be presented to any wildlife officer upon request.</p>

<h2>Who Needs A Fishing License?</h2>

<p>In California, anyone 16 years of age or older must have a valid fishing license to legally fish in the state. This includes seniors, who must purchase a fishing license just like any other angler. The only exceptions are for residents who are part of the following groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Active duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces.</li>
  <li>Youth under the age of 16.</li>
  <li>Seniors over the age of 70.</li>
</ul>

<p>These groups are exempt from having to purchase a fishing license, but they must still follow all other regulations and limits when fishing.</p>

<h2>What Are The Different Types Of Fishing Licenses?</h2>
