<h2>What is Potato Starch?</h2>

<h2>Are There Any Risks of Feeding Potato Starch to Dogs?</h2>

While potato starch is generally safe for dogs, it is important to be aware of the potential risks. Eating too much potato starch can cause digestive upset, and it can also lead to weight gain if it is not given in moderation. Additionally, potato starch is high in carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike in some dogs.
