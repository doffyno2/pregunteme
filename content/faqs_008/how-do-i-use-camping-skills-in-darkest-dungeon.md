<p>Darkest Dungeon is a role-playing video game that involves managing a group of heroes as they explore a vast and dangerous dungeon. The game is known for its challenging battles, interesting characters, and unique mechanics. One of the more interesting mechanics is the use of camping skills, which can make all the difference when exploring the game’s dungeons. This article will explain what camping skills are, how they work, and the best ways to use them in Darkest Dungeon.</p>

<h2>What are Camping Skills?</h2>

<p>Camping skills are special abilities that heroes can use while exploring a dungeon. They cost no Stress and can be used multiple times throughout a dungeon run. Camping skills are divided into two categories: Minor and Major. Minor camping skills are passive abilities that can provide small bonuses or give heroes extra actions. Major camping skills are active abilities that provide more powerful effects. All heroes have access to two Minor camping skills and one Major camping skill.</p>

<h2>How do Camping Skills Work?</h2>

<p>When using camping skills, it’s important to remember that they have a limited number of uses. Minor camping skills can be used up to three times per dungeon run, while Major camping skills can only be used once. It’s also important to note that camping skills can’t be used in the same turn as a hero’s normal action. In addition, some camping skills may have additional cooldowns, meaning they can’t be used more than once in a certain amount of time.</p>

<h2>The Best Camping Skills for Darkest Dungeon</h2>

<p>When choosing which camping skills to use in Darkest Dungeon, it’s important to consider the specific needs of the hero and the situation. Some camping skills are better suited for certain roles or scenarios, while others are more general-purpose. Here are some of the best camping skills for Darkest Dungeon:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Inspiring Tune</b> – Inspiring Tune is a Minor camping skill that grants all nearby heroes an extra action. This is incredibly useful for quickly dispatching enemies or setting up a devastating combination of attacks.</li>
  <li><b>Corporeal Fortitude</b> – Corporeal Fortitude is a Major camping skill that grants the hero and all nearby allies a significant boost to their Defense. This can be invaluable in tough battles where the party needs to survive a barrage of enemy attacks.</li>
  <li><b>Mental Fortitude</b> – Mental Fortitude is a Minor camping skill that grants the hero and all nearby allies a significant boost to their Stress resistance. This can help the party weather the toughest of dungeons, as Stress can often be more dangerous than the enemies themselves.</li>
  <li><b>Preparation</b> – Preparation is a Minor camping skill that grants the hero a bonus to all of their attributes. This can be invaluable when the hero needs to be in top form for a tough battle.</li>
  <li><b>Rejuvenation</b> – Rejuvenation is a Major camping skill that grants the hero and all nearby allies a significant boost to their Health. This can be invaluable when the party is low on health and needs a quick boost.</li>
</ul>
