Mesh shoes are a popular choice for many athletes. They are comfortable, lightweight, and breathable. However, they are not indestructible and may require some repair from time to time. If your mesh shoes have developed a hole, you can easily fix them with some basic supplies and a bit of patience. This article will cover the steps necessary to fix a hole in mesh shoes.

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

Before you start repairing your mesh shoes, you will need to gather the necessary supplies. You will need a pair of scissors, a needle and thread, and an adhesive such as glue or a fabric patch. 

<h2>Cutting Out the Hole</h2>

The first step in repairing your mesh shoes is to cut out the hole. Using a pair of scissors, carefully cut away the damaged fabric. Make sure to cut as close to the edges of the hole as possible without cutting away any of the mesh that is still intact. 

<h2>Sewing the Patch</h2>

Once you have cut out the hole, you can begin sewing the patch in place. Thread the needle with a sturdy thread and begin sewing the patch to the mesh. Start from the center of the patch and work your way outward, making sure to sew along the edges of the patch. It is important to keep the stitches small and tight, otherwise the patch may come off. 

<h2>Applying the Adhesive</h2>

Once the patch is in place, you can apply an adhesive to secure it in place. This can be done with either a fabric adhesive or a waterproof glue. Make sure to apply the adhesive evenly and to cover the entire patch. Allow the adhesive to dry completely before wearing the shoes. 

<h2>Finishing Up</h2>

Once the adhesive has dried, you can finish up the repair process by trimming away any excess fabric or thread. Make sure to take your time and to be careful not to cut away too much of the mesh.
