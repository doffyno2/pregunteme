<p>Gaps between the window sill and wall can be a nuisance for homeowners. Not only do these gaps look unsightly, but they can also let in drafts and cause other energy efficiency issues. Fortunately, there are several ways to fill the gap between your window sill and wall, depending on the size of the gap. In this article, we’ll look at how to fill the gap between your window sill and wall and the materials you’ll need to do the job.</p>

<h2>What Materials You’ll Need to Fill the Gap</h2>

<p>The materials you’ll need to fill the gap between your window sill and wall will depend on the size of the gap. Small gaps can be filled with caulk, while larger ones will require other materials such as expanding foam or mortar.</p>

<h3>Caulk</h3>

<p>Caulk is a versatile material that can be used to fill small gaps between the window sill and wall. It is inexpensive and easy to use. To use caulk, simply run a thin bead of caulk along the gap and use a wet finger to smooth it out. Caulk is available in various colors and can be painted to match the color of your walls.</p>

<h3>Expanding Foam</h3>

<p>Expanding foam is a great option for filling larger gaps. It is also easy to use and comes in a can with an applicator nozzle. All you need to do is point the nozzle at the gap and squeeze the trigger to fill the gap. The foam will expand and fill the gap completely. Once it has dried, you can use a knife or sandpaper to trim off any excess.</p>

<h3>Mortar</h3>

<p>Mortar is a good option for filling larger gaps between the window sill and wall. It is a bit more difficult to use than caulk or expanding foam, but it is very durable and will last a long time. To use mortar, you will need to mix it with water to form a paste and then apply it to the gap. Use a trowel to spread the mortar and make sure it is evenly distributed. Allow the mortar to dry before painting.</p>

<h2>Steps to Fill the Gap</h2>

<p>Now that you know the materials you’ll need to fill the gap between your window sill and wall, let’s look at the steps to do it. Follow these steps to fill the gap between your window sill and wall.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Clean the Gap</h3>

<p>The first step is to clean the gap. Use a vacuum or a brush to remove any dirt or debris from the gap. Make sure the surface is clean and dry before proceeding.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Material</h3>

<p>Once the gap is clean, you need to decide what material to use. If the gap is small, caulk is the best option. For larger gaps, expanding foam or mortar are better choices. Choose the material that best suits your needs.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Fill the Gap</h3>

<p>Once you have chosen the material, you can fill the gap. Follow the instructions on the product packaging to ensure a successful application. Be sure to read and follow all safety instructions when using any of these materials.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Allow to Dry</h3>

<p>Once you have filled the gap, you need to allow the material to dry completely before proceeding. Depending on the material you are using, this could take several hours or even days. Be sure to read the instructions on the product packaging to determine the drying time.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Paint if Desired</h3>

<p>Once the material has dried, you can paint it if desired. Caulk is available in various colors, so you may not need to paint it. However, if you are using expanding foam or mortar, you may need to paint it to match the color of your walls. Use a paint brush or roller to apply the paint.</p>
