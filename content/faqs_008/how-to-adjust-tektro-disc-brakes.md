<p>Tektro disc brakes are one of the most popular types of brakes on the market. They provide great stopping power and control, and are relatively easy to adjust. If you've got a set of Tektro disc brakes, here's a step-by-step guide to adjusting them for the best performance.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check the Brake Pads</h2>

<p>The first step in adjusting your Tektro disc brakes is to check the brake pads. You should look for any signs of wear or damage. If the pads are worn or damaged, they should be replaced before you attempt to adjust the brakes. Check the alignment of the pads as well. They should be parallel to each other and centered on the rotor. If they're not, you'll need to adjust them.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the Brake Caliper</h2>

<p>After checking the brake pads, you should adjust the brake caliper. This is done by loosening the bolts that hold the caliper in place and then sliding it up or down the rotor until it's in the desired position. Make sure the caliper is centered before tightening the bolts back up.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Pad Contact Point</h2>

<p>The next step is to adjust the pad contact point. This is done by loosening the bolts that hold the brake pads in place and then sliding them up or down the rotor until they make contact with the rotor. Once they make contact, tighten the bolts back up. This will ensure that the pads are making full contact with the rotor when the brakes are applied.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Adjust the Lever Reach</h2>

<p>The last step in adjusting your Tektro disc brakes is to adjust the lever reach. This is done by loosening the screws that hold the lever in place and then sliding it up or down the handlebar until it's in the desired position. Once it's in the desired position, tighten the screws back up.</p>
