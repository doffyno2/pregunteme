<h2>Why Does the Time Differ Between Japan and Other Countries?</h2>

<p>The time difference between Japan and other countries is due to the different time zones that are used in each country. Each country has its own time zone, which is based on its location. For example, Japan is in the Eastern Hemisphere, so its time zone is 9 hours ahead of the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). On the other hand, countries in the Western Hemisphere such as the United States and Canada have their own time zones which are behind UTC by several hours.</p>

<p>The time difference between countries also depends on Daylight Saving Time (DST). DST is a system where countries shift their clocks forward during summer months and back during winter months. This can cause a time difference between countries even if they are in the same hemisphere. For example, Japan does not observe Daylight Saving Time, whereas the United States does. This means that during summer months, the United States is 1 hour ahead of Japan, while during winter months, the United States is 2 hours behind Japan.</p>
