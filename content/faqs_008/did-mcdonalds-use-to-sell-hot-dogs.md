<p>From its humble beginnings in 1940, McDonald's has grown from a small restaurant in California to one of the most recognizable brands in the world. For decades, the fast-food giant has been known for its burgers, fries and shakes, but one lesser-known fact is that McDonald's used to sell hot dogs. Yes, you read that correctly: McDonald's used to sell hot dogs. </p>

<p>In the late 1970s, McDonald's began testing hot dogs in some of its restaurants. The company offered hot dogs at a select number of locations in California, Ohio and Michigan. The hot dogs were sold in a variety of sizes, from small to large, and were served with either ketchup or mustard. While the hot dogs were popular with customers, the company decided to discontinue them in 1983. </p>

<h2>Why Did McDonald's Stop Selling Hot Dogs?</h2>

<p>There are a few reasons why McDonald's decided to stop selling hot dogs. The first reason is that the company wanted to focus on its core menu items, such as burgers and fries. Since hot dogs were not a core item, they were seen as an unnecessary distraction. </p>

<p>The second reason is that McDonald's wanted to simplify its menu. Hot dogs require more preparation time than burgers and fries, which meant that they were taking up valuable space in the kitchen and slowing down service. By removing hot dogs from the menu, McDonald's was able to streamline its operations and improve customer service. </p>

<h2>What Other Restaurants Sell Hot Dogs?</h2>

<p>While McDonald's no longer sells hot dogs, there are a number of other restaurants that do. Sonic Drive-In is one of the most popular fast-food restaurants that offers hot dogs. Sonic's hot dogs come in a variety of sizes and flavors, such as chili cheese and jalapeno cheddar. </p>

<p>Other fast-food chains that offer hot dogs include 7-Eleven, Arby's, Burger King, Dairy Queen, Hardee's, Jack in the Box, KFC, and Wendy's. Hot dogs can also be found at traditional restaurants and hot dog stands, such as Nathan's Famous and Dog Haus. </p>

<h2>What Are the Healthiest Hot Dogs?</h2>

<p>When it comes to choosing the healthiest hot dog, there are a few factors to consider. First, look at the ingredients list. Hot dogs can be made with a variety of meats, such as beef, pork, chicken and turkey. Choose a hot dog that is made with leaner meats, such as chicken or turkey. </p>

<p>Second, look for hot dogs that are free of artificial preservatives, colors and flavors. Many hot dogs contain nitrates, which are added to preserve the meat and give it its pink color. Nitrates have been linked to increased risk of cancer, so it's best to avoid them if possible. </p>

<p>Finally, look for hot dogs that are lower in sodium and fat. Many hot dogs are high in sodium, which can contribute to high blood pressure and increase risk of heart disease. Look for hot dogs that are labeled as "reduced sodium" or "low sodium." The same goes for fat: look for hot dogs that are labeled "low fat" or "lean." </p>
