How Much Paracord Do I Need to Make a Bracelet?

Paracord, also known as 550 cord, is a must-have item for any prepper or survivalist. It’s one of the most versatile items you can have in your kit, and it’s especially useful for making bracelets. But how much paracord do you need to make a bracelet?

In this article, we’ll look at the different types of paracord and the amount of cord you’ll need to make a bracelet, as well as how to make the bracelet. Once you understand the basics, you’ll be able to make your own paracord bracelets with ease. 

<h2>What is Paracord?</h2>

Paracord, or 550 cord, is a lightweight and durable nylon rope. It was originally developed by the US military during World War II and is still used today by the military and other outdoor enthusiasts. It’s great for making bracelets, keychains, lanyards, and other items. 

Paracord comes in a variety of colors and sizes. The most common type is type III, which is rated for a breaking strength of 550 pounds. This is why it’s also known as 550 cord. Other types of paracord include type IV, which has a breaking strength of 750 pounds; type V, which has a breaking strength of 1000 pounds; and type VII, which has a breaking strength of 2000 pounds. 

<h2>How Much Paracord Do I Need to Make a Bracelet?</h2>

The amount of paracord you’ll need to make a bracelet depends on the type of bracelet you’re making. Generally, for a basic bracelet, you’ll need between 3 and 5 feet of paracord. If you’re making a more complicated design, you may need more cord. 

It’s also important to note that the amount of paracord you need will also depend on the size of the bracelet. To determine the size of the bracelet, measure your wrist around the widest part. Then add 1 to 1.5 inches to the measurement to get the size of the bracelet. 

For example, if your wrist measures 7 inches around, you’ll need a bracelet that’s 8 to 8.5 inches long. For a bracelet of this size, you’ll need between 4 and 6 feet of paracord. 

<h2>Types of Paracord Bracelets</h2>

There are a few different types of paracord bracelets you can make. The most common type is the Cobra Weave. This type of bracelet is made with a single strand of paracord that is woven together in a series of loops. It’s a relatively simple design, but it’s also strong and durable. 

Another type of bracelet is the King Cobra Weave. This type of bracelet is made with two strands of paracord that are woven together in a more complex pattern. It’s more time-consuming to make, but it’s also more secure and more durable than the Cobra Weave. 

The last type of bracelet is the Fishtail Weave. This type of bracelet is made with two strands of paracord that are braided together in a pattern that looks like a fishtail. It’s the most time-consuming type of bracelet to make, but it’s also the most secure and durable. 

<h2>How to Make a Paracord Bracelet</h2>

Once you’ve determined the type of bracelet you want to make and the amount of paracord you’ll need, you’re ready to start making your bracelet. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making a paracord bracelet: 

<h3>Step 1: Gather Your Materials</h3>

You’ll need paracord, scissors, and a lighter or matches. If you’re making a bracelet with a buckle, you’ll also need a buckle. 

<h3>Step 2: Cut the Paracord</h3>

Measure and cut the paracord to the desired length. 

<h3>Step 3: Tie the Knots</h3>

Tie a series of knots to form the desired design. For a Cobra Weave, start by tying an overhand knot and then weaving the paracord in and out of the knot. For a King Cobra Weave, start by tying an overhand knot and then weaving the two strands of paracord in and out of the knot. For a Fishtail Weave, start by tying an overhand knot and then braiding the two strands of paracord together. 

<h3>Step 4: Attach the Buckle</h3>

If you’re using a buckle, attach it to the end of the bracelet. 

<h3>Step 5: Melt the Ends</h3>

Use a lighter or matches to melt the ends of the paracord. This will help keep the bracelet secure and prevent it from unraveling. 

<h3>Step 6: Wear and Enjoy!</h3>

Your paracord bracelet is now ready to wear! Enjoy your new bracelet and show it off to your friends.
