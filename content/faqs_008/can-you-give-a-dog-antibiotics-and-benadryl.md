<p>It is important to understand that both antibiotics and Benadryl have their place in the care of dogs. Under the right circumstances, both medications can be used safely to treat a variety of conditions. However, it is important to understand the specifics of each medication before administering them to your pet.</p>

<h2>What Are Antibiotics?</h2>

<p>Antibiotics are medications that are used to treat bacterial infections. They work by stopping the growth of bacteria, either by preventing their growth or killing them outright. Antibiotics are typically prescribed for infections of the bladder, skin, ears, and sinuses. However, they can also be used to treat more serious conditions such as those caused by more serious bacteria.</p>

<h2>What Is Benadryl?</h2>

<p>Benadryl is an antihistamine medication used to treat allergies and other conditions, such as hives, itching, and sneezing. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a naturally occurring chemical in the body that causes allergic reactions. Benadryl is commonly used to treat allergies in both humans and animals.</p>
