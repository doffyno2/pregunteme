<p>Subways are an important mode of transportation in major cities around the world. They offer a convenient, cost-effective, and reliable way of getting around, and they are a great way to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution in urban areas. But how many subways are there in the world?</p>

<p>The exact number of subways in the world is difficult to determine, as different countries use different definitions of what counts as a subway. For example, some countries may include light rail systems, metro systems, and underground railway systems in their definition of a subway. In addition, some countries may include urban rail systems, monorail systems, and elevated railways in their definition of a subway.</p>

<p>However, according to the International Association of Public Transport (UITP), there are more than 200 metro systems in operation in cities around the world. The UITP defines a metro system as a “large-scale, rapid transit system, usually running underground and built to transport large numbers of people quickly in metropolitan areas.” This definition excludes light rail systems, urban rail systems, monorail systems, and elevated railway systems.</p>

<p>In the United States alone, there are 37 subway systems in operation in cities such as New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The New York City Subway is the largest system, with 472 stations and more than 850 miles of track.

The London Underground is the oldest and largest system, with 270 stations and more than 400 miles of track. The Paris Metro is the second-largest system, with 303 stations and more than 200 miles of track.</p>
