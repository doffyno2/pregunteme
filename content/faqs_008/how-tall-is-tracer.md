She is a time-jumping adventurer who faces all challenges with the enthusiasm of an expert, making her an invaluable asset to her team. But just how tall is Tracer?

<h2>Why is Tracer's Height Important?</h2>

Tracer’s height is important because it helps to define her character in the game. She is a smaller character, which makes her faster and more agile than her larger opponents. Her size also gives her an advantage when it comes to mobility and maneuverability, as she can quickly move in and out of combat to avoid taking damage. Additionally, her small size makes it easier for her to maneuver in tight spaces, allowing her to access locations that other characters may not be able to reach.
