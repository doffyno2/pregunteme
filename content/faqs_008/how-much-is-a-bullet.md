Bullets are the central component of firearms and ammunition. They are the projectiles that are fired from a gun and are responsible for delivering the lethal force of a firearm. Understanding the different types of bullets and the factors that determine their cost is essential for anyone who is looking to purchase ammunition.

<h2>What is a Bullet?</h2>

A bullet is a metal projectile that is used in firearms and ammunition. Bullets come in all shapes and sizes and vary in weight, caliber, and material. The most common type of bullet is the full metal jacket (FMJ) round. This type of bullet has a distinct metal casing that is made of copper, steel, or lead. The bullet is then filled with propellant, or gunpowder, that propels the bullet out of the barrel of the gun.

<h2>Types of Bullets</h2>

The most common type of bullets are FMJs, which are full metal jacketed rounds. These bullets are typically used in rifles and handguns and are designed to penetrate targets and cause damage. Other types of bullets include hollow points, wadcutters, and frangible bullets. Hollow points are designed to expand upon impact and cause more severe damage to the target. Wadcutters are designed to be more accurate and are often used in target shooting. Frangible bullets are designed to break apart upon impact and are often used for training purposes.

<h2>Factors that Determine the Cost of a Bullet</h2>

The cost of a bullet is determined by several factors, including the type of bullet, the material it is made from, and the manufacturer. The type of bullet will affect the cost, as some bullets, such as hollow points and frangible bullets, are more expensive than FMJs. The material the bullet is made from also affects the cost, as some materials are more expensive than others. The manufacturer of the bullet will also affect the cost, as some manufacturers produce higher quality bullets that are more expensive than others.

<h2>Where to Buy Bullets</h2>

Bullets can be purchased from a variety of different sources, including gun shops, sporting goods stores, and online retailers. Gun shops typically have a wide selection of bullets and ammunition, and they often have knowledgeable staff that can help you find the right type of bullet for your needs. Sporting goods stores typically have a smaller selection of bullets and ammunition, but they can still be a good source for ammunition. Online retailers usually have the largest selection of bullets and ammunition, and they often have the best prices as well.

<h2>How Much Does a Bullet Cost?</h2>

The cost of a bullet varies depending on the type of bullet, the material it is made from, and the manufacturer. FMJ bullets typically cost between 10 and 20 cents per round, while hollow points and frangible bullets can cost between 30 and 50 cents per round. The cost of the bullet can also vary depending on the quantity purchased, with larger quantities typically costing less per round.
