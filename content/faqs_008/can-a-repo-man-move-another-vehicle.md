This will help ensure that the process goes smoothly and that no damage is done to the vehicle. 

<h3>Make Sure the Vehicle is Secure</h3>

When moving another vehicle, it is important to make sure that it is secure. Make sure that the vehicle is properly secured to the tow truck and that all of the doors, windows, and other components are locked and secure. This will help to prevent any theft or damage from occurring during the move.
