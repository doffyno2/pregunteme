How to Call Guatemala from the USA 

Calling Guatemala from the United States is a fairly simple and straightforward process. Whether it’s for business or pleasure, making international calls is now easier than ever with the advent of modern technology. In this guide, we’ll go over the steps you need to take to call Guatemala from the USA and how to avoid any potential pitfalls along the way. 



The first step in making any international call is to understand the country code. Every country has its own unique code, and Guatemala is no different. The country code for Guatemala is 502. If you’re calling from the United States, you will need to dial 011 (the international access code) followed by Guatemala’s country code. At this point, you should have the following: 011-502. 



Once you have the country code in place, the next step is to dial the actual number. This is done by first dialing the area code, followed by the local number. For example, if you were trying to call a number in Guatemala City, you would dial 011-502-2-####-####. Replace the # symbols with the actual number you are trying to call. 



Once you’ve dialed the full number, the next step is to press ‘send’ or ‘dial’ on your phone. At this point, you should hear a ringing sound as the call is sent to the other person. If the person you’re trying to call has their phone turned on, they should hear the ringing as well. 



The next step to consider when making an international call is to understand the different rates that apply. Depending on the type of phone plan you have, you may be charged a different rate for making international calls. It’s important to check with your phone provider to understand any potential fees or charges that may apply. 



One of the best ways to make cheap international calls is to use a VoIP (Voice over IP) service. This type of service allows you to make calls over the internet, rather than over the traditional phone network. There are many benefits to using VoIP, including lower costs, more features, and more flexibility. 



Another option for making international calls is to use calling cards. Calling cards are prepaid cards that allow you to make international calls for a set rate. These cards can be purchased from many stores and online retailers, and they are easy to use. All you have to do is dial the access number on the card, followed by the number you’re trying to call. 



Finally, you can also use apps to make international calls. There are many apps available that allow you to make international calls for a fraction of the cost of traditional phone plans. The great thing about these apps is that they are usually free to download and use. All you need is an internet connection, and you’re good to go.
