<p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits Earth at an average distance of 238,855 miles, or about 30 Earth diameters away. The Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular, but rather elliptical, so the exact distance between Earth and the Moon varies from a minimum of 225,623 miles to a maximum of 252,088 miles. The Moon's distance from Earth is constantly changing, as it revolves around our planet in an elliptical pattern.</p>

<h2>What is the Average Distance From Earth to the Moon?</h2>

<p>The average distance from Earth to the Moon is 238,855 miles, or about 30 Earth diameters away. This distance varies throughout the Moon's orbit, as it moves closer and farther away from Earth.</p>

<h2>What is the Closest Distance From Earth to the Moon?</h2>

<p>The closest distance from Earth to the Moon is 225,623 miles, which is when the Moon is at its perigee (closest approach). This is the point in the Moon's orbit when it is closest to Earth.</p>

<h2>What is the Farthest Distance From Earth to the Moon?</h2>

<p>The farthest distance from Earth to the Moon is 252,088 miles, which is when the Moon is at its apogee (farthest approach). This is the point in the Moon's orbit when it is farthest away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Why Does the Distance From Earth to the Moon Change?</h2>

<p>The distance from Earth to the Moon changes throughout the Moon's orbit because the Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular. Instead, its orbit is slightly elliptical, so the Moon moves closer and farther away from Earth as it goes around in its orbit.</p>

<h2>What is the Orbital Period of the Moon?</h2>

<p>The orbital period of the Moon is 27.32 days, which is the amount of time it takes for the Moon to make one complete orbit around Earth.</p>

<h2>Is the Moon Moving Away From Earth?</h2>

<p>Yes, the Moon is slowly moving away from Earth. This is due to tidal forces between Earth and the Moon. As the Moon orbits Earth, its gravity causes tides in Earth's oceans, which pull on the Moon and cause it to move further away over time.</p>

<h2>How Fast Is the Moon Moving Away From Earth?</h2>

<p>The Moon is currently moving away from Earth at a rate of about 1.5 inches per year. This may not seem like much, but over millions of years, this gradual movement will add up and cause the Moon to move further and further away.</p>

<h2>What Would Happen if the Moon Was Closer to Earth?</h2>

<p>If the Moon was closer to Earth, the tides in Earth's oceans would be much stronger. This would cause more flooding and stronger storms, as well as more frequent and intense earthquakes. It would also affect life on Earth, as plants and animals would need to adapt to the much stronger tides.</p>

<h2>What Would Happen if the Moon Was Farther Away From Earth?</h2>

<p>If the Moon was farther away from Earth, the tides in Earth's oceans would be much weaker. This would cause less flooding and weaker storms, as well as less frequent and less intense earthquakes. It would also affect life on Earth, as plants and animals would need to adapt to the much weaker tides.</p>
