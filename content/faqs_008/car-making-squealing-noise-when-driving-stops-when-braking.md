<p>Driving a car can be a great experience, especially when it is running smoothly and without any issues. However, when a car is making a squealing noise when driving and stops when braking, it can be a cause for concern. Fortunately, there are a few common causes of this problem and they can usually be diagnosed and repaired easily.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Squealing Noise When Driving and Stops When Braking?</h2>

<p>When a car is making a squealing noise when driving and stops when braking, it is usually caused by one of three issues. The first issue is a worn out or loose belt. The belt is responsible for turning the pulley and powering the alternator, air conditioner, power steering, and other components. If the belt is worn out, it will slip and cause a squealing noise when driving and stops when braking. A loose belt can also cause the same issue. The second issue is caused by a worn out or loose brake pad. The brake pad is responsible for stopping the car when the brakes are applied. If the pad is worn out or loose, it will cause a squealing noise when driving and stops when braking. The third issue is caused by a worn out or loose caliper. The caliper is responsible for controlling the movement of the brake pads. If the caliper is worn out or loose, it can cause a squealing noise when driving and stops when braking.</p>

<h2>How Can You Diagnose and Repair a Squealing Noise When Driving and Stops When Braking?</h2>

<p>The first step in diagnosing and repairing a squealing noise when driving and stops when braking is to check the belt. If the belt is loose or worn out, it should be replaced. If the belt is not the issue, then the brake pads and caliper should be inspected. If the brake pads are worn out or loose, they should be replaced. If the caliper is loose or worn out, it should be replaced. Once the parts are replaced, the squealing noise when driving and stops when braking should go away.</p>
