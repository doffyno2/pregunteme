<p>Fifth wheel travel trailers are a great way to enjoy the outdoors without having to invest in a large motorhome. They come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small, lightweight models to massive luxury models. One of the most important considerations when choosing a fifth wheel is the height. It’s important to know the approximate height of the trailer so that you can determine whether it will fit underneath power lines and other obstructions. So, just how tall is a 5th wheel travel trailer?</p>

<h2>The Basics of 5th Wheel Travel Trailers</h2>

<p>Fifth wheel travel trailers are popular with RVers because they offer a lot of space and amenities, but they’re typically smaller and easier to maneuver than other types of RVs. The trailer is connected to the tow vehicle at a point above the rear axle, which helps to distribute the weight of the trailer more evenly than a traditional trailer. This makes it easier to tow and makes it safer on the road. Fifth wheel trailers also have a roomier interior than other types of trailers, because the hitch is located over the truck bed, leaving more living space inside.</p>

<h2>How Tall is a 5th Wheel Travel Trailer?</h2>

<p>The height of a 5th wheel travel trailer can vary depending on the model and the options that are included. Generally speaking, the smallest fifth wheels are usually between 11 and 13 feet tall, while the largest models can be as tall as 15 feet. Some luxury models may even be taller than this. It’s important to measure your chosen model to make sure it will fit under any low-hanging obstructions, such as power lines, on the route you plan to take.</p>

<h2>Advantages of a Taller 5th Wheel Trailer</h2>

<p>While a taller 5th wheel trailer can be more difficult to maneuver and may require a larger tow vehicle, it also offers some advantages. A taller trailer will typically have more headroom, which makes it more comfortable to move around in. In addition, the extra height often allows for more storage space, including cabinets, closets, and shelving. Many taller trailers also have a larger “basement” area, which can be used to store luggage, camping gear, and other items. Finally, a taller trailer will typically be more aerodynamic, which can help improve fuel economy.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of a Taller 5th Wheel Trailer</h2>

<p>The main disadvantage of a taller 5th wheel trailer is that it can be more difficult to maneuver and may require a larger tow vehicle. The extra height also increases wind resistance, which can make it more difficult to tow and can reduce fuel economy. In addition, a taller trailer may have difficulty fitting under low-hanging obstructions, such as power lines, bridges, and overpasses, which can limit the routes you can take. Finally, a taller trailer will be more expensive than a shorter model, as it requires a larger, more powerful tow vehicle.</p>

<h2>How to Measure the Height of a 5th Wheel Trailer</h2>

<p>The easiest way to measure the height of a 5th wheel trailer is to measure from the ground to the highest point on the trailer. This is typically the air conditioner, but it can also be the roof vent or any other protruding object. It’s important to measure the entire height of the trailer, including any accessories or items that may be mounted on the roof. If the trailer is not level, make sure to measure from the highest point. This will ensure that you get an accurate measurement.</p>
