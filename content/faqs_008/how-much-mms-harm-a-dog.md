<p>MMS, or Miracle Mineral Solution, is a type of chlorine dioxide solution that has been marketed as a cure-all for many ailments in humans and animals. Unfortunately, MMS can be dangerous and even deadly if ingested by pets, especially dogs. In this article, we'll discuss the risks and side effects of MMS when it comes to canine health, as well as some of the treatment options available to pet owners who suspect their dog has been exposed to MMS.</p>

<h2>What is MMS?</h2>

<p>MMS is a chlorine dioxide solution that is created by mixing 28 percent sodium chlorite with an acid, such as citric acid or hydrochloric acid. When mixed together, these two compounds create an unstable solution that releases chlorine dioxide gas. This gas is what is known as MMS. It has been promoted as a miracle cure for a variety of ailments, from cancer to autism to malaria.</p>

<h2>What are the Risks of MMS for Dogs?</h2>

<p>MMS is a potentially dangerous substance when ingested by dogs. The most common side effects of MMS ingestion in dogs include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, MMS ingestion can cause chemical burns in the mouth and digestive system, respiratory distress, and even death. In addition, the chlorine dioxide gas can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat.</p>

<h2>How Much MMS Can Harm a Dog?</h2>

<p>It is difficult to determine how much MMS can harm a dog, as each dog is different and can react differently to the same amount of MMS. Generally speaking, any amount of MMS ingested by a dog can be dangerous, and the amount required to cause serious harm can be as little as a few drops. As such, it is always best to err on the side of caution and avoid giving your dog any amount of MMS.</p>

<h2>What Should I Do If My Dog Has Ingested MMS?</h2>

<p>If your dog has ingested MMS, it is important to seek immediate veterinary care. Your vet may be able to induce vomiting to remove any remaining MMS from your dog's system. In more severe cases, your vet may need to administer fluids and provide supportive care. It is also important to bring any remaining MMS to the vet, so they can identify the exact ingredients and determine the best course of action.</p>

<h2>How Can I Prevent My Dog From Ingesting MMS?</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent your dog from ingesting MMS is to avoid giving them any MMS or MMS-containing products. Additionally, it is important to store any MMS products in a secure location, out of reach of your dog. Finally, it is important to watch your dog closely when they are outside, as they may come in contact with MMS-containing products if they are exposed to areas where MMS has been used.</p>
