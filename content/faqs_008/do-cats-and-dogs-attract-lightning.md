<p>It’s a common misconception that cats and dogs attract lightning, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. While lightning is a powerful force of nature, cats and dogs are not capable of attracting lightning. In fact, they are more at risk of being struck by lightning than attracting it. In this article, we’ll explore the truth behind the myth and discuss how to keep your pets safe during a storm.</p>

<h2>Myth vs. Reality: Do Cats and Dogs Attract Lightning?</h2>

<p>Lightning is powerful and unpredictable. It’s an electrical discharge from the atmosphere that can travel up to 60,000 feet and last for up to one second. Lightning is capable of causing extensive property damage, injury, and even death, so it’s understandable why some people might think that cats and dogs can attract it. However, this simply isn’t the case.</p>

<p>The reason why cats and dogs can’t attract lightning is because they don’t conduct electricity. The only materials that can conduct electricity are metals and other similar materials, such as copper or aluminum. Cats and dogs are made up of organic materials, so they don’t act as conductors. Therefore, they are not capable of attracting lightning.</p>

<p>However, that doesn’t mean that lightning can’t harm cats and dogs. Even though lightning can’t be attracted to them, it can still strike them. There have been instances of cats and dogs being struck by lightning and suffering serious injury or death. This is why it’s important to take precautions to keep your pets safe during a storm.</p>

<h2>How to Protect Your Pets During a Storm</h2>

<p>If there’s a storm in your area, the best thing you can do to protect your pets is to bring them indoors. Keep them away from windows and doors, and make sure they are in a safe, enclosed space. This will help protect them from flying debris that can be caused by strong winds and hail.</p>

<p>You should also avoid taking your pets outside during a storm, as this can put them at risk for being struck by lightning. If your pet does go outside, make sure to keep an eye on them and bring them back in as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, if your pet is outdoors during a storm, make sure to give them an extra layer of protection by covering them with a thick blanket or coat. This will help protect them from the wind and rain.</p>
