<h2>Step 1: Draw the Outline</h2>
<p>Using a pencil, draw the outline of the plateau. Start by drawing a rectangle, then draw curved lines along the edges to create a plateau shape. Make sure to keep the edges of the plateau smooth and consistent. You can use a ruler to keep your lines straight.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Add Details</h2>
