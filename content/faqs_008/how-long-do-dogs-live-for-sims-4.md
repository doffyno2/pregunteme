<p>Sims 4 is a popular life simulation video game developed by Maxis and The Sims Studio, and released for Microsoft Windows, MacOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game allows players to create and control virtual people (known as "Sims") and to build and manage their houses and neighborhoods. Sims can have relationships, get jobs, get married, have children, and even die. As such, one of the common questions that players have is: how long do dogs live for Sims 4?</p>

<h2>What is the Average Lifespan of Dogs in Sims 4?</h2>

<p>The average lifespan of a dog in Sims 4 is around 15 Sim days. This is comparable to the average lifespan of a real-life dog, which is around 10 to 13 years. However, the lifespan of a dog in the game can be significantly influenced by how it is cared for, as well as whether or not it is adopted or bought as a puppy.</p>

<h2>How to Increase the Lifespan of a Dog in Sims 4</h2>

<p>There are several ways to increase the lifespan of a dog in Sims 4. The first is to ensure that the dog is well fed and taken care of. This includes feeding the dog a balanced diet, providing regular exercise, and ensuring that the dog receives regular grooming. Additionally, players can purchase a special life-extending elixir from the game's store, which can add a few extra days to a dog's life. Finally, players can adopt an elderly dog, which will start with a shorter lifespan but will still provide years of companionship.</p>

<h2>What Happens When a Dog Dies in Sims 4?</h2>

<h2>Can a Dog Be Revived in Sims 4?</h2>
