<p>A marathon is a long-distance running event that typically covers a distance of 26.2 miles (42.2 kilometers). This distance is often referred to as a “marathon” and is popular among competitive runners and recreational athletes alike. The marathon has become a popular event for charity fundraisers, as well as a major component of many large sporting events around the world.</p>

<p>The marathon is thought to have originated in ancient Greece when a messenger was sent to deliver news of a major battle victory to the Athenian people. The runner, Pheidippides, ran all the way from the site of the battle in Marathon (located 26 miles away) to Athens in order to deliver the news. He is said to have exclaimed “Rejoice! We conquer!” upon his arrival, and then collapsed and died due to exhaustion.</p>

<p>The modern marathon event was first held in 1896 at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in commemoration of Pheidippides’s feat. The course was later standardized to 26.2 miles, and the marathon has become a popular event at many large running competitions around the world.</p>

<p>The marathon is considered a grueling event for even the most experienced runners, and is often used as a physical and mental test for athletes looking to challenge themselves. Distance running is a test of endurance, and many marathons require months of training and preparation for runners to complete the course in a satisfactory time.
