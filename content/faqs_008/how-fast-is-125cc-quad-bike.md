<p>A 125cc quad bike is a popular choice for those who want a bit more power than a smaller bike, but don’t need the speed of a larger engine. 125cc quad bikes are great for recreational riders, and they’re also ideal for those who want to venture off-road. But how fast can a 125cc quad bike go?</p>

<p>The answer depends on a few factors, including the type of engine, the weight of the rider, and the terrain. Generally speaking, a 125cc quad bike can reach speeds of up to 40 mph (64 km/h).
