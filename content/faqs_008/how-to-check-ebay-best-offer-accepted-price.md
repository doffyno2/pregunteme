<h2>What is the eBay Best Offer Feature?</h2>

<p>The eBay Best Offer feature is a great way to negotiate with a seller. It allows buyers to make an offer on an item they’d like to purchase, and sellers can accept, decline, or counter-offer. This feature is especially helpful when trying to get a good deal on an item.</p>

<h2>How to Make a Best Offer on eBay</h2>

<p>Making a best offer on eBay is simple. First, find the item you’d like to buy, and click the “Make Offer” button. Then, enter the amount you’d like to offer for the item, and click “Send Offer.” The seller will then receive your offer and decide whether or not to accept it.</p>

<h2>How to Check eBay Best Offer Accepted Price</h2>

<p>Once you’ve made an offer, you may be wondering how to check the accepted price. To do this, go to “My eBay” and select “Buying.” Here, you’ll see a list of all the items you’ve placed offers on.

<h2>What to Do if Your Offer is Declined</h2>

<p>If your best offer is declined, don’t worry. You still have a chance to negotiate. First, check the seller’s counter-offer. If it’s still too high, you can make another offer.
