Git is a powerful version control system that helps developers collaborate on projects, tracking changes to both code and documentation. It’s a great way to keep track of who made what changes to your project, and when. It can also help you work with teams, allowing you to easily share and collaborate on your work. 

However, when working with Git, you may want to make sure your repo is private or public. In this article, we’ll discuss how to change a Git repo from private to public. 

<h2>What is a Private Repo?</h2>

A private repo is a repository that is not visible to the public. This means that only the people that you have given access to can view the repo, and the repo will not show up in search engine results. However, you can still collaborate on the repo with other users who have been given access.

<h2>What is a Public Repo?</h2>

A public repo is a repository that is visible to everyone. Anyone can view the repo, and it will show up in search engine results. This means that anyone can contribute to the repo, and anyone can make changes to it. This can be great for open source projects, as it allows anyone to contribute and collaborate. 

<h2>How to Change a Private Repo to a Public Repo</h2>

If you’re looking to make your repo public, you’ll need to take a few steps. Here’s how to do it: 

<h3>Step 1: Login to Your Git Account</h3>
