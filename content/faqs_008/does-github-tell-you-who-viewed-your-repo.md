<p>GitHub is an online platform that enables developers to store and share their code with others. It also allows them to collaborate on projects, view each other’s code, and track changes over time. But one question that often comes up is: can you see who is viewing your repository?</p>

<p>The answer is yes and no. GitHub provides the ability to see who has looked at a repository, but it can be difficult to determine who exactly is viewing it. While it’s possible to see who has been “watching” or “starring” a repository – indicating that someone is interested in it – it’s not possible to track who is actually viewing the repository at any given time.</p>

<p>That said, there are ways to get an idea of who is viewing your repository. For example, if someone is “watching” or “starring” your repository, then it’s likely that they are interested in it and may be viewing it more often than someone who hasn’t indicated any interest. Additionally, you can look at the “contributors” page to see which users are actively contributing to the project, as these are likely people who are regularly viewing the repository.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to use various tools to track who is viewing your repository. These tools use a variety of methods, such as browser cookies and IP addresses, to track when someone visits your repository. While these tools are not 100% accurate, they can provide useful insights into the people who are viewing your repository.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while it’s not possible to definitively determine who is viewing your repository, there are a few ways to get an idea of who may be interested. By looking at who is “watching” or “starring” your repository, as well as looking at who is actively contributing to it, you can get an idea of who may be viewing your repository.</p>
