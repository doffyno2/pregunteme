<p>It's no secret that dogs can suffer from skin conditions, just like humans. Many of these conditions, such as fungal infections, can be treated with topical creams, including anti fungal nail creams. But can these creams be used on dogs?</p>

<p>The answer is a bit complicated. Anti fungal nail creams are designed for humans, not animals, and so may contain ingredients that are too harsh for dogs. Additionally, it may be difficult to find the right dosage for your pet, as directions for use are normally intended for humans. That said, there are some anti fungal creams that are specifically designed for dogs, available from your veterinarian or online.</p>

<p>If you do choose to use an anti fungal nail cream on your pup, it's important to consult your veterinarian first. He or she can advise you on the best cream for your particular pet, as well as how to apply it properly and how often.</p>

<p>It's also important to keep in mind that anti fungal nail creams may not be a good choice for some dogs. Dogs with allergies or sensitive skin may be more likely to have a reaction to these creams. It's important to talk to your vet if your pup has any known allergies or skin conditions, as these creams may not be the right choice.</p>

<h2>How to Apply Anti Fungal Nail Cream to Dogs</h2>

<p>Once you have chosen the right cream for your pup, it's important to apply it correctly. As with all topical medications, it's best to apply the cream to a clean, dry area of skin. Before applying the cream, check with your veterinarian to make sure that it is safe to do so. He or she may recommend that you use a protective cream first, such as Vaseline, in order to prevent any irritation.</p>

<p>Once you have applied the cream, make sure to follow the directions exactly. Most creams should be applied twice a day for a period of two to four weeks, depending on the severity of the infection. It's important to apply the cream for the full recommended amount of time, even if the infection seems to be clearing up sooner.</p>
