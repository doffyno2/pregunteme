<p>Vodka is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from grains, potatoes, and/or fruits. It is clear in colour and typically has a low amount of sugar and calories. It is often used to make mixed drinks and can be found in many bars and restaurants. Some people prefer to drink vodka neat or on the rocks, while others like to mix it with other juices and liquors. No matter how you drink it, it is important to know how many calories are in each serving, so you can make informed decisions when it comes to drinking and nutrition.</p>

<h2>Calorie Content of Vodka</h2>

<p>Vodka generally contains about 65 calories per 1.5 ounce shot. That means that a 2 ounce shot of vodka contains approximately 97 calories.

However, it is still a relatively low-calorie option when compared to other types of alcohol, such as liqueur, which contains about 200 calories per 1.5 ounces.</p>

<h2>Carbohydrates in Vodka</h2>

<p>Vodka is a low-carbohydrate beverage, with about 0.4 grams of carbohydrates per 1.5 ounces. This means that a 2 ounce shot of vodka contains about 0.6 grams of carbohydrates. It is important to note that many of the flavored vodkas may contain additional carbohydrates, as they are often sweetened with sugar or other types of carbohydrates. Make sure to check the label of the vodka you are drinking to determine the exact carbohydrate content. </p>

<h2>Alcohol Content of Vodka</h2>

<p>Vodka generally contains between 35 and 50 percent alcohol by volume (ABV). That means that a 2 ounce shot of vodka contains between 0.7 and 1 ounce of alcohol. It is important to drink responsibly and be aware of the alcohol content of any alcoholic beverage you consume. </p>
