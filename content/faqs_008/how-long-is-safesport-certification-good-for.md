<p>In order to become a member of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) or any of its National Governing Bodies (NGBs), you must first become certified by the United States Center for SafeSport (USCS) through a process called SafeSport Certification. This certification offers protection to athletes, coaches, and other participants involved in USOPC activities. It includes training on recognizing, responding to, and reporting allegations of abuse, misconduct, and other forms of prohibited conduct.</p>

<p>SafeSport Certification is required for all levels of USOPC and NGB membership. This means that if you have been a member of the USOPC or an NGB for any time period, you must have a valid SafeSport Certification. All applicants for USOPC membership and all members of NGBs must pass the SafeSport certification process. This certification is good for two years, and can be renewed for an additional two-year period.</p>

<p>SafeSport Certification is not only required for USOPC and NGB members, but also for any organization or individual who works with youth in sport-related activities. This includes coaches, officials, and other sport professionals who are not members of the USOPC or an NGB, but who still need to be certified in order to legally participate in sport-related activities.</p>

<h2>What Is the SafeSport Certification Process?</h2>

The online training course is designed to educate those involved in sport-related activities on the prevention of abuse, misconduct, and other forms of prohibited conduct. This course is free to take and can be completed online. It is also available in Spanish.</p>

<p>The background check is a more extensive process and is required for all USOPC and NGB members. The background check is conducted by Verified Volunteers, an independent third-party organization. This background check includes a criminal background check, a check of the National Sex Offender Registry, and a review of the applicant’s personal history. This background check is required for all USOPC and NGB members and must be renewed every two years.</p>

<h2>What Is the Cost of SafeSport Certification?</h2>

<p>The cost of SafeSport Certification varies depending on which level of certification you are seeking. For USOPC and NGB members, the cost of the certification process is $30. For organizations or individuals seeking certification for sport-related activities, the cost is $10. The cost of the background check is included in the cost of the certification.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of SafeSport Certification?</h2>

<p>SafeSport Certification helps ensure that those involved in sport-related activities are properly trained and knowledgeable about the prevention of abuse, misconduct, and other forms of prohibited conduct. Certification also helps protect athletes, coaches, and other participants from potential harm. It is also a requirement for USOPC and NGB members, which helps promote a safe and positive environment for young athletes.</p>

<h2>Does SafeSport Certification Expire?</h2>

<p>Yes, SafeSport Certification must be renewed every two years. It is the responsibility of the individual or organization to keep track of their certification expiration date and to renew it in a timely manner.</p>

<h2>What Happens if My SafeSport Certification Expires?</h2>

<p>If your SafeSport Certification expires, you will no longer be able to legally participate in sport-related activities. It is the responsibility of the individual or organization to renew their certification in a timely manner. If your certification has expired, you will need to go through the SafeSport Certification process again before you can legally participate in sport-related activities.</p>

<h2>What Are the Consequences of Failing to Renew SafeSport Certification?</h2>
