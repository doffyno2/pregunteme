<p>Flip flops are a type of sandal that are incredibly popular during the summer months. They are inexpensive, comfortable, and come in a variety of styles. Unfortunately, they can also be a bit uncomfortable and rub against your toes. To avoid this issue, you need to break in your flip flops and make sure they fit properly. Here's how to do it.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Wear Your Flip Flops Around the House</h2>

<p>The first step in breaking in your flip flops is to wear them around the house. This will give them a chance to start conforming to the shape of your feet. Make sure that you wear them for at least an hour each day for a week. This will give them a chance to really adjust to your feet and make them more comfortable.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Wear Thick Socks with Your Flip Flops</h2>

<p>If your feet are especially sensitive, you may find that wearing thick socks with your flip flops helps. This provides an extra layer of cushioning between your feet and the sandals and can help to reduce the amount of rubbing that occurs. Make sure that you wear the socks for at least an hour each day to ensure that the sandals start to stretch.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Use a Leather Softener</h2>

<p>If you want to speed up the process of breaking in your flip flops, you can use a leather softener. This will help to make the material softer and more flexible, which will make it more comfortable to wear. Simply spray the softener onto your flip flops and then let them sit overnight. This will help to make them more comfortable and easier to break in.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Wear a Second Pair of Flip Flops</h2>

<p>If you are still having trouble breaking in your flip flops, try wearing a second pair of sandals. This will give your feet a chance to get used to the fit of the sandals without having to suffer any discomfort. You can switch between the two pairs of sandals throughout the day to ensure that your feet don't become too sore.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Visit a Shoe Store</h2>

<p>Finally, if all else fails, you may want to visit a shoe store and speak to a professional. They will be able to help you find a pair of flip flops that fit your feet properly and are comfortable to wear. This is especially important if you are going to be wearing your flip flops for extended periods of time.</p>
