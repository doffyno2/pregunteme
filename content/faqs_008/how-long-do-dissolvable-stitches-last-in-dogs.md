When your pup needs surgery, you'll want to know when you can expect the stitches to dissolve. Dissolvable stitches, or sutures, are designed to gradually degrade over time, allowing your pup's body to heal naturally. But how long do dissolvable stitches last in dogs?

Knowing how long your pup's dissolvable stitches will last can help you plan for their care and ensure their wound is healing properly. In general, the time it takes for dissolvable stitches to completely dissolve is anywhere from 10 to 14 days in dogs.

<h2>What Are Dissolvable Stitches?</h2>

Dissolvable stitches, also known as absorbable sutures, are a type of surgical thread used to close wounds. Unlike traditional stitches, which require removal after the wound has healed, absolvable stitches are designed to degrade over time.

The absorbable sutures are made of a material called polyglycolic acid (PGA) or polyglactin (Vicryl). These materials are specifically designed to break down gradually as the wound heals.

<h2>How Do Dissolvable Stitches Work?</h2>

Dissolvable sutures are designed to slowly break down in the body over time. They are usually placed under the skin, and the body's enzymes and fluids slowly break them down. As the sutures are degraded, the wound is slowly closed.

The process of breaking down the sutures can take anywhere from 7 to 14 days in dogs, depending on the size of the wound and the type of suture used.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Dissolvable Stitches?</h2>

Using dissolvable stitches is often preferred over traditional sutures because it eliminates the need for a second surgical procedure to remove the stitches. This can save time, money, and stress for both you and your pup.

Dissolvable stitches can also reduce the risk of infection in the wound, since there is no need to disturb the wound to remove the sutures. They can also reduce scarring, since the sutures are not removed.

<h2>What Are the Risks of Dissolvable Stitches?</h2>

Although dissolvable stitches are generally safe and effective, there are some risks associated with them. For example, if the sutures are not placed properly, they may not dissolve evenly. This could cause the wound to take longer to heal or even cause the wound to re-open.

There is also a risk of infection if the sutures are not placed properly or if the wound is not kept clean. If your pup develops any signs of infection around the wound, such as redness, swelling, or discharge, contact your veterinarian.

<h2>How Long Do Dissolvable Stitches Last in Dogs?</h2>

In general, the time it takes for dissolvable stitches to completely dissolve is anywhere from 10 to 14 days in dogs. This time frame may vary depending on the size of the wound and the type of suture used. 

It is important to follow your veterinarian's instructions for wound care, which may include keeping the wound clean and dry and checking for signs of infection.
