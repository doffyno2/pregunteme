<p>The Faron Tower is one of the most stunningly beautiful locations in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Located in the Faron region of Hyrule, the tower is surrounded by lush green forests and a beautiful lake. Climb to the top of the tower and you'll be rewarded with stunning views of the surrounding landscape. But to reach the top of the tower, you'll need to use some of Link's special abilities.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>
<p>In order to climb the Faron Tower, you'll need a few specific items. First and foremost, you'll need the Paraglider, which can be obtained after completing the quest "Trial of the Sword" in the game. You'll also need the Sheikah Slate's Cryonis ability, which can be unlocked after completing the Shrines at the Great Plateau.

<h2>Climbing the Tower</h2>
<p>Once you have all of the necessary items, it's time to begin your climb. Start by making your way to the base of the tower, where you'll find a large, stone platform. Stand on this platform and face the tower, then use the Cryonis ability to create a couple of ice pillars directly in front of you. These pillars will act as stepping stones, allowing you to climb up the side of the tower.</p>

<p>Once you've reached the first level of the tower, you'll need to create another set of ice pillars in order to continue your ascent. As you make your way higher and higher, you'll eventually come to a ledge that's too high to reach. At this point, use the Paraglider to glide across to the next section of the tower. Once you've reached the top, you'll be rewarded with stunning views of the surrounding landscape.</p>
