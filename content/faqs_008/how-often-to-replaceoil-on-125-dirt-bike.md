<p>When you own a dirt bike, it's important to keep up with regular maintenance to ensure that it continues to run smoothly. One of the most important maintenance tasks is to change the oil. But how often should you replace the oil on a 125 dirt bike?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on a few factors, such as the type of bike, the type of oil used, and the riding conditions. Generally speaking, most 125 dirt bikes should have their oil changed every 10 hours of riding time. However, if you ride in more extreme conditions, such as in mud, sand, or water, you may need to change the oil more often. It's also important to note that some manufacturers may recommend changing the oil more or less often than the 10-hour standard.</p>

<p>Before you change the oil on your 125 dirt bike, you'll need to make sure that you have all the necessary supplies. This includes the oil filter, oil, and any other supplies that may be required. You'll also need a few tools, such as a socket wrench, a pair of pliers, and a funnel. Once you have all the supplies and tools ready, you're ready to begin.</p>

<h2>Steps for Changing Oil on a 125 Dirt Bike</h2>

<p>Changing the oil on a 125 dirt bike is a fairly straightforward process. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Bike</h3>

<p>The first step is to prepare the bike. This includes making sure that all the necessary supplies are ready and that the bike is in a secure, level position. You should also check to make sure that there is no fuel or oil in the engine.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Drain the Oil</h3>

<p>Once the bike is prepared, you can begin draining the oil. To do this, you'll need to locate the oil drain plug and remove it. Make sure to use a container to catch any spilled oil. Once all the oil has been drained, you can replace the drain plug.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Replace the Oil Filter</h3>

<p>Next, you'll need to replace the oil filter. This can be done by using a socket wrench to remove the old filter and then installing the new one. Be sure to use a new seal to ensure a tight fit.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add New Oil</h3>

<p>Once the oil filter has been replaced, you can add the new oil. Make sure to use the correct type and viscosity for your dirt bike. You can add the oil by using a funnel and pouring it into the engine.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Check for Leaks</h3>

<p>Finally, you'll need to check for any oil leaks. You can do this by running the engine and looking for any signs of leaking oil. If you find any leaks, you'll need to replace the gaskets or seals to ensure a proper seal.</p>

<p>Once you've finished these steps, you can start riding your 125 dirt bike again. Just remember to keep up with regular oil changes to ensure that your engine continues to run smoothly.</p>
