<p>As a pet parent, you want to make sure your pup is getting the best nutrition possible. You may be wondering how much homemade dog food to feed your pup. The answer depends on a few factors, such as your pup’s age, size, activity level, and health. Making homemade dog food can be a wonderful way to ensure your pup is getting a balanced diet, but it’s important to understand the basics before you start.</p>

<h2>How Much Homemade Dog Food Should I Feed My Dog?</h2>

<p>When it comes to feeding homemade dog food, the amount you should feed your pup depends on a few things. First, consider your pup’s age.

For example, if your pup weighs 30 pounds, they should get around 1 to 1.5 cups of homemade dog food per day, split into two meals.</p>

<p>It’s also important to consider your pup’s activity level. If your pup is very active, they may require a bit more food than a pup who spends most of their time lounging around.
