<p>Flying with an infant can be an intimidating experience, especially if you’re a first-time parent. Delta Airlines offers one of the most comprehensive policies for flying with an infant, which includes the ability to add a lap infant to your flight. Here’s what you need to know about adding a lap infant to your Delta flight.</p>

<h2>Who Qualifies as a Lap Infant?</h2>

<p>A lap infant must be younger than two years old and fly with an adult who is at least 18 years old. The adult must accompany the lap infant for the entire trip and provide the necessary documentation, including a valid form of identification, at the airport. Lap infants do not occupy their own seat, and Delta Airlines does not charge a fee to add a lap infant to your flight.</p>

<h2>What Documents are Required?</h2>

<p>When you check in for your flight, you will be required to provide proof of the lap infant’s age. This can be done with a birth certificate or passport. You may also be required to provide a valid form of identification, such as a driver’s license, to prove that you are the legal guardian of the lap infant. Additionally, you will need to provide the child’s full name and date of birth.</p>

<h2>How Do I Add a Lap Infant to My Flight?</h2>

<p>You can add a lap infant to your flight when you book your ticket through the Delta website or when you check in for your flight. When booking your ticket, you will be prompted to select the number of passengers, including infants. When you check in for your flight, you will need to provide the necessary documentation, including proof of the infant’s age. You may also be asked to provide a valid form of identification.</p>

<h2>Do Lap Infants Receive a Ticket?</h2>

<p>No, lap infants do not receive a ticket. The lap infant will travel on the adult’s ticket and be listed as an “infant in lap” on the reservation. The adult will be responsible for providing any necessary documentation, such as a birth certificate or passport, at the airport.</p>

<h2>Are Lap Infants Allowed On International Flights?</h2>

<p>Yes, lap infants are allowed on international flights, but you may need to provide additional documentation. In some cases, the lap infant may be required to have a visa and/or have a passport of their own. You should check with the country’s embassy to determine what documentation is required for the lap infant.</p>

<h2>Are Lap Infants Allowed in First or Business Class?</h2>

<p>Yes, lap infants are allowed in first or business class, as long as the adult accompanying the infant is traveling in the same class. You may be asked to provide additional documentation, such as a birth certificate or passport, at the airport.</p>

<h2>Do Lap Infants Receive Meal Services?</h2>

<p>No, lap infants do not receive meal services. If you would like to purchase a meal for the lap infant, you can do so at the airport or onboard the flight. The cost of the meal will be the same as a regular meal for an adult.</p>

<h2>Do Lap Infants Receive Carry-On Baggage Allowance?</h2>

<p>Yes, lap infants are allowed one carry-on bag, in addition to one personal item. The carry-on bag must be smaller than the adult’s carry-on bag and must fit in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of the adult. All carry-on items must be stored in the overhead bin or under the seat during takeoff and landing.</p>

<h2>Do Lap Infants Receive Checked Baggage Allowance?</h2>

<p>Yes, lap infants are allowed one checked bag if the adult accompanying the infant is traveling with checked baggage. The checked bag must be within the airline’s size and weight restrictions and must be checked in at the airport.</p>

<h2>Are Lap Infants Allowed On Flights With Connecting Flights?</h2>

<p>Yes, lap infants are allowed on flights with connecting flights. However, the adult accompanying the infant must remain with the infant for the entire flight and the infant must remain in the adult’s lap for the duration of the flight. Additionally, the adult may be required to provide additional documentation, such as a passport or birth certificate, for the infant at the airport.</p>

<h2>Do Lap Infants Have to Wear a Seatbelt?</h2>

<p>Yes, lap infants must wear a seatbelt while the seatbelt sign is on. The seatbelt must be worn around the adult’s waist and over the infant’s lap. The airline will provide a seatbelt extender if needed.</p>

<h2>Are Lap Infants Allowed To Use Car Seats?</h2>

<p>Yes, lap infants are allowed to use car seats on Delta flights. The car seat must meet all safety requirements and be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The car seat must also fit into the seat and be secured with the aircraft seatbelt. The adult must remain seated with the lap infant at all times during the flight.</p>
