<p>Lexapro is a common prescription medication used to treat depression and anxiety. It is a type of antidepressant known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which works by increasing the amount of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood. </p>

<p>While Lexapro is generally effective in treating depression and anxiety, it can also have some undesirable side effects, including changes to your menstrual cycle. This article will discuss the effects of Lexapro on the menstrual cycle and what you can do if your menstrual cycle is affected by the medication.</p>

<h2>What is the Menstrual Cycle?</h2>

<p>The menstrual cycle is a cycle of physical and hormonal changes that a woman’s body goes through each month. It consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. During the follicular phase, the lining of the uterus thickens in preparation for a possible pregnancy. At the same time, the body releases hormones like estrogen and progesterone. During ovulation, an egg is released from the ovaries. The luteal phase occurs after ovulation, and it is during this time that the body prepares for a possible pregnancy. If the egg is not fertilized, the lining of the uterus is shed, resulting in a menstrual period.</p>

<h2>How Does Lexapro Affect the Menstrual Cycle?</h2>

<p>Lexapro can affect the menstrual cycle in a variety of ways. It can delay ovulation, leading to a longer than normal menstrual cycle. It can also cause a decrease in the amount of estrogen in the body, leading to lighter or shorter periods. Some women may also experience an increase in bleeding during their periods.</p>

<p>In addition, some women may experience changes in their cervical mucus. The cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle and is an important indicator of fertility. When taking Lexapro, the cervical mucus may become thicker or more difficult to interpret, making it harder to track your fertility.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do if Your Menstrual Cycle is Affected by Lexapro?</h2>

<p>If you experience changes to your menstrual cycle while taking Lexapro, the first thing you should do is talk to your doctor. Your doctor can help you determine if the changes are due to the medication or something else. They can also recommend ways to manage the changes, such as adjusting your dose or switching to a different medication.</p>

<p>In addition, it’s important to track your menstrual cycle while taking Lexapro. This will help you understand how the medication is affecting your cycle so that you can make adjustments as needed. You can track your menstrual cycle using a menstrual tracking app, a paper calendar, or other methods.</p>

<p>It’s also important to take care of yourself while taking Lexapro. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and exercise regularly. This will help ensure that your body is in its best condition to handle the changes that the medication may cause.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Lexapro is a commonly prescribed medication for depression and anxiety, and it can have an effect on your menstrual cycle. If you experience changes to your menstrual cycle while taking Lexapro, it’s important to talk to your doctor. They can help you determine if the changes are due to the medication and recommend ways to manage them.
