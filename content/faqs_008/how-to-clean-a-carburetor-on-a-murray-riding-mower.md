<p>Having a clean carburetor is essential for the proper functioning of a Murray riding mower. Without it, the engine may run rough, consume more fuel, and refuse to start. Fortunately, cleaning a carburetor on a Murray riding mower is a relatively simple procedure, and can be done in a few steps.</p>

<h2>Tools You Will Need</h2>

<p>Before you start, make sure you have the right tools. You will need a Phillips head screwdriver, a pair of needle-nose pliers, a small flat-head screwdriver, and a can of carburetor cleaner. You will also need a container of gasoline and a rag.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Remove the Carburetor from the Mower</h2>

<p>The first step is to remove the carburetor from the mower. Use the Phillips head screwdriver to loosen the screws that hold the carburetor in place. Once you have loosened the screws, you can then use the needle-nose pliers to remove the carburetor from the engine. Make sure to keep track of all the screws and pieces that you remove.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Disassemble the Carburetor</h2>

<p>Once the carburetor is off the mower, you can begin to disassemble it. Use the flat-head screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the carburetor together. You will need to remove the top cover of the carburetor, as well as the bowl, the float, and the jets. Place all of these parts in the container of gasoline and set aside.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Clean the Carburetor Parts</h2>

<p>The next step is to clean the parts that you removed from the carburetor. Use the rag to wipe away any dirt or debris from the parts. Then use the carburetor cleaner to spray the parts and remove any buildup or gunk. Make sure to completely dry all of the parts before reassembling the carburetor.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Reassemble the Carburetor</h2>

<p>Once the parts are clean, you can begin to reassemble the carburetor. Place the float and jets back in their respective places. Then use the flat-head screwdriver to tighten the screws that hold the carburetor together. Make sure that all of the parts are secure before you move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Reinstall the Carburetor</h2>

<p>The last step is to reinstall the carburetor on the mower. Use the needle-nose pliers to position the carburetor in place. Then use the Phillips head screwdriver to tighten the screws that hold the carburetor in place. Once you have finished, you can then start up the mower and make sure that it is running properly.</p>
