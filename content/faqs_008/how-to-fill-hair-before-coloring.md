If you’re looking to try a new hair color, then the first step is to prepare your hair for the color change. Properly prepping your hair before coloring ensures that the color is even and lasts longer. Here’s how to prepare your hair for coloring.

<h2>Step 1: Choose the Right Hair Color</h2>

The first step when it comes to prepping your hair for coloring is to make sure you choose the right hair color. Consider the current color of your hair, the color you’d like to achieve, and any underlying tones you may have. If you’re unsure, then you can consult with a professional hair stylist to help you choose the right color.

<h2>Step 2: Cleanse Your Hair</h2>

Once you’ve chosen the right hair color, the next step is to cleanse your hair. This step is important as it helps to remove any dirt, oil, or product build-up from the hair so it’s ready for the color change. You should use a sulfate-free shampoo for best results.

<h2>Step 3: Deep Condition Your Hair</h2>

After cleansing your hair, the next step is to deep condition it. This will help to restore any moisture that has been lost due to shampooing and will also help to make the hair softer and more manageable. You should use a deep conditioning treatment and leave it on for at least 15 minutes before rinsing it out.

<h2>Step 4: Use a Clarifying Treatment</h2>

The next step is to use a clarifying treatment before you color your hair. This helps to remove any buildup that could prevent the hair color from taking properly. You can use a clarifying shampoo or an apple cider vinegar rinse. 

<h2>Step 5: Trim Your Hair</h2>

Before you color your hair, it’s also important to trim it. This helps to get rid of any split ends or damaged hair and will help the color to take and look even. 

<h2>Step 6: Protect Your Hairline</h2>

Finally, it’s important to protect your hairline before you color your hair. You can do this by applying a barrier cream or Vaseline around the hairline. This will help to prevent the color from staining the skin.
