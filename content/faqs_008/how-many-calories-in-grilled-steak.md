Grilled steak is one of the most popular dishes that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. It is a great source of protein and other important nutrients, and it is also a tasty and satisfying meal. But how many calories are in grilled steak?

<h2>How Many Calories Are in Grilled Steak?</h2>

The exact calorie count in grilled steak depends on several factors, including the cut of meat, the cooking method and the amount of fat included. Generally speaking, a 3-ounce serving of grilled sirloin steak contains about 174 calories, while a 3-ounce serving of grilled rib-eye steak contains about 197 calories. 

Of course, the calorie count can vary depending on the cut of steak and how it is cooked. For example, a 3-ounce serving of grilled flank steak contains about 211 calories, while a 3-ounce serving of grilled tenderloin steak contains about 177 calories. In addition, steak that is cooked with added fat, such as butter or oil, will have a higher calorie count than steak that is cooked without added fat. 

<h2>What Nutrients Does Grilled Steak Provide?</h2>

In addition to providing calories, grilled steak is also a good source of several important nutrients. A 3-ounce serving of grilled sirloin steak contains about 12 grams of protein, 1.7 grams of fat and 0.4 grams of carbohydrates. It also contains about 30 percent of the daily recommended intake of iron and about 10 percent of the daily recommended intake of zinc. 

Grilled steak is also an excellent source of B vitamins, particularly B12, which helps to maintain healthy levels of red blood cells. Additionally, steak is a good source of selenium, a mineral that helps to support the immune system, and creatine, an energy-producing compound that helps to fuel muscles during exercise. 

<h2>Tips for Preparing and Cooking Grilled Steak</h2>

When preparing grilled steak, it is important to purchase high-quality steak that is fresh and has not been previously frozen. It is also important to allow the steak to come to room temperature before cooking, as this will help ensure that it cooks evenly. Additionally, it is important to season the steak with salt and pepper before cooking, as this will help to bring out the flavor of the meat. 

When cooking steak, it is important to use a very hot grill or pan to ensure that the steak cooks quickly and evenly. It is also important to ensure that the steak does not overcook, as this can cause it to become tough and dry. To check for doneness, it is best to use an instant-read thermometer and cook the steak until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit for medium-rare or 160 degrees Fahrenheit for medium.
