Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe and can be caused by a variety of allergens, including dust, pollen, mold, and certain foods.

The testing process for dog allergies includes a physical examination, skin prick test, and blood test. During the physical examination, the veterinarian will examine the dog’s skin and look for signs of allergies, such as redness and itching. The skin prick test involves placing a small amount of the allergen on the dog’s skin and then pricking the surface with a needle.
