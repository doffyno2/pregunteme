<h2>What Are Fences in Minecraft?</h2>

Fences are blocks found in the world of Minecraft that can be used to create barriers and enclosures. They are made out of wood and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

<h2>What Are Spiders in Minecraft?</h2>

Spiders are hostile mobs that can be found in various biomes in the world of Minecraft.
