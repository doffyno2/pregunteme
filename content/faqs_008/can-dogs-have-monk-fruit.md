Can Dogs Have Monk Fruit?



Monk fruit, also known as luo han guo, is a type of small, green melon native to Southeast Asia. It has a long history of being used in traditional Chinese medicine, and is now becoming popular as a low-calorie sweetener. But can dogs have monk fruit, too?

<h2>What Is Monk Fruit?</h2>

Monk fruit is a small, green melon that grows on tropical vines in Southeast Asia. It has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine, and has also been incorporated into tea and other beverages.
