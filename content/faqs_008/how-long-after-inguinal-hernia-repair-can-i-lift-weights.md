<p>Inguinal hernias are a common condition, affecting millions of people each year.

Surgery is often necessary to repair the hernia, but it's important to understand the recovery process and how long it will take before you can safely start lifting weights again.</p>

<h2>What Is an Inguinal Hernia?</h2>

<p>An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents through an opening in the abdominal wall. It is a common condition, occurring in both men and women.

<p>The treatment options for an inguinal hernia depend on the severity of the hernia and the patient's overall health. In some cases, a hernia can be repaired with a simple outpatient procedure.
