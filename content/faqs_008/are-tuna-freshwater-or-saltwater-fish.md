Tuna is one of the most popular types of fish in the world, and many people are curious to know whether it is a freshwater or saltwater fish. The answer is not as simple as it may seem. Tuna is actually a saltwater fish, but there are several species of tuna that can tolerate freshwater and may even live in both freshwater and saltwater environments.

<h2>What are Tuna?</h2>

Tuna are a type of fish that belongs to the family Scombridae, which is the same family as mackerels, bonitos, and billfishes. Tuna are found in tropical and temperate waters around the world and are an important source of food for many people. They are fast-swimming predatory fish, which means they feed on other fish, squid, and crustaceans. 

<h2>Are Tuna Freshwater Fish?</h2>

Tuna are not typically considered to be freshwater fish. Most species of tuna prefer saltwater environments and will not survive in freshwater habitats. However, there are some species of tuna that can tolerate freshwater and may even live in both freshwater and saltwater environments. These species include the freshwater yellowfin tuna, which is found in South America, and the Australian longfin tuna, which is found in New Zealand. 

<h2>What Habits Do Tuna Have?</h2>

Tuna typically live in open oceans and coastal waters and migrate long distances between different areas of the ocean. They are highly migratory fish, meaning they move from one area to another in search of food and shelter. They are also highly social and can form large schools of hundreds of individuals.

Freshwater tuna can survive in both freshwater and saltwater habitats, whereas saltwater tuna can only survive in saltwater habitats.
