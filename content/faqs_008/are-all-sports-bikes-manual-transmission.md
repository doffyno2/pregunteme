<p>Sports bikes have been all the rage in the biking world for quite some time. The allure of speed, power, and agility they offer has made them a popular choice with riders looking for a thrilling ride. But with all the different models, styles, and options available, it can be difficult to decide which bike is the best for you. One thing to consider is whether or not all sports bikes come with manual transmission.</p>

<p>The answer to this question is both yes and no. While manual transmission is an option for some sports bikes, there are also many models that come with automatic transmissions as well. It all depends on the manufacturer and the model of bike you are looking at. Some manufacturers, like Honda and Yamaha, offer both manual and automatic options for their sports bikes.</p>

<h2>What is Manual Transmission?</h2>

<p>Manual transmission is a type of transmission system that uses a clutch to change gears. The clutch is operated by the rider, and by pressing the clutch pedal, the rider can change gears and control the speed of the bike. Manual transmission is often preferred by riders who want more control over their bike, as it gives them more options for when and how to shift gears.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of Manual Transmission</h2>

<p>Manual transmission offers a number of advantages, including better fuel efficiency, increased control over speed and acceleration, and increased overall performance. On the other hand, manual transmission also has some drawbacks. Manual transmission can be harder to use than automatic transmission, and it also requires more maintenance, as the clutch needs to be replaced more often. Additionally, manual transmission can also be more expensive than automatic transmission.</p>

<h2>Are All Sports Bikes Manual Transmission?</h2>

While manual transmission is an option for some sports bikes, there are also many models that come with automatic transmissions as well.

<h2>Which is Better: Manual or Automatic?</h2>

<p>Ultimately, the choice of which transmission system is better for you will depend on your riding style and preferences. Manual transmission offers more control over the speed and acceleration of the bike, and is often preferred by riders who want to be in full control of their bike.
