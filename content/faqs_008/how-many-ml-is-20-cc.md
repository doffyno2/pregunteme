<p>Milliliters (mL) and cubic centimeters (cc) are both units of measurement for volume. While they may appear to be different measurements, they are actually both equivalent to one another, as one milliliter is equal to one cubic centimeter. This means that 20 cc is equivalent to 20 mL.</p>

<p>This conversion is most often used when measuring liquids, as the size of a milliliter is equal to the size of a cubic centimeter. This is because milliliters and cubic centimeters are both units of volume, which is the measure of the amount of space something takes up. When measuring liquids, one milliliter is equal to one cubic centimeter, meaning that 20 cc is equal to 20 mL.</p>

<p>The process of converting cc to mL can be done by multiplying the number of cubic centimeters by 1, since 1 ml is equal to 1 cc. This means that 20 cc is the same as 20 mL. This conversion can also be done using a calculator or by using a conversion chart. However, it is important to note that this conversion is affected by temperature and pressure, as the volume of a liquid can change based on these factors.</p>

<p>The most common use for this conversion is when measuring liquids. For example, when measuring medication for a patient, the dosage is often measured in milliliters. However, some medical professionals may refer to the dosage as cc instead. In this case, it is important to be aware that 20 cc is equal to 20 mL.</p>

<h2>What Is CC?</h2>

<p>Cubic centimeters (cc) is a measure of volume, which is the amount of space something takes up. This unit of measurement is often used when measuring liquids, as it is the same size as a milliliter. One cc is equal to one milliliter, meaning that 20 cc is equal to 20 mL. </p>

<p>Cubic centimeters are also most often used in the medical field, especially when measuring medication for a patient. However, it is important to note that this unit of measurement can also be affected by temperature and pressure, as the volume of a liquid can change based on these factors.</p>

<h2>What Is ML?</h2>

<p>Milliliters (mL) is another measure of volume, which is the amount of space something takes up. This unit of measurement is often used when measuring liquids, as it is the same size as a cubic centimeter. One ml is equal to one cc, meaning that 20 ml is equal to 20 cc.</p>

<p>Milliliters are also most often used in the medical field, especially when measuring medication for a patient. However, it is important to note that this unit of measurement can also be affected by temperature and pressure, as the volume of a liquid can change based on these factors.</p>

<h2>What Is the Difference Between CC and ML?</h2>

<p>The main difference between cc and ml is that cc is a unit of volume, while ml is a unit of mass. This means that cc is used to measure the volume of a liquid, while ml is used to measure the mass of a liquid. Despite this difference, one cc is equal to one ml, meaning that 20 cc is equal to 20 ml.</p>

<h2>What Is the Conversion for CC to ML?</h2>

<p>The conversion for cc to ml is 1 cc = 1 ml. This means that 20 cc is the same as 20 ml. This conversion can be done using a calculator or by using a conversion chart. However, it is important to note that this conversion is affected by temperature and pressure, as the volume of a liquid can change based on these factors.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What Is CC?</h3>

<p>Cubic centimeters (cc) is a measure of volume, which is the amount of space something takes up. This unit of measurement is often used when measuring liquids, as it is the same size as a milliliter. One cc is equal to one milliliter, meaning that 20 cc is equal to 20 mL.</p>

<h3>What Is ML?</h3>

<p>Milliliters (mL) is another measure of volume, which is the amount of space something takes up. This unit of measurement is often used when measuring liquids, as it is the same size as a cubic centimeter. One ml is equal to one cc, meaning that 20 ml is equal to 20 cc.</p>

<h3>What Is the Difference Between CC and ML?</h3>

<p>The main difference between cc and ml is that cc is a unit of volume, while ml is a unit of mass. This means that cc is used to measure the volume of a liquid, while ml is used to measure the mass of a liquid. Despite this difference, one cc is equal to one ml, meaning that 20 cc is equal to 20 ml.</p>

<h3>What Is the Conversion for CC to ML?</h3>

<p>The conversion for cc to ml is 1 cc = 1 ml. This means that 20 cc is the same as 20 ml. This conversion can be done using a calculator or by using a conversion chart. However, it is important to note that this conversion is affected by temperature and pressure, as the volume of a liquid can change based on these factors.</p>

<h3>What Is the Common Use for Measuring CC to ML?</h3>
