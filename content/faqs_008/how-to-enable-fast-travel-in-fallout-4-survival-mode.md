<p>Fallout 4 is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released in 2015. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world and follows the story of a survivor as they explore the fictional wasteland of the Commonwealth. In the game, players can choose to play in either the Survival mode or the Normal mode. In the Survival mode, players are challenged to survive without the use of fast travel, a feature that allows the player to instantly move between explored locations.</p>

<p>Fast travel is a great way to quickly get around the expansive wasteland of Fallout 4, but it is not available in the Survival mode. This can make exploring the wasteland more difficult for players who are used to being able to warp between locations. Fortunately, there are some ways to enable fast travel in Fallout 4 Survival mode.</p>

<h2>Using Console Commands to Enable Fast Travel</h2>

<p>The first way to enable fast travel in Fallout 4 Survival mode is to use console commands. Console commands are special commands that can be used to manipulate the game and its settings. To use console commands, players must first open the console by pressing the tilde (~) key. Once the console is open, players can enter the following command to enable fast travel in Survival mode:</p>

<p><b>player.setav fasttravel 1</b></p>

<p>This command will allow players to use fast travel in Survival mode. It is important to note that this will only work if the player has already explored the locations they wish to fast travel to. If the player has not already explored the locations, then fast travel will not be available.</p>

<h2>Using Mods to Enable Fast Travel</h2>

<p>Another way to enable fast travel in Fallout 4 Survival mode is to use mods. Mods are modifications created by fans of the game that can be installed to alter or add new features to the game. There are a number of mods available that can enable fast travel in Survival mode. These mods can be downloaded and installed from the Nexus Mods website. Once installed, these mods will allow players to fast travel in Survival mode just as they would in the Normal mode.</p>

<h2>Using a Third-Party Tool to Enable Fast Travel</h2>

<p>The final way to enable fast travel in Fallout 4 Survival mode is to use a third-party tool. There are a number of third-party tools available that can be used to manipulate the gameâ€™s settings. These tools can be used to enable various features, including fast travel. It is important to note that the use of third-party tools can be risky and may lead to unexpected results. As such, it is recommended that players use these tools with caution.</p>
