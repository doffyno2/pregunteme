<h2>Steps to Fill a Gas Can</h2>

<p>Filling a gas can at the gas station is a relatively simple process, but there are a few steps you should always follow to ensure safety. Follow these steps to fill your gas can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Put on safety glasses and gloves. These will protect your eyes and skin from any fuel splashes or spills.</li>
  <li>Locate the fuel pump and insert your credit card or cash into the machine to activate it.</li>
  <li>Attach the fuel pump nozzle to the gas can spout. Make sure the nozzle is securely attached.</li>
  <li>Set the fuel pump nozzle to the desired fuel type, usually indicated by a number or letter.</li>
  <li>Pull the trigger on the fuel pump nozzle and fill the gas can. Make sure to keep the nozzle on the spout to avoid any fuel spillage.</li>
  <li>When the gas can is full, release the trigger and carefully remove the fuel pump nozzle from the gas can.</li>
  <li>Turn off the fuel pump and remove your card or cash.</li>
  <li>Securely cap the gas can and store it in a safe place.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety Tips When Filling a Gas Can</h2>

<p>Besides following the steps above, there are some extra safety tips you should keep in mind when you are filling a gas can at the gas station:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only fill the gas can in a well-ventilated area. This will reduce the chance of an explosion or fire if gasoline fumes become trapped in the gas can.</li>
  <li>Do not overfill the gas can. This can cause fuel leakage or spills that could lead to a fire or explosion.</li>
  <li>Never smoke or use any form of open flame when filling a gas can. This could cause a fire or explosion.</li>
  <li>Always make sure the nozzle is securely attached to the gas can spout before filling. This will prevent gasoline from spilling on the ground and reduce the risk of an explosion.</li>
  <li>Keep the gas can away from any sources of heat. This includes the sun, heaters, and open flames. Gasoline fumes are highly flammable and can ignite if exposed to heat.</li>
