When shopping for a new blanket, one of the most important factors to consider is size. While blankets come in a variety of shapes and sizes, twin size blankets are among the most popular. But what exactly is the size of a twin size blanket? This article will go over the dimensions of a twin size blanket, as well as offer some tips on how to choose the right size blanket for your bed or other sleeping space.

<h2>What Is the Size of a Twin Size Blanket?</h2>

The size of a twin size blanket is typically 66 inches by 90 inches, though some manufacturers may have slightly different measurements. This size is ideal for a single adult or child, as it fits comfortably over a twin size mattress. It can also be used on a larger bed, such as a double or queen size mattress, although it may not cover the entire bed.
