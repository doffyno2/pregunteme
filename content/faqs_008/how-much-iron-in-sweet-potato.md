Sweet potatoes are a delicious and nutritious vegetable that is enjoyed by people all over the world.

<h2>Nutrition Facts of Sweet Potato</h2>

One large sweet potato (about 7 ounces) contains 103 calories, 2.2 grams of protein, 0.2 grams of fat, 24.6 grams of carbohydrates, 6.6 grams of dietary fiber and 2.9 milligrams of iron. 

<h2>Types of Sweet Potato</h2>

Sweet potatoes come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common type of sweet potato is the orange-fleshed variety, which is what most people are familiar with. However, there are also white-fleshed sweet potatoes, as well as purple and red-fleshed varieties. The nutritional content of sweet potatoes can vary depending on the type. For example, the white-fleshed sweet potato contains more iron than the orange-fleshed variety. 

<h2>How Much Iron Is In Sweet Potato?</h2>

The amount of iron in sweet potato can vary depending on the type. The orange-fleshed variety contains 2.9 milligrams of iron per one large potato (7 ounces). The white-fleshed variety contains 4.2 milligrams of iron per one large potato. The purple and red-fleshed varieties contain slightly more iron than the orange-fleshed variety, with 3.4 milligrams of iron per one large potato. 

<h2>Why Is Iron Important?</h2>

Iron is an essential mineral for the body. It helps to transport oxygen throughout the body, and it is also important for a healthy immune system. Iron is also important for energy production and cognitive development. Without adequate amounts of iron, the body can become weak and susceptible to illness. 

<h2>How Much Iron Do You Need?</h2>

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron is 8 mg per day for adults over the age of 19. For children and adolescents, the RDA varies depending on age. That being said, the RDA for iron is generally higher for women than men, since women tend to lose more iron each month during menstruation. 

<h2>Foods Rich In Iron</h2>

In addition to sweet potatoes, there are many other foods that are rich in iron. These include red meat, poultry, seafood, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Iron-fortified cereals, breads, and other grains are also good sources of iron. 

<h2>How To Increase Iron Absorption</h2>

Iron from plant-based sources, such as sweet potatoes, is not as easily absorbed as iron from animal sources. To increase iron absorption, it is important to eat iron-rich foods with foods that are high in vitamin C. Vitamin C helps the body to absorb iron more effectively. 

<h2>Risks Of Excessive Iron Intake</h2>

It is important to note that iron is a mineral, and it can be dangerous to consume too much of it. Too much iron can lead to iron toxicity, which can cause nausea, vomiting, and even organ damage. It is important to speak to a doctor before taking iron supplements, as the body can only absorb a certain amount of iron at a time.
