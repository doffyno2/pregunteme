Fishing lures are some of the most iconic and sought-after collectibles in the world. Whether you’re a passionate angler or a collector looking to make a profit, old fishing lures can be an incredibly rewarding investment. But how much are old fishing lures actually worth?

In this article, we’ll take a look at the factors that determine the value of old fishing lures, what makes them so popular with collectors, and the best ways to make sure you’re getting the best deal. Let’s dive in!

Lures that are larger in size, have more intricate details, and have a unique shape tend to be worth more than their more generic counterparts.
