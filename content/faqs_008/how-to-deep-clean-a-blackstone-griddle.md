<p>A Blackstone griddle is a great way to enjoy delicious meals that are cooked quickly and easily. You can make breakfast, lunch, and dinner all on the same griddle, and with a little care and maintenance, you can keep your griddle in peak condition. But over time, the griddle can accumulate grease and food particles, leaving it looking dull and dirty. To ensure your griddle is always looking its best, it's important to deep clean it every few months. Here's how to do it. </p>

<h2>Gather Your Materials</h2>
<p>Before you begin your deep cleaning, you'll need to gather some supplies. You'll need a non-abrasive scrubbing pad, a bucket of warm, soapy water, a sponge, a soft cloth, some baking soda, and some cooking oil. Make sure you have all of your supplies before you begin the cleaning process.</p>

<h2>Scrub Away Grease and Grime</h2>
<p>Start by dampening your scrubbing pad with warm water and then sprinkle it with some baking soda. Use the pad to scrub away any grease or grime that has accumulated on your griddle. Make sure to scrub in a circular motion, starting from the center and working your way outward. Once you are finished, rinse off the baking soda with a wet sponge.</p>

<h2>Clean With Soapy Water</h2>
<p>Next, fill your bucket with warm, soapy water and dip your sponge in it. Use the sponge to wipe down the griddle, making sure to get into all of the nooks and crannies. Rinse off the soap with a wet cloth and then dry the griddle with a soft cloth.</p>

<h2>Apply a Layer of Cooking Oil</h2>
<p>Once you have finished cleaning your griddle, it's time to apply a layer of cooking oil. This will help to protect the griddle from rust and corrosion. Use a paper towel to apply a thin layer of oil to the griddle, making sure to get into all of the corners and crevices. Allow the oil to sit for several minutes before wiping off any excess.</p>
