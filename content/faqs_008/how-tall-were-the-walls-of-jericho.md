The walls of Jericho have been estimated to have been as high as 15 meters (50 feet) tall, making them one of the tallest man-made structures in the ancient world.

<h2>The History of the Walls of Jericho</h2>

<h2>What Do We Know About the Walls of Jericho?</h2>

<p>Most of our knowledge of the walls of Jericho comes from the biblical story of their collapse. According to the Bible, the walls of Jericho were destroyed when the Israelites marched around the city for seven days, blowing trumpets and shouting. The walls of Jericho were believed to have been so tall that the Israelites could not climb over them, and so the walls were weakened by the sound of the trumpets and collapsed. Archaeological evidence has also suggested that the walls were around 15 meters (50 feet) tall, which would have made them very difficult to climb.</p>

<p>The walls of Jericho have also been the subject of much speculation, with some believing that the walls were destroyed by an earthquake or other natural forces. However, the archaeological evidence suggests that the walls were destroyed by the Israelites, rather than by natural forces.</p>
