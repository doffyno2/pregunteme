How Stats Work in Octopath Traveler 


Octopath Traveler is a role-playing video game developed by Square Enix, in collaboration with Acquire, and published by Nintendo. The game was released in July 2018 for the Nintendo Switch and has since become a huge hit with gamers, who appreciate its unique visuals, art style, and deep, complex storyline. Octopath Traveler is a turn-based RPG, where players take control of one of eight unique characters, each with their own unique abilities and stories. As players progress through the game, they'll be able to build up their characters' stats, allowing them to take on tougher and more challenging enemies. In this article, we'll take a look at how stats work in Octopath Traveler, and what players need to know to make the most of their characters' stats.


Stats are the numerical values that represent a character's strength, speed, and other attributes. In Octopath Traveler, there are five main stats that players need to keep track of: HP, Strength, Defense, Magic, and Speed. HP (or Hit Points) is a measure of a character's overall health and determines how much damage they can take before being knocked out. Strength determines the amount of physical damage a character can do, while Defense determines how much physical damage they can take. Magic is a measure of a character's magical abilities, and determines how much magical damage they can do and take. Finally, Speed determines how quickly a character can move and act in battle.


One of the main ways to increase stats in Octopath Traveler is by using Path Actions. Path Actions are special abilities that each character has, based on their job or class. By using the right Path Action at the right time, players can increase the stats of their characters. For example, the Merchant job has the Haggle Path Action, which can be used to increase a character's Strength. The Apothecary job has the Mix Path Action, which can be used to increase a character's Magic. It's important to note that each character can only use Path Actions specific to their job or class, so players need to be sure to use the right Path Action for the right character when trying to increase their stats.

In addition to Path Actions, characters can also increase their stats by using items such as weapons and armor. Weapons and armor can give characters bonuses to their stats, such as increased Strength or Defense. Finally, characters can increase their stats by gaining levels through battle. Every time a character gains a level, their stats will increase slightly.


Stats play an important role in the battles of Octopath Traveler. HP acts as a character's health, and if it reaches zero, the character will be knocked out of battle. Strength, Defense, Magic, and Speed all determine how much damage a character can do and take, as well as how quickly they can act in battle. Higher stats mean that characters will be able to do more damage and take less damage, making them more effective in battle.


Stats are an important part of Octopath Traveler, and understanding how they work and how to increase them is essential for success in the game. Players can increase their stats using Path Actions, items, and by gaining levels. Stats play an important role in battle, as they determine how much damage a character can do and take, as well as how quickly they can act. By understanding how stats work, players can make the most of their characters and become more successful in the game.
