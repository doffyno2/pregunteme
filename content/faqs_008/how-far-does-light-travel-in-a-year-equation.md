Light is the fastest thing in the universe, travelling at a staggering speed of 299,792,458 metres per second. That's fast enough to circle the Earth 7.5 times in one second! But how far does light travel in a year? To answer this question, we need to take a look at the equation for the speed of light.

<h2> Speed of Light Equation </h2>

The equation for the speed of light is the product of the speed of light in a vacuum, c, and the number of metres in a second, m/s. This equation can be written as:

<p><b>c = m/s</b></p>

If we want to find out how far light travels in one year, we can simply multiply the speed of light in a vacuum, c, by the number of seconds in a year. As there are 31,536,000 seconds in a year, we can write our equation as:

<p><b>Distance = c x 31,536,000</b></p>

To calculate the distance light travels in one year, we simply need to substitute the value for c into our equation. As c = 299,792,458 m/s, we can write our equation as:

<p><b>Distance = 299,792,458 m/s x 31,536,000</b></p>

Plugging this into our calculator we can find out that the distance light travels in one year is 9.46 x 1015 metres! That's a lot of distance!
