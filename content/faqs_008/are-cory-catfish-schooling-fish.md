<p>Corydora catfish, or Corys, are among the most popular freshwater aquarium fish. The Corydoras genus consists of over 170 species, ranging in size from 2-4 inches in length. They are found in a variety of habitats throughout South America, and many species are commonly kept in home aquariums. The most popular Corys are the bronze, panda, albino, and peppered cory, which are all schooling fish.</p>

<p>Corys are a shoaling species, meaning they prefer to live in groups and school together. Schooling is a natural behavior for fish, and it helps them to feel more secure and relaxed. Corys are typically peaceful, non-aggressive fish and they do not have any special requirements for other fish species to school with them. In fact, they are often kept with a variety of other freshwater species in community aquariums.</p>

<p>Corys do best when kept in groups of at least six individuals. A larger group of twelve or more fish is even better. When kept in a large enough group, Corys will school together and display natural schooling behavior. They will swim together in synchronized patterns, often swimming in circles around the tank. This schooling behavior is especially apparent when the fish are startled or excited.</p>

<h2>What Do Corys Eat?</h2>

<p>Corys are omnivores, which means they will eat both plant and animal matter. In the wild, they feed on a variety of small aquatic invertebrates, such as insect larvae, worms, and crustaceans. In the home aquarium, Corys will accept a variety of prepared foods, such as sinking pellets, algae wafers, and frozen or freeze-dried bloodworms. They should also be offered a variety of live or frozen foods, such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and tubifex worms.</p>

<p>Corys have very small mouths, so they should be fed small, sinking foods that they can easily consume. It is important to provide a variety of foods to ensure that they receive a balanced diet. Feed your fish two to three times a day, providing only as much as they can consume in two minutes.</p>

<h2>Are Corys Suitable for Beginner Aquarists?</h2>

<p>Corys are an excellent choice for beginner aquarists. They are hardy fish that are easy to care for and can tolerate a wide range of water conditions. They are also peaceful, non-aggressive fish that can be kept with a variety of other freshwater species. The only caveat is that Corys should be kept in groups of at least six individuals, so you will need a larger aquarium if you plan to keep a school of these fish.</p>

<h2>Do Corys Need Special Care?</h2>

<p>Corys are generally undemanding fish that require minimal care. They prefer a well-maintained aquarium with a temperature of 72-79 degrees Fahrenheit and a pH of 6.0-7.5. They also need access to plenty of oxygen, so be sure to provide adequate filtration and aeration. Corys are bottom feeders, so they should be provided with a substrate that allows them to forage for food. They will also appreciate plenty of hiding places, such as driftwood, rocks, and caves.</p>
