<p>Bourbon is a type of whiskey distilled in the United States, made from a mash of at least 51% corn, and aged in new charred oak barrels. It has a distinct flavor, and is often served neat or on the rocks. But if you are watching your weight, you may be wondering how many calories in 2 oz of bourbon?</p>

<p>The answer is that there are roughly 121 calories in 2 oz of bourbon, depending on the brand and proof. Bourbon is not as calorie-dense as other spirits, such as vodka or rum. In comparison, 2 oz of vodka contains about 105 calories, while 2 oz of rum contains about 110 calories.</p>

<h2>How Is Bourbon Made?</h2>

<p>Bourbon is made by fermenting a mash of at least 51% corn, along with other grains such as wheat, rye, and malted barley. The grains are ground into a flour and combined with water to form a mash. Yeast is then added to the mash to begin the fermentation process, which produces alcohol and flavor compounds.</p>

<p>Once fermentation is complete, the liquid is distilled to remove impurities and increase the alcohol content. The bourbon is then aged in new charred oak barrels for at least two years, which gives it its distinctive flavor. Finally, the bourbon is bottled and ready to be enjoyed.</p>

<h2>What Is The Alcohol Content Of Bourbon?</h2>

<p>The alcohol content of bourbon varies greatly, depending on the brand and proof. Generally speaking, most bourbons contain between 40-50% alcohol by volume, though some brands may be higher or lower. Regardless of the proof, the amount of alcohol in a standard 2 oz serving of bourbon is roughly 30 ml, or 1.2 fl oz.</p> 

<h2>What Are The Health Benefits Of Drinking Bourbon?</h2>
