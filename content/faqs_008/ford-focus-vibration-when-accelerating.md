<p>The Ford Focus is a popular car among drivers, but it can be unsettling when the car begins to vibrate when you accelerate. This issue is usually caused by a few different issues, and can be easily fixed with a few simple repairs. In this article, weâ€™ll discuss the causes of a Ford Focus vibration when accelerating, and how to fix them.</p>

<h2>What Causes Ford Focus Vibration When Accelerating?</h2>

<p>The most common cause of a Ford Focus vibration when accelerating is a problem with the engine mounts. The engine mounts are what hold the engine in place and can wear out over time. When they wear out, they can cause the engine to shift and cause the car to vibrate when accelerating. Other causes of a Ford Focus vibration when accelerating include a problem with the drivetrain, worn suspension components, or an imbalanced wheel.</p>

<h2>How to Fix a Ford Focus Vibration When Accelerating</h2>

<h3>1. Check the Engine Mounts</h3>

<p>If the engine mounts are worn, they will need to be replaced. To do this, you will need to jack up the car and remove the old engine mounts. Once the old engine mounts are removed, you can install the new ones. Make sure to use the correct torque when tightening the bolts to ensure a secure fit.</p>

<h3>2. Check the Drivetrain</h3>

<p>If the drivetrain is causing the vibration, it will need to be inspected and repaired. This can be done by a qualified mechanic. They will check for worn or damaged parts and replace them if necessary. If the drivetrain is in good condition, the issue may be an imbalanced wheel or worn-out suspension components.</p>

<h3>3. Inspect the Wheels and Suspension</h3>

<p>If the wheels are imbalanced or the suspension components are worn, they will need to be checked and repaired. A qualified mechanic can check the wheels for any issues and balance them if necessary. They can also inspect the suspension components and replace them if necessary.</p>
