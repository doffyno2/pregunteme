When it comes to measuring whiskey, there’s a lot of confusion. How much whiskey is in a shot? Is one ounce the same as one shot? How many ounces are in one shot of whiskey? These are all questions that often come up when ordering drinks at a bar or mixing drinks at home. The answer to these questions depends on the type of whiskey, the size of the pour, and the amount of ice used.
