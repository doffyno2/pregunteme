What to Look for When Buying Bottled Water at Trader Joe's?

When buying bottled water at Trader Joe's, there are a few things you should keep in mind. Here are some tips for making sure you get the best possible water:

1. Check the Label: Make sure to check the label of any bottled water you buy at Trader Joe's, as labels can tell you a lot about the quality of the water. Look for words like “purified”, “spring”, “mineral”, or “sparkling”, as these indicate the type of water. Also, look for words like “filtered” or “ultra-filtered”, as these indicate the water has been treated to remove any impurities.

2. Look for Recyclable Packaging: Many brands of bottled water come in recyclable packaging, which is better for the environment. Look for bottles made out of plastic, aluminum, or glass, as these can be easily recycled.

3. Check the Source: If possible, try to buy bottled water that is sourced from a local spring or other natural source. This will help ensure that the water is of the highest quality and will taste the best.

4. Avoid Artificial Sweeteners: If you are looking for a flavored sparkling water, try to avoid any brands that contain artificial sweeteners. These can be harmful to your health and can negatively affect the flavor of the water.

Tips for Making Sure You Get the Best Quality Water

1. Store in a Cool, Dry Place: To ensure your bottled water stays fresh and has a good taste, it is best to store it in a cool, dry place. This will help keep the water from becoming too warm or too cold, which can affect the taste.

2. Refrigerate Before Drinking: If possible, try to refrigerate your bottled water before drinking it. This will help keep it cold and will also help keep it from tasting flat.

3. Avoid Sunlight: Sunlight can cause the water to become warm and can also affect the taste. To avoid this, try to store your bottled water in a cool, dark place.

4. Check the Expiration Date: Make sure to check the expiration date on any bottled water you buy. If the water is past its expiration date, it is best to discard it and buy a new one.
