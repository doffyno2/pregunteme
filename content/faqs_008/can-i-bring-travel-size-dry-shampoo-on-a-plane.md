Traveling by plane can be a stressful experience for some people, especially when you are trying to figure out what you can and cannot bring on the plane. It is important to be aware of the rules and regulations for what is allowed on board an aircraft to ensure a safe and comfortable flight for everyone. One item that is often a source of confusion for travelers is dry shampoo. Can you bring travel-size dry shampoo on a plane? 

<h2>The TSA Guidelines for Travel Size Dry Shampoo</h2>

The TSAâ€™s guidelines for what is allowed on board an aircraft are very specific and travelers should familiarize themselves with the rules before heading to the airport. According to the TSA, you can bring travel-size dry shampoo on a plane as long as it is in a container that contains 3.4 ounces (100ml) or less. The container must be able to fit in a quart-sized baggie and must be placed in the baggie before being placed in the security bins. The TSA also recommends that travelers put all of their liquids, gels, and aerosol cans in their quart-sized baggie to make sure they are not causing any issues during the screening process.

<h2>What is Dry Shampoo?</h2>

Dry shampoo is a type of product that is used to clean and freshen hair without the use of water. It is typically made of either cornstarch or rice flour, which is then mixed with oils and fragrances to absorb excess oil and give hair a clean, fresh scent. Dry shampoo is applied to the roots of the hair, where it absorbs the excess oil, leaving the hair looking and feeling cleaner.

<h2>Benefits of Using Dry Shampoo</h2>

Using dry shampoo has many benefits for travelers. It is a great way to freshen up after a long day of traveling, as well as a convenient way to keep your hair looking clean and fresh. Dry shampoo also helps to absorb excess oil from the scalp, which can help reduce greasiness and make your hair look and feel healthier. Additionally, it is a great way to revive limp, lifeless hair and give it a boost of volume.

<h2>How to Use Dry Shampoo</h2>

Using dry shampoo is simple and easy. First, shake the container to evenly distribute the product in the container. Then, using your fingers, massage the product into the roots of your hair, focusing particularly on the areas where you tend to get the most greasy. Let the product sit for a few minutes before brushing it out with a comb or brush.

<h2>Where to Buy Travel Size Dry Shampoo</h2>

Travel size dry shampoo is available at most drugstores, beauty supply stores, and some grocery stores. It is also available online at sites like Amazon and eBay. When shopping for travel size dry shampoo, it is important to check the container size to make sure it is within the TSA guidelines for what is allowed on board an aircraft.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Traveling with dry shampoo can be a great way to ensure that your hair looks and feels clean and fresh throughout your trip. As long as the container is 3.4 ounces (100ml) or less, you can bring travel-size dry shampoo on a plane. Be sure to check the TSA guidelines for what is allowed on board an aircraft before heading to the airport.
