Can Fish Be Non-Kosher?


One of the dietary laws that are important to many religious Jews is to follow a kosher diet. This means that only food that is deemed to be kosher may be consumed. This includes fish, and many people wonder if there are any types of fish that are not considered to be kosher.

<h2>What Does it Mean for a Fish to be Kosher?</h2>

In order for a fish to be considered kosher, it must have both of the following characteristics:

• It must have fins and scales.
• It must be eaten with its head, tail and fins intact.

The Torah states that only fish with fins and scales may be eaten, so any fish that does not have these characteristics is not considered to be kosher.

<h2>Which Fish are Not Kosher?</h2>

Any fish without fins and scales cannot be eaten by those following a kosher diet. This includes sharks, catfish, sturgeon, and eels. Additionally, some types of shellfish, such as lobster, shrimp, and crabs are also not considered to be kosher.

<h2>What About Fish That Have Both Fins and Scales?</h2>

There are some fish that have both fins and scales, but are still not considered to be kosher. This includes swordfish and sturgeon, as well as certain types of salmon, such as Atlantic salmon. These fish are not considered to be kosher because their fins and scales are not considered to be “true” fins and scales.

<h2>What Fish Are Considered Kosher?</h2>

All other fish that have both fins and scales are considered to be kosher. This includes tuna, halibut, herring, cod, carp, and mackerel. Additionally, certain types of salmon, such as wild salmon, are also considered to be kosher.

<h2>Can Farmed Fish Be Kosher?</h2>

Yes, farmed fish can be kosher as long as they meet the same requirements as wild-caught fish. This means that they must have both fins and scales, and they must be eaten with their head, tail, and fins intact.
