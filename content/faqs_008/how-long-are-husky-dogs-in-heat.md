<h2>What You Need to Know About Huskies and Heat Cycles</h2>

Huskies, like all other canines, have an estrus cycle, or heat cycle. This is the time when a female dog is ready to mate and reproduce. During this time, her body will produce hormones that can affect her behavior and make her more receptive to mating.

<h2>How Long Does a Heat Cycle Last?</h2>

A husky’s heat cycle can last anywhere from two to four weeks. During this time, she will be particularly receptive to mating and will be more likely to attract male dogs. For this reason, it’s important to keep an eye on your husky during her heat cycle and make sure she is kept away from any males.
