<p>Bungee jumping is an adrenaline-filled activity that can be incredibly thrilling, but it's important to be aware of the risks involved. While it may be tempting to take a leap of faith and jump off a bridge or tall building, bungee jumping is a potentially dangerous activity, and it's important to understand the risks involved before taking the plunge.</p>

<p>Bungee jumping is a form of extreme sports that involves jumping from a high structure such as a bridge or tall building while attached to an elastic cord. The cord is usually made of latex or nylon and is designed to stretch and absorb the shock of the jumper's fall. Although bungee jumping is an exciting and thrilling experience, it can also be very dangerous if not done properly.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risks of Bungee Jumping?</h2>

<p>The most common risks associated with bungee jumping include head, neck, and spinal injuries, as well as broken bones and other serious injuries. In some cases, the shock of the fall can be too great for the cord, leading to a sudden and potentially fatal stop. Additionally, if the cord is not properly secured, it could come loose during the jump, causing the jumper to suffer a more severe injury. Finally, if the jumper is not properly trained, they could make a mistake that could lead to serious injury or death.</p>

<h2>How Many People Die From Bungee Jumping?</h2>

<p>It is difficult to accurately estimate how many people die from bungee jumping each year, as most deaths are not reported. However, the American Journal of Sports Medicine has reported that between 1992 and 2002, there were an estimated 11 bungee jumping fatalities in the United States alone. Additionally, the British Medical Journal reported that between 1993 and 2003, there were 6 fatalities in the United Kingdom. While these numbers may seem small, it's important to remember that every death is preventable.</p>

<h2>What Can Be Done to Reduce the Risk of Injury or Death?</h2>

<p>The best way to reduce the risk of injury or death while bungee jumping is to take the necessary precautions. Bungee jumping should only be done under the supervision of professionals who are experienced and qualified to provide safety instruction and assistance. It is important to make sure that the cord is properly secured and that the jumper understands the risks before they jump. Additionally, it is important to wear the appropriate protective equipment, such as a helmet and padding.</p>
