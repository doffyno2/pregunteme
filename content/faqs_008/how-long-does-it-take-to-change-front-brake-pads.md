Whether you are a seasoned car enthusiast or just a regular driver, it is important to know how to take care of your automobile.

<h2>What Are the Front Brake Pads?</h2>

Front brake pads are a critical part of any car's braking system. They are typically made up of a metal backing plate with a friction material attached to its surface. This is designed to help the car slow down and stop. When the brake pedal is applied, the pads press against the rotors of the car, creating friction that slows the car down. Over time, these brake pads wear down and must be replaced.

<h2>How Long Does It Take to Change Front Brake Pads?</h2>

The exact amount of time it takes to change front brake pads will depend on the make and model of your car and your own skill level. However, in general, it should take no more than two hours for an experienced mechanic to complete the job. For those who are less experienced, it could take four or more hours. 

<h2>Tools and Supplies Needed</h2>

Before you start the process, it is important to make sure you have the right tools and supplies. You will need a jack, jack stands, wrenches, a flathead screwdriver, calipers, and new pads. If you are using a hydraulic brake system, you will also need a brake bleeder and brake fluid. 

<h2>Step by Step Guide to Changing Front Brake Pads</h2>

1. Start by jacking up your car and securing it with jack stands.
2. Remove the wheel and tire from the car.
3. Remove the calipers from the rotors. This is typically done with a flathead screwdriver.

Disc brakes use a disc-shaped rotor that is attached to the wheel hub and rotates with the wheel. The brake pads press against the rotor, creating friction that slows the car down. Drum brakes use a drum-shaped rotor that is located inside the wheel hub. The brake shoes press against the inside of the drum, creating friction that slows the car down.
