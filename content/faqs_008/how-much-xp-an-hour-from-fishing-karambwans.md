Fishing Karambwans is a popular method for gathering food and experience points (XP) in the MMORPG game Old School Runescape. This activity is particularly useful for players who are looking to level up their Fishing skill quickly and efficiently. In this article, we'll discuss how much XP an hour from fishing Karambwans and what methods you can use to maximize your XP gains.

<h2>What is Fishing?</h2>

Fishing is a skill in Old School Runescape that allows players to catch fish, crabs, and other sea creatures. Fishing requires the use of a fishing rod and bait, and can be done in rivers, lakes, and the sea. Different types of fishing rods and baits will yield different types of fish, with bigger and more rare fish being caught with higher-level rods and bait.

<h2>What is Karambwan Fishing?</h2>

Karambwan fishing is a specific type of fishing in which players use Karambwan Vessels to catch Karambwans. These vessels can be bought from the Fishing Guild shop in Port Khazard. Karambwans can only be caught in the waters of the River Lum, and require level 65 Fishing to catch.

<h2>What is the XP rate for Fishing Karambwans?</h2>

The XP rate for fishing Karambwans is approximately 30,000 XP per hour. This rate is slightly faster than the XP rate for regular fishing (approximately 26,000 XP per hour), which makes Karambwan fishing a good method for leveling up the Fishing skill quickly.

<h2>What methods can I use to maximize my XP gains?</h2>

There are several methods that players can use to maximize their XP gains when fishing Karambwans. The first is to use the highest level fishing rod and bait that you can. This will increase your chances of catching higher level Karambwans, and therefore increase your XP gains. 

Another method is to use a fishing boost. This is an item that can be bought from a fishing shop that will temporarily increase the XP rate for fishing Karambwans. 

Finally, players can also use the Fishing Guild shop to buy Karambwan Vessels in bulk, which can help to reduce the amount of time spent fishing and therefore increase the XP rate.
