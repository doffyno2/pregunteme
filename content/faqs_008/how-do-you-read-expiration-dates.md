Expiration dates appear on all sorts of perishable items, from food to medicine. It is important to understand how to properly read them so that you can determine when something is safe to consume and when it is not. In this article, we will explain how to read expiration dates and why they are important.

<h2>What do Expiration Dates Mean?</h2>

Expiration dates are used to indicate when a product is no longer safe or effective to use. This can vary depending on the product, so it is important to understand the particular expiration date for the item you are using. Generally, expiration dates are printed on the container of the item, such as a box of cereal or a bottle of medicine.

<h2>What do the Numbers Mean on Expiration Dates?</h2>

Expiration dates are generally printed in a specific format, such as “MMDDYY” or “MM/DD/YY”. The first two numbers indicate the month, the next two indicate the day, and the last two indicate the year. So, for instance, “101220” would indicate that the item expires on October 12th, 2020. 

<h2>How to Read Expiration Dates on Food Items</h2>

The expiration date on food items is usually referred to as the “best before” date. This indicates that the food is still safe to consume after the date, but it may not be at its freshest or most flavorful. It is important to check the expiration date on food items such as dairy, bread, deli meats, and other perishables to ensure they are still safe to consume.

<h2>How to Read Expiration Dates on Medicine</h2>

The expiration date on medicine is more important than the expiration date on food items. This is because the effectiveness of the medicine can diminish after the expiration date. It is important to use medicine that has not expired, as taking expired medication can be dangerous.

<h2>What if the Expiration Date has Passed?</h2>

If the expiration date has passed, it is important to check the item in question to determine if it is still safe to consume. If it is food, it may still be safe to eat, although it may not taste as fresh or be as flavorful. If it is medicine, it is important to check with a doctor before taking the medication, as it may no longer be effective.

<h2>What are the Benefits of Checking Expiration Dates?</h2>

Checking expiration dates can help ensure that you are consuming products that are safe and effective. This can help prevent food poisoning, as well as ensure that any medication you take will be effective. By understanding how to read expiration dates and checking them regularly, you can help keep yourself and your family safe.
