<h2>What is Pitting on Aluminum Rims?</h2>

Pitting on aluminum rims is a common occurrence that can occur due to a variety of reasons. Pitting is the formation of small pits on the surface of the aluminum rims, which can make them look unsightly and decrease their effectiveness. Pitting can be caused by exposure to harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, a lack of maintenance, or even just driving around on rough roads. Pitting can be a serious problem for aluminum rims and can cause them to become weak and corroded if not addressed.
