Flying with children can be a daunting task. It’s even more stressful if you don’t have the right identification for your child. This is especially true when flying with Delta Airlines. Delta requires all passengers, regardless of age, to have proper identification. It’s important to know what type of identification your child needs to fly Delta Airlines and to bring all of the necessary documents with you.

<h2>What is the Age Requirement to Fly Delta?</h2>

Children under the age of 2 are allowed to fly without an ID. All other children must have the proper identification to fly. The minimum age to fly without an accompanying adult is 15 years old. Unaccompanied minors between the ages of 5 and 14 must have a valid passport or other acceptable identification to fly. 

<h2>What Identification is Needed for a Child to Fly Delta?</h2>

The type of identification a child needs to fly Delta depends on the child’s age and the destination. For domestic flights, all children over the age of 18 must have a valid government-issued ID such as a driver’s license, passport, or state ID. For international flights, all children over the age of 18 must have a valid passport. 

For children under the age of 18, the identification requirement is a bit more complicated. Children under the age of 5 must have a valid birth certificate. Children between the ages of 5 and 18 must have a valid government-issued ID such as a driver’s license, state ID, or passport. If a child does not have a valid government-issued ID, Delta will accept a school or medical record as an acceptable form of ID. 

<h2>What are Delta’s Unaccompanied Minor Requirements?</h2>

If your child is between the ages of 5 and 14 and will be flying unaccompanied, there are additional requirements. Unaccompanied minors must have a valid passport or other acceptable identification such as school or medical records. In addition, the minor must be accompanied by an adult who is at least 18 years old and has valid identification. The accompanying adult must remain with the minor until they board their flight and until they have been released to the responsible adult at their destination. 

<h2>What Documents are Needed for Unaccompanied Minors?</h2>

In addition to valid identification, unaccompanied minors must have the following documents with them when they travel:

<ul>
<li>A completed and signed Unaccompanied Minor Form.</li>
<li>Two copies of the minor’s itinerary.</li>
<li>A signed parental consent form.</li>
<li>A copy of the minor’s birth certificate.</li>
</ul>

These documents must be presented at the airport prior to check-in. The accompanying adult must also present valid identification at the airport. 

<h2>Does Delta Provide Special Assistance for Unaccompanied Minors?</h2>
