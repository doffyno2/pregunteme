<p>A 130 degree angle is an acute angle, meaning it is one that measures less than 90 degrees. It is one of the five angles that make up a pentagon, and it is also referred to as an obtuse angle. In geometry, a 130 degree angle can also be referred to as a "flat angle."</p>

<p>An angle of 130 degrees is formed when two straight lines intersect at a single point. This point is known as the "vertex" and the two lines are known as the "arms" of the angle. The arms of a 130 degree angle can be thought of as "opposite sides" of the angle. The angle is also made up of two rays, which are two lines that share the same endpoint and extend out in opposite directions.</p>

<p>The appearance of a 130 degree angle can be described as having a flat edge, with two arms that branch out from the vertex. The arms can be thought of as extending outwards like the hands of a clock, and when they are joined together they create a flat shape that resembles a pentagon.</p>

<p>When two lines intersect and form an angle, it is important to note the direction of the angle. In the case of a 130 degree angle, the angle is said to be clockwise, meaning that the arms of the angle are moving in the same direction as the hands on a clock. This is important to note as it affects the way in which the angle is drawn and measured.</p>

<h2>How to Measure a 130 Degree Angle</h2>

<p>Measuring a 130 degree angle is quite simple. You will need a protractor, which is a tool used for measuring angles. Place the protractor flat on the surface and line up one arm of the angle with the zero mark on the protractor. Then, carefully place the other arm of the angle on the protractor, making sure that it is lined up with the point at which the two arms meet. Then, read the number on the protractor that is at the point where the two arms meet. This number will be the measure of the angle, and in this case it will be 130 degrees.</p>

<h2>Uses of a 130 Degree Angle</h2>

<p>A 130 degree angle can be used in a variety of ways. For example, it is commonly used in the construction of pentagonal shapes, as it forms one of the five sides of the shape. It is also used in the construction of hexagons, as it forms one of the six sides of the shape. Additionally, a 130 degree angle is often used in the construction of various architectural structures, such as bridges and buildings.</p>

<p>The angle can also be used in various types of art, such as drawing and painting. Artists often use angles to create perspective and make their artwork look more realistic. As a result, the 130 degree angle can be used to create certain shapes and forms, such as triangles, circles, and other geometric shapes.</p>

<h3>What is the appearance of a 130 degree angle?</h3>
<p>The appearance of a 130 degree angle can be described as having a flat edge, with two arms that branch out from the vertex. The arms can be thought of as extending outwards like the hands of a clock, and when they are joined together they create a flat shape that resembles a pentagon.</p>

<h3>What is the vertex of a 130 degree angle?</h3>
<p>The vertex of a 130 degree angle is the point at which two straight lines intersect. This is the point from which the two arms of the angle extend outwards, creating the flat shape.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between a 130 degree angle and a 90 degree angle?</h3>
<p>A 130 degree angle is an acute angle, meaning it is one that measures less than 90 degrees. A 90 degree angle, on the other hand, is a right angle, meaning it is one that measures exactly 90 degrees.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between a 130 degree angle and an obtuse angle?</h3>
<p>A 130 degree angle is also referred to as an obtuse angle. An obtuse angle is one that measures more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees. A 130 degree angle is an example of an obtuse angle.</p>

<h3>Are there any other names for a 130 degree angle?</h3>
<p>In geometry, a 130 degree angle can also be referred to as a "flat angle."</p>
