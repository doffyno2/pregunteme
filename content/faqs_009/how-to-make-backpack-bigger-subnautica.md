<h2>What is a Subnautica Backpack?</h2>

The Subnautica backpack is a special type of inventory that allows players to carry more items than they could otherwise. It is available in two sizes, small and large, and is an integral part of Subnautica gameplay. The small backpack provides an additional 30 slots of storage, while the large backpack provides an additional 60 slots of storage. 

<h2>How to Get a Subnautica Backpack:</h2>

The Subnautica backpack can be obtained from the Quarantine Enforcement Platform (QEP) in the Aurora. You will need to complete a quest to gain access to the platform, and then you can purchase the backpack for 500 Prawn suit modules. You can also find the backpack in the Lost River, but you will need to have access to the deep sea base to get it. 

<h2>How to Make Your Subnautica Backpack Bigger</h2>

Making your Subnautica backpack bigger is a great way to increase the amount of items you can carry in the game. There are a few ways to do this, including upgrading your backpack and using a Portable Storage Unit. 

<h3>Upgrade Your Backpack</h3>

The most straightforward way to make your Subnautica backpack bigger is to upgrade it. You can upgrade your backpack to a larger size by using the Fabricator. You will need to collect some items to complete the upgrade, such as Quartz and Lead, and you will also need to purchase a Backpack Upgrade Module from the Quarantine Enforcement Platform. Once you have the necessary items and the upgrade module, you can use the Fabricator to create a backpack upgrade. 

<h3>Use a Portable Storage Unit</h3>

If you don’t have access to a Fabricator, or you don’t want to upgrade your backpack, you can also use a Portable Storage Unit. These units come in various sizes and can be used to store items that you don’t want to carry in your backpack. They can be found scattered around the world, or you can purchase them from the Quarantine Enforcement Platform. 

<h3>Using Your Subnautica Backpack</h3>

Once you have upgraded or obtained a larger Subnautica backpack, it’s important to know how to use it effectively. You should use the backpack to store items that you don’t need to access frequently, such as resources and materials. You should also try to keep a few empty slots free so that you can quickly store items that you find while exploring.
