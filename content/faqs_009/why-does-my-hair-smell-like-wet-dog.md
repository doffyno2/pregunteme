<h2>What Causes Wet Dog Smell in Hair?</h2>

<p>There are several factors that can contribute to the development of wet dog smell in hair. One of the most common causes is an accumulation of bacteria on the scalp. As sweat and sebum accumulate on the scalp, they provide a breeding ground for bacteria, which can cause an unpleasant odor.</p>

Pollution particles such as dust, dirt, and smoke can easily become trapped in the hair follicles, which can also lead to a wet dog smell. Additionally, products that are used on the hair can also contribute to an unpleasant odor. Some products may contain synthetic fragrances or other ingredients that can cause an odor.</p>
