<h2>What Are the Uses of State Initials?</h2>

State initials are used in a variety of contexts. The most common uses are in postal services, newspapers, and maps. 

<h3>Postal Services</h3>

When sending a letter or package through the postal service, you must include the two-letter state initials of the recipient's address. For example, if you are sending a letter to California, you must include the initials of CA on the envelope. Without the correct state initials, the letter or package will not arrive at the correct destination. 

<h3>Newspapers</h3>

State initials are also used in newspapers to identify the state in which an event occurred. For example, a newspaper article about a crime in California will include the initials of CA to indicate the state in which it occurred. 

<h3>Maps</h3>

State initials are often used on maps to identify which state a particular area is located in. For example, a map of the United States will include the initials of each state in the area. This makes it easier to identify which state a particular area is located in.
