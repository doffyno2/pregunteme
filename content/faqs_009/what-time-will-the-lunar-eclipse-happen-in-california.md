<p>A lunar eclipse is an astrophysical phenomenon that occurs when the Moon moves into the shadow of the Earth. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely or partially obscured from the Sun's direct light, and instead, the light is bent and diffused around the Earth, creating a unique and beautiful display. Lunar eclipses occur relatively infrequently, so when one is set to occur, it is an event that many people look forward to.</p>

<p>The next lunar eclipse will occur on May 26, 2021 and will be visible in parts of California. The eclipse will be a partial lunar eclipse, meaning that only part of the Moon will be covered by the Earth's shadow. The eclipse will begin at 12:48 AM Pacific Time and will last for approximately 4 hours and 11 minutes.</p>

<h2>How Can I View The Lunar Eclipse in California?</h2>

<p>To view the lunar eclipse in California, you will need a clear view of the sky with no obstructions such as clouds or buildings. The best place to view the eclipse is in an area that has a high elevation and an unobstructed view of the sky. If you are located in a city, you can try to find a rooftop or balcony that has a clear view of the sky. If you are located in a rural area, you will have a much easier time finding a spot to view the eclipse.</p>

<p>You will also need a pair of binoculars or a telescope to get the best view of the eclipse. Binoculars or a telescope will allow you to see the details of the eclipse, such as the shape of the Earth’s shadow as it covers the moon. If you do not have access to a telescope or binoculars, you can still view the eclipse without them, but they will provide a much better view.</p>

<h2>What Are The Stages of a Lunar Eclipse?</h2>

<p>A lunar eclipse has three stages: partial eclipse, totality and end of eclipse. The partial eclipse is the first stage of the eclipse, when the Moon begins to move into the Earth’s shadow. During this stage, only a portion of the Moon is covered by the Earth’s shadow, and it is the least impressive part of the eclipse. The totality is the second stage of the eclipse, when the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow. This is the most impressive part of the eclipse, as the Moon is totally obscured from the Sun’s light. Finally, the end of the eclipse is when the Moon begins to move out of the Earth’s shadow and the eclipse ends.</p>

<h2>What Time Will The Partial Eclipse Begin in California?</h2>

<p>The partial eclipse will begin at 12:48 AM Pacific Time. This is the moment when the Moon will first enter the Earth’s shadow and the eclipse will begin. The partial eclipse will last for approximately two hours, until 2:48 AM Pacific Time.</p>

<h2>What Time Will The Totality Begin in California?</h2>

<p>The totality will begin at 2:48 AM Pacific Time and will last for approximately one hour and three minutes, until 3:51 AM Pacific Time. This is the most impressive part of the eclipse, as the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow and the night sky is lit up in a unique way.</p>

<h2>What Time Will The Eclipse End in California?</h2>

<p>The eclipse will end at 4:51 AM Pacific Time. At this time, the Moon will begin to move out of the Earth’s shadow and the eclipse will be over. It is important to note that the exact time of the eclipse will vary slightly depending on your exact location in California.</p>
