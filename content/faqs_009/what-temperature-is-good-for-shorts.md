When the weather starts to heat up, shorts are one of the most popular choices in clothing. But what temperature is good for shorts? Is it too hot or too cold to wear shorts?

<h2>What Temperature Is Too Hot for Shorts?</h2>

The temperature at which it is too hot to wear shorts depends on the person. Generally, if the temperature is over 90°F (32°C), it may be too hot for most people to wear shorts. In very hot and humid climates, it may be too hot to wear shorts even at lower temperatures. The humidity can make it feel much hotter than the actual temperature. 

When the temperature is very hot, it is best to wear light and loose fitting clothing to keep cool. Lightweight fabrics such as cotton, linen, and rayon are good choices for hot weather. If you do choose to wear shorts in very hot weather, be sure to wear loose-fitting shorts that allow air to circulate and don’t stick to your skin.

<h2>What Temperature Is Too Cold for Shorts?</h2>

In general, it is too cold to wear shorts when the temperature is below 50°F (10°C). When it is cold outside, it is best to wear warm clothing such as jeans, leggings, or long pants. These will help to keep you warm and protect your legs from the cold. 

It is also important to wear layers when it is cold. Wearing layers of clothing will help to trap your body heat and keep you warm. A good option for cold weather is to wear a light jacket over a long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans or leggings. 

<h2>What Is the Best Temperature for Shorts?</h2>

The best temperature for shorts is generally between 65°F (18°C) and 85°F (29°C). At this temperature, you can stay cool and comfortable while still being able to wear shorts. It is important to remember, however, that everyone is different and what is comfortable for one person may not be comfortable for another. 

If it is too hot or too cold to wear shorts, there are other clothing options that can help you stay cool and comfortable. Lightweight fabrics, such as cotton and linen, are good choices for hot weather. For cooler temperatures, jeans, leggings, and long pants are good options.
