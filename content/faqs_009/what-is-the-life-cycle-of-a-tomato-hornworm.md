<p>The tomato hornworm is a common garden pest that can quickly decimate your tomato plants. It is important to understand the life cycle of the tomato hornworm in order to effectively control it in your garden. This article will explain the life cycle of the tomato hornworm, from egg to adult moth.</p>

<h2>The Egg Stage</h2>

<p>The tomato hornworm begins its life as a tiny egg, laid by a female moth. The eggs are circular, and are typically laid in clusters on the underside of leaves. They are very small, about the size of a pinhead, and pale green in color. They hatch in about 7-14 days, depending on the temperature.</p>

<h2>The Larva Stage</h2>

<p>Once the eggs hatch, the larvae emerge and begin to feed on the leaves and fruit of the tomato plant. The larvae are green in color and have black stripes running down their sides. They can grow up to 3 inches long and have a horn-like projection on their tail end. As the larvae feed, they become larger and more destructive. They will feed for about 3-4 weeks before they enter the pupa stage.</p>

<h2>The Pupa Stage</h2>

<p>Once the larvae reach maturity, they will form a pupa in the soil. The pupa is a hard, brown shell which encases the developing moth. The pupa stage lasts for about 10 days, after which the adult moth will emerge.</p>

<h2>The Adult Moth Stage</h2>

<p>The adult moths are brown in color and have a wingspan of about 2 inches. The female moths lay eggs on the underside of leaves and the cycle begins again. The adult moths will typically live for about 1-2 weeks.</p>

<h2>How to Control Tomato Hornworms</h2>

<p>The best way to control tomato hornworms is to remove them by hand. Look for the telltale signs of their presence, such as stripped leaves or chewed fruit, and inspect the plant carefully to look for the caterpillars. If you find any, simply pick them off and dispose of them. You can also use traps and insecticides to control the population, but these should be used with caution.</p>
