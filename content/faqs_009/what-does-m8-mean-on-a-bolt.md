Bolts are an essential component of many everyday objects and devices. They are used to secure two parts of a structure together and can come in different sizes and shapes depending on the application. But what does "M8" mean when it comes to bolts?

<h2>What Is an M8 Bolt?</h2>

An M8 bolt is a metric fastener with a diameter of 8 millimeters and a thread pitch of 1.25 millimeters. The M8 bolt is commonly used in a variety of applications, from furniture assembly to machinery construction. It is the most common size of bolt used in construction and is easily identifiable by its 8mm diameter.

<h2>What Are the Different Types of M8 Bolts?</h2>

There are a variety of different types of M8 bolts available, all designed for specific purposes. The most common types are: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Carriage Bolts</b> – These bolts feature a smooth, cylindrical head and a square neck that locks the bolt into place. Carriage bolts are typically used to secure wood and metal together.</li>
  <li><b>Hex Bolts</b> – Hex bolts have a hexagonal head and a threaded shank. They are commonly used in machinery and other applications where a secure, durable connection is needed.</li>
  <li><b>Socket Head Cap Screws</b> – Socket head cap screws are fasteners with a countersunk head and an external hex socket. They are commonly used in applications where a secure, tight fit is required.</li>
  <li><b>Flange Bolts</b> – Flange bolts have a wide, flat head and are commonly used to secure two pieces of metal together. The head of the bolt provides a strong, durable connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Strong Is an M8 Bolt?</h2>

The strength of an M8 bolt depends on the material it is made out of. Generally, an M8 bolt made of steel will have a tensile strength of around 880 MPa, while an M8 bolt made of stainless steel will have a tensile strength of around 1000 MPa.

<h2>What Is the Difference Between M8 and M10 Bolts?</h2>

The main difference between M8 and M10 bolts is their size. An M8 bolt has a diameter of 8mm and a thread pitch of 1.25mm, while an M10 bolt has a diameter of 10mm and a thread pitch of 1.5mm. As a result, an M10 bolt is larger than an M8 bolt and can handle more load.

<h2>How Do You Measure an M8 Bolt?</h2>

Measuring an M8 bolt is fairly straightforward. To do so, you'll need to measure the diameter of the bolt with a ruler or caliper. An M8 bolt should measure 8mm in diameter. You can also measure the thread pitch with a thread pitch gauge. An M8 bolt should have a thread pitch of 1.25mm.

<h2>What Are the Common Uses for M8 Bolts?</h2>

M8 bolts are commonly used in a variety of applications, from securing furniture together to constructing machinery. They are also commonly used in car engines, as well as in the construction of boats and other marine vessels.

<h3>Are M8 Bolts Reusable?</h3>

Yes, depending on the application and the material of the bolt, M8 bolts can be reused. Always inspect the bolt for wear and tear before reusing it. If the bolt is worn or damaged, it should be replaced.

<h3>Are M8 Bolts Universal?</h3>

No, M8 bolts are not universal. Different types of bolts are designed for specific applications, so it is important to choose the right type of bolt for the job.

<h3>Can You Use an M8 Bolt in Place of an M10 Bolt?</h3>

No, an M8 bolt is not strong enough to replace an M10 bolt. An M8 bolt has a diameter of 8mm and a thread pitch of 1.25mm, while an M10 bolt has a diameter of 10mm and a thread pitch of 1.5mm. As a result, an M10 bolt is larger than an M8 bolt and can handle more load. 

<h3>Can You Use an M10 Bolt in Place of an M8 Bolt?</h3>

Yes, you can use an M10 bolt in place of an M8 bolt. However, you should always make sure that the bolt is the correct size and type for the application. Additionally, it is important to note that an M10 bolt is larger than an M8 bolt and can handle more load.
