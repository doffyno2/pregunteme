<p>In the world of Witcher 3, silver swords are a must-have for any aspiring witcher. Silver swords are the weapon of choice for witchers as they are able to cut through monsters and beasts of all kinds with ease. However, these swords are delicate and require regular maintenance and repair in order to maintain their strength and sharpness. In this article, we will cover the necessary steps and materials required to repair any silver sword in Witcher 3.</p>

<h2>Required Materials </h2>

<p>In order to repair a silver sword in Witcher 3, you will need a few basic materials. First, you will need blacksmithing tools such as a forge, an anvil, a hammer, and tongs. In addition, you will need silver ingots, which can be purchased from merchants or acquired by mining ore. Lastly, you will need leather, which can also be acquired from merchants or by tanning animal hides. </p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Forge </h2>

<p>Before you can begin repairing your silver sword, you will need to prepare the forge. Start by collecting a bundle of charcoal and placing it in the bottom of the forge. Then, light the charcoal using a flint and steel or other fire source. Once the charcoal is burning, you can begin adding the silver ingots to the forge. As the silver begins to melt, use the tongs to stir and mix the molten silver until it forms a uniform texture.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Form the Blade </h2>

<p>Once the silver is melted, you can begin forming the blade of the sword. Take your anvil and place it on a flat surface. Then, use tongs to take a small amount of the molten silver and place it on the anvil. Using the hammer, begin forming the metal into a long, thin blade. Take your time to ensure that the blade is even and consistent in thickness and width. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Attach the Hilt </h2>

<p>Once the blade is formed, you can begin attaching the hilt. Take a piece of leather and cut it into a long strip that is slightly wider than the blade of the sword. Wrap the leather tightly around the hilt and secure it with a few nails or rivets. Once the hilt is attached, you can place the blade in the forge once more and heat it until it is glowing red. Once the blade is heated, use the hammer to temper it and increase its strength.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Finish the Sword </h2>

<p>Now that the blade and hilt are both attached, you can finish up the sword. Begin by polishing the blade with a whetstone until it is smooth and shiny. Then, use a file to sharpen the blade and give it an even sharper edge. Finally, you can use a cloth to buff the blade and hilt until it shines like new. </p>
