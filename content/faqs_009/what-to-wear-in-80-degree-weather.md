Summertime is here, and that means the temperatures are rising. For many of us, this means we’re headed outdoors to enjoy the beautiful weather. But when the thermometer reads 80 degrees, it can be hard to know what to wear. After all, you want to stay cool, but you don’t want to be uncomfortable. So, what should you wear in 80 degree weather?

<h2>Lightweight Fabrics</h2>

The best fabrics to wear in hot weather are lightweight and breathable. Cotton is always a good choice, as it’s lightweight and naturally breathable. Linen is also a great option, as it’s lightweight and airy. You could also try a lightweight synthetic fabric, such as polyester or rayon, which are both lightweight and breathable.

<h2>Shorts or Skirts</h2>

When the temperature climbs, shorts and skirts are your best bet. Shorts come in a variety of styles, from cut-off denim shorts to more tailored options. Skirts are a great way to stay cool while still looking fashionable. Choose a lightweight cotton or linen skirt in a solid color or a fun print.

<h2>Lightweight Tops</h2>

In 80 degree weather, you want to choose lightweight tops. Try a sleeveless blouse or tank top in a lightweight fabric. For a more casual look, try a T-shirt in a lightweight fabric. If you’re looking for something more dressy, opt for a lightweight linen or cotton blouse.

When the temperature climbs, accessories become even more important. A wide-brimmed hat will help keep the sun off your face and neck. A lightweight scarf or bandanna can also be used to help keep you cool. Sunglasses are essential for keeping the sun out of your eyes. And don’t forget sunscreen!

<h2>Footwear</h2>

When it comes to footwear, sandals are your best bet. Sandals come in a variety of styles, from flip-flops to strappy sandals. Choose a pair that’s comfortable and won’t rub or chafe your feet. If you’re looking for something more dressy, try a pair of leather sandals.
