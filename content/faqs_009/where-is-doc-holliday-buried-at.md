The American dentist-turned-gunslinger John Henry "Doc" Holliday is a legendary figure in the American Old West. Born in 1851, Holliday is remembered for his friendship with lawman Wyatt Earp and for his involvement in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. Although he died in 1887 at the age of 36, he remains an iconic figure in American Western folklore. But where is Doc Holliday buried?

<h2>Doc Holliday's Life and Death</h2>

John Henry Holliday was born in Griffin, Georgia, a small town located roughly 40 miles southwest of Atlanta. From an early age, he showed a promise in academics, graduating from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery in 1872. He then moved to Dallas, Texas to practice dentistry and quickly gained a reputation as a skilled professional. But his life changed dramatically when he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1873, forcing him to leave his dental practice and move to the drier climate of the American Southwest.

Holliday spent much of his life in the West, first in Texas, then moving to Arizona and eventually to Colorado. He became involved in gambling, saloons and other underworld activities in the towns he visited. He also became close friends with Wyatt Earp and other famous lawmen of the era. In October 1881, Holliday and Earp faced off against the Clanton Gang in the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona.

Holliday continued to suffer from tuberculosis, however, and his health steadily declined. In 1887, he was moved to Glenwood Springs, Colorado, in an attempt to find relief from his illness. On November 8, 1887, at the age of 36, Doc Holliday died from complications of tuberculosis.
