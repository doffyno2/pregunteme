<p>Zebras are some of the most iconic and recognizable animals in the world. With their distinctive black and white stripes, zebras stand out from the crowd and have become a symbol of the African savannah. But what color is a zebra really?</p>

<p>The answer is both simple and complicated. Zebras are not just one color. In fact, the unique pattern of stripes found on zebras is made up of several different colors. While it is generally accepted that zebras are black and white, the truth is that the colors of a zebra can range from brown to yellow to even red. The pattern of stripes is also unique to each zebra, which means that no two zebras have the same exact pattern.</p>

<p>The most common colors associated with zebras are black and white, but some zebras have other colors, such as brown and yellow, in their stripes. The brown and yellow stripes are most often found on the face and legs of the animal. This is because the black and white stripes are thought to help the zebra blend in with its surroundings and act as camouflage. The brown and yellow stripes, on the other hand, can help the zebra stand out and make it easier for other animals to spot it.</p>

<p>The unique mix of colors found in the stripes of a zebra is actually created by the animal’s fur. The black and white stripes are created by the two different types of hair found on the zebra’s body. The black hair is made up of black pigment and the white hair is made up of yellowish-white pigment. This combination of different colored hair is what gives the zebra its unique pattern of stripes.</p>
