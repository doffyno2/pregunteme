<p>Crossing Jordan was a popular crime drama series that aired on NBC from 2001 to 2007. It was created by Tim Kring and starred Jill Hennessy as Jordan Cavanaugh, a medical examiner who solved crimes with her team. Despite its popularity, the show was cancelled after its sixth season, leaving fans to wonder, why did Crossing Jordan end?</p>

<h2>The Ratings Decline of Crossing Jordan</h2>

<p>The first season of Crossing Jordan was a success, with ratings that ranked within the top 20 of the season. The show was a critical success as well, and was even nominated for two Emmy Awards. However, the show’s ratings began to decline in subsequent seasons. By the end of its fifth season, the show was no longer in the top 40, and its sixth season saw a further decline in ratings.</p>

<h2>Creative Differences</h2>

<p>Creative differences between the show’s writers and producers may have also contributed to the show’s cancellation. At the end of the show’s fifth season, Kring was replaced as the show runner by Jan Nash. Nash attempted to bring a more “serialized” approach to the show, but many of the show’s writers felt that it strayed too far from the show’s original concept. This led to a number of writers leaving the show, including Kring.</p>

<h2>The Cost of Production</h2>

<p>The cost of production may also have been a factor in the show’s cancellation. The show was filmed on location in Los Angeles, and filming on location is expensive. In addition, the show featured a large cast and a number of special guest stars, which added to the cost of production. NBC may have decided to cancel the show in order to save money.</p>

<h2>The Show's Legacy</h2>

<p>Despite its cancellation, Crossing Jordan remains a popular show with fans. The show’s main characters, Jordan Cavanaugh, Woody Hoyt, and Nigel Townsend, were popular with fans. The show also featured a number of guest stars, including Ben Stiller, Eric Stoltz, and Eliza Dushku. Despite its cancellation, Crossing Jordan remains a beloved show and its legacy lives on.</p>
