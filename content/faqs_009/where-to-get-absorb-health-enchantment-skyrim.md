Skyrim is one of the most popular video games of all time and for good reason. The game offers a wide range of unique and exciting features, including enchantments that can be used to imbue weapons and armor with powerful effects. One of the more powerful enchantments available in the game is the Absorb Health enchantment, which allows the wearer of the enchanted item to absorb the health of their enemies.
