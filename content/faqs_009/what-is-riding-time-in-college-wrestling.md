<h2>What is College Wrestling?</h2>

College wrestling is an organized competitive sport involving two wrestlers competing against one another on a mat. It is one of the oldest competitive sports in the world and is one of the few sports that is still contested on a college level. College wrestling has a long and storied history, with the first collegiate wrestling match taking place in 1883. The sport has been included in the NCAA championships since 1928, and it is one of the most popular college sports in the United States.

<h2>What is Riding Time?</h2>

Riding time is a scoring system used in college wrestling matches. The system awards points for a wrestler who is able to maintain control of his opponent for an extended period of time. This system is designed to reward technical skill and endurance, as well as to provide an advantage to wrestlers who are able to maintain superior positions on the mat.

Under the riding time rule, a wrestler who is able to maintain control of his opponent for at least one minute is awarded one point. This point is awarded regardless of whether the wrestler is able to score a takedown or other offensive maneuvers. The system is designed to reward wrestlers who are able to control the match without necessarily scoring the most points.

<h2>How is Riding Time Scored?</h2>

In college wrestling, riding time is scored in two ways. The first way is by the number of seconds that a wrestler is able to maintain control of his opponent. If a wrestler is able to maintain control of his opponent for one minute or more, he is awarded one point. The second way is by the number of points that a wrestler is able to score while in control of his opponent. If a wrestler is able to score two or more points while in control of his opponent, he is awarded one additional point.

<h2>What is the Purpose of Riding Time?</h2>

The purpose of riding time is to reward technical skill, endurance, and superior positioning on the mat. It is designed to encourage wrestlers to use their technical skill and endurance rather than relying solely on brute force and strength. This system also rewards wrestlers who are able to control the match without necessarily scoring the most points.

<h2>What is the Difference Between Riding Time and Nearfall Points?</h2>

Riding time and nearfall points are both used to score college wrestling matches. Riding time is awarded when a wrestler is able to maintain control of his opponent for an extended period of time, while nearfall points are awarded when a wrestler is able to score points while in control of his opponent. Both systems are designed to reward technical skill, endurance, and superior positioning on the mat.

<h2>How Does Riding Time Impact a Match?</h2>

Riding time can have a significant impact on the outcome of a college wrestling match. If a wrestler is able to maintain control of his opponent for an extended period of time, he is awarded one point. This point can often be the difference between a win or a loss in a close match. Additionally, if a wrestler is able to score points while in control of his opponent, he is awarded an additional point. This system rewards wrestlers who are able to maintain superior positions on the mat and encourages them to use their technical skill and endurance rather than relying solely on brute force and strength.
