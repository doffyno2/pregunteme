<p>Whether you’re a novice driver or an experienced one, it’s important to know which gear you should use for different speeds. The wrong gear can cause your vehicle to be less efficient and you may end up wasting fuel and time. Knowing which gear to use for different speeds can also help you stay safe on the road. Here’s what you need to know.</p>

<h2>How to Change Gears?</h2>

<p>Changing gears is relatively simple, but it’s important to do it correctly. When you’re ready to change gears, press the clutch pedal down and release the accelerator. Then, move the gear lever into the desired gear. When you’ve done this, lift your foot off the clutch and re-engage the accelerator.</p>

<h2>Which Gear for What Speed Kmh?</h2>

<p>The gear you use will depend on the speed of your vehicle. If you’re travelling at a slow speed, you’ll need to use a lower gear. Conversely, if you’re travelling at higher speeds, you’ll need to use a higher gear. Generally, when driving a manual vehicle, the rule of thumb is to use the following gears for the following speeds:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First Gear:</strong> Up to 10 kmh</li>
  <li><strong>Second Gear:</strong> 10 - 20 kmh</li>
  <li><strong>Third Gear:</strong> 20 - 30 kmh</li>
  <li><strong>Fourth Gear:</strong> 30 - 45 kmh</li>
  <li><strong>Fifth Gear:</strong> 45 - 65 kmh</li>
  <li><strong>Sixth Gear:</strong> 65 kmh and above</li>
