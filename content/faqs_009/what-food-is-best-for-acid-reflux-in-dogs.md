Acid reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux, is a common condition in dogs in which their stomach contents come back up into their esophagus. This can cause pain and discomfort for your pet, and can lead to more serious health problems if not treated properly. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to help ease your dog’s acid reflux symptoms, including making sure they are eating the right foods. 

<h2>What Causes Acid Reflux in Dogs?</h2>

Acid reflux occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a one-way valve at the junction of the esophagus and stomach, does not function properly. This can happen due to a variety of factors, including obesity, eating too quickly, drinking too much water, eating too much fatty food, or eating certain types of food such as chocolate, onions, or tomatoes. 

<h2>What are the Symptoms of Acid Reflux in Dogs?</h2>

The most common signs of acid reflux in dogs are regurgitating food, vomiting, coughing, excessive drooling, and difficulty swallowing. Your dog may also show signs of discomfort or pain. If not treated properly, acid reflux can lead to more serious health problems such as esophagitis or ulcers. 

<h2>What Food is Best for Dogs With Acid Reflux?</h2>

The best food for a dog with acid reflux is one that is low in fat and high in protein. This will help to reduce the amount of acid that is produced in the stomach, as well as provide your pet with the nutrition they need to stay healthy. Some good food choices for a dog with acid reflux include:

<h3>Meats</h3>

Skinless, boneless chicken, turkey, or lean beef are all good choices for dogs with acid reflux. Make sure to cook the meat thoroughly to avoid the risk of food-borne illness. 

<h3>Fish</h3>

Fish such as salmon, tuna, or mackerel are high in protein and low in fat. They are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation and aid in digestion. 

<h3>Grains</h3>

Grains such as oats, brown rice, or barley can help to fill your dog up without causing too much acid production. You can also try cooked sweet potatoes or cooked pumpkin, both of which are high in fiber and low in fat. 

<h3>Fruits and Vegetables</h3>

Fruits and vegetables such as apples, carrots, or broccoli are a great source of fiber and can help to fill your dog up. Be sure to cook them thoroughly before serving them to your pet. 

<h2>Tips for Feeding Your Dog With Acid Reflux</h2>

In addition to choosing the right food, there are a few other tips you can follow to help ease your dog’s acid reflux symptoms:

<h3>Feed Smaller Meals</h3>

Feeding your dog smaller, more frequent meals can help to reduce the amount of acid their stomach produces. This will help to ease their symptoms and help them to feel better. 

<h3>Avoid Table Scraps</h3>

Table scraps are often high in fat and can trigger acid reflux symptoms. It is best to avoid giving your dog any table food and stick to their regular diet. 

<h3>Limit Treats</h3>

Treats are often high in fat and can trigger acid reflux symptoms. Limit the amount of treats you give your dog and opt for healthier options such as fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables. 

<h3>Don't Exercise Immediately After Eating</h3>

Exercising immediately after eating can cause your dog's stomach contents to come back up into their esophagus. Give your dog at least an hour after eating before allowing them to exercise.
