<p>It is common to experience pain in the ribs when you sneeze. This pain is usually due to the sudden increase in air pressure in the chest cavity that occurs during a sneeze. When the pressure increases, it can cause the ribs to press against each other and cause pain. The sensation can be intense, and it can cause sharp, shooting pains that can last for a few seconds to a few minutes.</p>

<p>In some cases, the pain may be due to a medical condition, such as costochondritis. Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone. This condition can cause pain in your chest, especially when you take a deep breath, laugh, or sneeze. It is usually caused by an infection or injury and can be treated with medications or physical therapy.</p>

<p>In other cases, the pain can be caused by a muscle strain or sprain. When sneezing, the chest muscles can become strained and cause pain in the ribs. This type of pain can be relieved with rest and over-the-counter pain medications.</p>

<p>In some cases, the pain may be due to a more serious underlying medical condition, such as a rib fracture or a herniated disc in the spine. If the pain is severe or lasts for more than a few days, it is important to seek medical attention to determine the cause of the pain.</p>
