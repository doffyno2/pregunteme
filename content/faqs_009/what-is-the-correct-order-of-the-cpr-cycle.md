<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving technique used in medical emergencies to restore blood circulation and breathing in a person whose heart has stopped beating or is close to stopping. It is important to learn the correct order of the CPR cycle so that the procedure can be performed correctly and effectively. This article will explain the correct order of the CPR cycle and how it is used in medical emergencies.</p>

<h2>What Is The CPR Cycle?</h2>

<p>The CPR cycle is composed of three steps: compressions, followed by rescue breaths, and then compressions again. The cycle is repeated continuously until help arrives or the person regains consciousness and breathing. The cycle is designed to keep oxygen-rich blood circulating throughout the body and prevent brain damage from lack of oxygen. Here is an overview of the CPR cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compressions: Chest compressions are performed to keep oxygen-rich blood circulating throughout the body and to keep the heart pumping.</li>
  <li>Rescue breaths: Rescue breaths are performed to help restore breathing. A mask or barrier device is used to help protect the rescuer from contact with the victim’s saliva and other bodily fluids.</li>
  <li>Compressions again: Compressions are performed again to keep oxygen-rich blood circulating throughout the body.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Correct Order Of The CPR Cycle</h2>

<p>The correct order of the CPR cycle is compressions, followed by rescue breaths, and then compressions again. This cycle should be repeated continuously until help arrives or the person regains consciousness and breathing. It is important to remember that the compressions should be performed at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute and each compression should be about two inches deep.</p>

<h2>How To Perform CPR</h2>

<p>The steps for performing CPR on an adult are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure the scene is safe and the person is unresponsive.</li>
  <li>Call 911 or your local emergency number.</li>
  <li>Start chest compressions: Place the heel of one hand in the center of the person’s chest and place the other hand on top of it with the fingers interlocked. Push hard and fast at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.</li>
  <li>Give two rescue breaths: After 30 compressions, tilt the person’s head back and lift their chin up. Pinch the person’s nose shut and give two slow breaths. Each breath should last about one second.</li>
  <li>Continue chest compressions: Give 30 more chest compressions and repeat the cycle of compressions and rescue breaths until help arrives.</li>
</ul>
