<p>A common question many 18-year-olds may have is “What year was I born if I’m 18?” The answer to this question can be found by looking at a person’s birth certificate or by simply doing the math. In this article, we will explain how to determine the year in which you were born if you are currently 18 years old.</p>

<h2>Understanding Age</h2>

<p>In order to answer the question “What year was I born if I’m 18?” it’s important to first understand the concept of age. In the Western world, age is generally calculated in years and begins at birth. In other words, when a person is born, they are considered to be one year old. Every subsequent year, a person’s age increases by one. So, when a person turns 18, they are considered to be 18 years old.</p>

<h2>Determining Your Year of Birth</h2>

<p>Once you understand the concept of age, determining the year in which you were born is relatively easy. All you need to do is subtract 18 from the current year. For example, if it is 2021, you were born in 2003. If it is 2022, you were born in 2004. This simple calculation makes it easy to answer the question “What year was I born if I’m 18?”</p>

<h2>Knowing Your Exact Date of Birth</h2>

This document will list your exact date of birth, as well as other important information such as your place of birth and parents’ names. Knowing your exact date of birth can be useful if you need to provide proof of age or if you want to celebrate your birthday on the correct day.</p>
