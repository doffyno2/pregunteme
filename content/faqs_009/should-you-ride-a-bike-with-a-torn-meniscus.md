Riding a bicycle is a great way to stay fit, enjoy the outdoors, and get around town. Unfortunately, if you have a torn meniscus, it can be difficult to decide if it’s safe to ride a bike.

The meniscus is a thin piece of cartilage that helps absorb shock and lubricate the knee joint. A torn meniscus can be painful and can make it difficult to move your knee. The symptoms of a torn meniscus include pain, swelling, stiffness, and a clicking or popping sensation when you move your leg.

In this article, we’ll discuss why it’s important to consider the risks of riding a bike with a torn meniscus and offer some tips for riding safely.

<h2>What Causes a Torn Meniscus?</h2>

A torn meniscus is usually caused by a sudden twisting movement of the knee. This can happen while playing sports or during everyday activities. It can also be caused by a direct blow to the knee, such as when you fall off a bike.
