How to Make a Copper Coil Hot Water Heater for Camping

Camping trips are a great way to get away from it all and enjoy some quality time with family and friends. But one of the main drawbacks of camping is that it can be difficult to keep warm and comfortable, especially when the nights are cold. One way you can stay warm and cozy is by making a hot water heater, and one of the best materials to use for this is copper. Copper is an excellent conductor of heat, making it the ideal material for a camping hot water heater. In this article, we will look at how to make a copper coil hot water heater for camping, including what materials you need and the step-by-step instructions.

In order to make a copper coil hot water heater for camping, you will need the following materials:
<ul>
<li>Copper coil tubing</li>
<li>Screws</li>
<li>Screwdriver</li>
<li>Drill with a bit</li>
<li>Soldering iron</li>
<li>Lead-free solder</li>
<li>Fitting</li>
<li>Gasket</li>
<li>Heat shield</li>
<li>Heat source (such as a campfire or an electric hot plate)</li>
</ul>


Now that you have gathered the necessary materials, it is time to begin constructing your copper coil hot water heater. Follow these steps to get the job done:
<h2>Step 1: Measure the Copper Coil</h2>
The first step is to measure the length of the copper coil. It should be long enough to fit around the circumference of the container you will be using to hold the hot water. 
<h2>Step 2: Cut the Copper Coil</h2>
Once you have measured the copper coil, use a hacksaw to cut it to the desired length. Make sure that the ends of the copper coil are flush and even. 
<h2>Step 3: Attach the Fitting</h2>
Attach the fitting to the end of the copper coil. Make sure that the fitting is secure and that the threads are lined up correctly. 
<h2>Step 4: Add the Gasket</h2>
Place the gasket on the fitting and then tighten the fitting with the screws. Make sure that the gasket is properly seated and that the fitting is securely tightened. 
<h2>Step 5: Attach the Heat Shield</h2>
Attach the heat shield to the fitting. Make sure that the heat shield is secure and that it covers the entire fitting. 
<h2>Step 6: Solder the Joints</h2>
Use a soldering iron and lead-free solder to join the copper coil at the joints. Make sure that all of the joints are securely soldered and that there are no gaps or open joints. 
<h2>Step 7: Drill Holes</h2>
Use a drill and bit to drill small holes in the heat shield. This will allow the heated air to escape and circulate around the container. 
<h2>Step 8: Place the Copper Coil around the Container</h2>
Once all of the steps are complete, you can place the copper coil around the container. Make sure that the copper coil is securely in place and that the heat shield is facing outward. 
<h2>Step 9: Heat the Water</h2>
Finally, you can use your heat source to heat the water. Make sure to keep a safe distance from the heat source and to monitor the temperature of the water. 


Making a copper coil hot water heater for camping is an easy and affordable way to stay warm and comfortable on those chilly nights. All you need is some copper coil tubing, a few other materials and tools, and some basic knowledge of soldering. With these simple steps, you can have a hot water heater ready to use in no time.
