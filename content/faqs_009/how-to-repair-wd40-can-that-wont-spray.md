<p>WD-40 is one of the most widely used and versatile lubricants on the market. It's used for everything from loosening rusted and stuck parts to protecting metal surfaces from corrosion. It's also used to clean and protect tools, guns, and other items. But, if your WD-40 can won't spray, it can be a real headache.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are a few easy steps you can take to try to get your WD-40 can back in working order. In this guide, we'll cover how to repair a WD-40 can that won't spray, as well as some tips and tricks to help keep it working properly.</p>

<h2>Steps to Take When a WD-40 Can Won't Spray</h2>

<p>If your WD-40 can isn't spraying, the first thing you should do is check the nozzle. If there's any debris clogging it, it won't be able to spray. To clear it, simply unscrew the nozzle and use a pin or needle to clear away any blockage.</p>

<p>If the nozzle is clear, the next step is to check the propellant. If the propellant has evaporated, the can won't be able to spray. To check if this is the case, hold the can upside down and press the trigger. If it doesn't spray, then the propellant has likely evaporated and you'll need to purchase a new can of WD-40.</p>

<p>If the propellant is still present, the next step is to check the pressure valve. This is a small, round valve located near the top of the can. To check it, simply unscrew the valve and press the trigger. If it still doesn't spray, then the pressure valve is likely clogged or damaged and you'll need to replace it.</p>

<p>If the pressure valve is in working order, then the last step is to check the release valve. This is a small, round valve located near the bottom of the can. To check it, unscrew the valve and press the trigger. If the can still doesn't spray, then the release valve is likely clogged or damaged and you'll need to replace it.</p>

<h2>Preventative Measures to Keep a WD-40 Can Working</h2>

<p>In addition to repairing a WD-40 can that won't spray, there are also some preventative measures you can take to help keep it functioning properly. The first is to always store the can in a cool, dry place. If it's exposed to too much heat or moisture, it can cause the propellant to evaporate and make the can unusable.</p>

<p>Another important preventative measure is to always shake the can thoroughly before using it. This will help keep the propellant and other components mixed together and make sure they're properly functioning.</p>

<p>Finally, it's important to regularly check the nozzle and pressure/release valves to make sure they're free of any debris or clogs. If they become clogged, they won't be able to properly release the WD-40 and it won't be able to spray.</p>
