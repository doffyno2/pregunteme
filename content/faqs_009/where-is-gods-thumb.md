<p>The question of where God's thumb is located has been around for centuries, but there is no definitive answer. Most people generally agree that God is omnipresent and that He is everywhere, but that still leaves the question of where is His thumb? Is it in heaven, or is it somewhere on Earth?</p>

<p>The Bible does not specifically mention anything about God's thumb, so it is difficult to get an exact answer. However, there are some common beliefs about where God's thumb is located. Some believe that God's thumb is located in heaven, while others believe that it is located somewhere on Earth. The debate continues to this day, and the answer may never be known.</p>

<p>One of the most popular theories about God's thumb is that it is located in heaven. This theory is based on the idea that God is omnipresent and all-knowing, which means that He is everywhere at once. This would include heaven, where God's throne is located. This would make sense, since God is all-powerful and would be able to move His thumb anywhere He wanted.</p>

<p>Another popular theory is that God's thumb is located somewhere on Earth. This theory is based on the idea that God created the universe and everything in it, including the Earth.

<p>The third theory is that God's thumb is located in both heaven and Earth. This theory is based on the idea that God is omnipresent and all-knowing, which means that He is everywhere at once. This would include both heaven and Earth, where God's throne and His thumb would be located. This would make sense, since God is all-powerful and would be able to move His thumb anywhere He wanted.</p>

<p>No matter where God's thumb is located, it is clear that He is all-powerful and all-knowing. He is the creator of the universe and everything in it, including the Earth and its inhabitants. He is also omnipresent, which means that He is everywhere at once. This means that He is able to move His thumb anywhere He wants, regardless of where it is located.</p>
