<p>Shining Force is a turn-based strategy game series developed by Sega for the Sega Genesis and Game Gear. The original Shining Force was released in 1992 and spawned several sequels on a variety of platforms. The series has been praised for its challenging and strategic gameplay, deep narrative, and rich characters. Players take on the role of a member of the Shining Force, a group of warriors tasked with defending the world from various supernatural forces.</p>

<p>In the game, players can choose to promote their characters to higher levels, increasing their stats and unlocking new abilities. But when is the best time to promote your characters? There are a few factors to consider when deciding when to promote a character.</p>

<h2>Consider Your Character's Stats</h2>

<p>Before promoting a character, it's important to consider their current stats. Different characters are better suited to different roles, and it's important to make sure your character has the stats necessary to fill that role. If a character has high attack but low defense, they may be better suited to a damage-dealing role than a tanking role. Conversely, a character with low attack and high defense may excel in a tanking role.</p>

<p>It's also important to consider how much your character can benefit from promotion. Characters with low stats may not benefit as much from promotion, making it less desirable to promote them. Conversely, characters with high stats may benefit greatly from promotion, making promotion more desirable.</p>

<h2>Consider Your Character's Abilities</h2>

<p>In addition to considering your character's stats, it's also important to consider their abilities. Some characters have powerful abilities that can be unlocked through promotion. For example, the Swordsman class in Shining Force II has the ability to counterattack, which is unlocked at level 7. If you have a Swordsman with high stats, promoting them to level 7 may be beneficial.</p>

<p>It's also important to consider how powerful the character's abilities are. If a character has an ability that is extremely powerful, promoting them to unlock it may be beneficial. On the other hand, if a character has an ability that is not very powerful, promoting them may not be worth the cost.</p>

<h2>Consider Your Character's Role</h2>

<p>Finally, it's important to consider your character's role in the game. Different characters are better suited to different roles, and it's important to make sure your character is in the role they are best suited for. For example, a character with high attack and low defense may be better suited to a damage-dealing role than a tanking role.</p>

<p>It's also important to consider how important the character's role is. If your character is in a critical role, such as a tank, it may be beneficial to promote them to increase their stats and make them more effective. On the other hand, if your character is in a less important role, such as a healer, promoting them may not be as beneficial.</p>
