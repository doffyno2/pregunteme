The United States is home to some of the most majestic and challenging peak elevations in the world. With its diverse geography, the continental United States offers a wealth of opportunities for both novice and experienced climbers. The highest peak in the continental United States is Mount Whitney, located in California’s Sierra Nevada range.

<h2>The History of Mount Whitney</h2>

Mount Whitney was first surveyed in 1864 by Clarence King and is named after Josiah Whitney, a professor of geology at Harvard University. In 1873, the California State Geological Survey determined the peak to be the highest point in the continental United States. The peak is part of the Inyo National Forest, and it is located in the Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Death Valley National Park.

There are two primary routes for climbers to take when attempting to summit Mount Whitney, the Mount Whitney Trail and the Mountaineer's Route. The Mount Whitney Trail is the most popular route and is the easiest to climb. It is a well-maintained trail with switchbacks and gradual inclines that lead to the summit.
