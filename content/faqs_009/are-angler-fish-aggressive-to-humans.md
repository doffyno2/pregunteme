Anglerfish can be aggressive, but the degree of aggression varies depending on the species, size of the fish, and habitat. In general, small anglerfish are not aggressive and will not attack humans unless provoked.

If you encounter an aggressive anglerfish, it is important to stay calm and move away slowly. Do not make sudden movements or come too close to the fish. It is also important to avoid making loud noises, as this can further agitate the fish.

If the anglerfish persists in attacking, you should back away slowly and seek help from a professional who is experienced in dealing with aggressive fish.



Anglerfish can bite humans, but the severity of the bite depends on the size of the fish and the size of its teeth. Smaller anglerfish are unlikely to cause any significant damage, but larger anglerfish can cause deep cuts and scrapes if they bite.
