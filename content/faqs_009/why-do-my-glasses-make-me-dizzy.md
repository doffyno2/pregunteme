<p>Having issues with dizziness can be a very disconcerting experience. If you wear glasses, this can be even more concerning, as you may wonder if it is the glasses themselves that are causing your dizziness. Fortunately, there are a few potential reasons why your glasses may be causing you to feel dizzy. In this article, we will discuss the most common causes of dizziness associated with glasses and how to remedy them.</p>

<h2>How Do Glasses Make You Dizzy?</h2>

<p>There are a few potential ways that glasses can make you feel dizzy. One of the most common is an incorrect prescription. If you are wearing glasses with the wrong prescription, this can cause problems with your vision and balance, leading to dizziness. Additionally, if the frames are too heavy or the lenses too thick, this can also contribute to feelings of dizziness.</p>

<p>Another potential cause of dizziness related to glasses is eyestrain. If you are wearing glasses that are not the right prescription, this can put extra strain on your eyes, leading to a feeling of dizziness. Additionally, if you are wearing the wrong frames, they may not be supporting your eyes correctly, leading to eyestrain and dizziness.</p>

<p>Finally, if you find that your dizziness is worse when you are wearing your glasses than when you are not wearing them, this can be another sign that your glasses are the cause of your dizziness.
