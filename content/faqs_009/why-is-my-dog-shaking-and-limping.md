<p>If your dog is shaking and limping, it could be a sign that something is wrong. It’s important to take your dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible to get a diagnosis and treatment.

In this article, we’ll discuss the possible causes of these symptoms in dogs and how to best help your pet.</p>

<h2>What Causes Shaking and Limping in Dogs?</h2>

<p>Shaking and limping in dogs can be caused by a variety of issues, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Injury or trauma</b>: If your dog has been in an accident, or has been playing roughly, they may be shaking and limping due to an injury.

Your veterinarian can help determine the cause of the pain and provide appropriate treatment.</li>
  <li><b>Anxiety</b>: If your dog is anxious, they may be shaking and limping due to the stress.
