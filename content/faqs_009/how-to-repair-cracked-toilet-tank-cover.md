<p>A cracked toilet tank cover can be a major inconvenience, not to mention a safety hazard. If the crack is severe enough, the entire tank may need to be replaced. But, if the crack is minor, there are some simple steps you can take to repair it yourself. In this article, we’ll teach you how to repair a cracked toilet tank cover, so you can get your toilet back up and running in no time.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<p>Before you get started, you’ll need to gather some supplies. You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new tank cover</li>
  <li>Masking tape</li>
  <li>A putty knife</li>
  <li>Spackling paste</li>
  <li>Sandpaper</li>
  <li>A damp cloth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Surface</h2>

<p>The first step is to prepare the surface for repair. Start by peeling off any old masking tape or stickers on the surface of the tank cover. Use the putty knife to scrape off any remaining adhesive. Once the surface is clean and dry, use the sandpaper to smooth the surface and remove any rough spots. Wipe down the surface with the damp cloth to remove any dust or debris.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Apply the Spackling Paste</h2>

<p>Once the surface is prepared, you’ll need to apply the spackling paste. Dip the putty knife into the paste and spread it over the crack. Make sure to fill the crack completely and smooth out any excess paste. Allow the paste to fully dry before moving on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Apply the Masking Tape</h2>

<p>Once the spackling paste is dry, you’ll need to apply the masking tape. Start by cutting a piece of masking tape that’s slightly larger than the crack. Center the tape over the crack and press it firmly into place. Make sure to press down the edges of the tape to ensure a tight seal.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Sand and Paint</h2>

<p>Once the masking tape is in place, you’ll need to sand the area. Use the sandpaper to smooth out the surface of the tank cover. Once the area is smooth, you can paint the area to match the existing finish of the tank cover. Allow the paint to dry before replacing the tank cover on the toilet.</p>
