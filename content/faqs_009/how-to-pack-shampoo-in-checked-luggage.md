<p>Traveling with shampoo is a necessary part of any journey. Shampoo helps keep your hair healthy, vibrant and clean. But packing it in your checked luggage can be a challenge. It’s important to know how to properly pack shampoo in your checked luggage to prevent any leaks or spills. </p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Containers </h2>

<p>The first step in packing shampoo in checked luggage is to choose the right containers. If you’re only traveling with a few bottles of shampoo, you can usually just use the original containers. However, if you’re traveling with a large amount of shampoo, it’s best to transfer the shampoo into smaller, leak-proof containers. These containers should be made of thick plastic that won’t easily break. They should also be able to be securely sealed.</p>

<h2>Labeling the Containers </h2>

This will help prevent any shampoo from leaking out and ruining your clothes.</p>
