<p>As a young lad growing up in the rural parts of Scotland, I had a diet that was quite different from what many of us eat today. My family owned a farm and we ate a lot of eggs. We raised our own chickens, so it was easy to get a fresh supply of eggs. But I didn’t just eat one or two eggs a day. On special occasions, I would eat four dozen eggs!</p>

<p>My family was quite poor and there weren’t many other food items in the house. When I was a lad, eggs were a great source of protein and they were a lot cheaper than other meats.

It was one of my favorite desserts when I was a lad.</p>
