<p>Have you ever wanted to see the world in a different light? That is, without the visible spectrum that we’re so used to? Well, with the help of an iPhone, you can now see the infrared light spectrum that is usually invisible to the naked eye. </p>

<p>Infrared light is a type of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength longer than that of visible light. It’s also known as red light, and has many uses in science, medicine, and engineering. It can be used to detect heat, measure distances, and even diagnose medical conditions. </p>

<p>But it’s not just for the professionals. With a few easy steps, you can see this invisible light spectrum with your own eyes. Here, we’ll show you how to see infrared light with iPhone. </p>

<h2>What You Need to See Infrared Light with iPhone</h2>

<p>Before you can view the infrared spectrum, you’ll need a few items. First, you’ll need an iPhone or iPad with a compatible camera. Second, you’ll need a special infrared filter for the camera lens. Third, you’ll need an infrared light source to illuminate the scene you want to photograph. </p>

<p>The best way to get an infrared filter is to buy one online. You’ll want to find one that is specifically designed for the iPhone or iPad camera, as these are made to fit the camera lens perfectly. Once you have the filter, you can attach it to your phone or tablet’s camera lens. </p>

<p>The next step is to find an infrared light source. This can be a simple LED light, or a more complicated infrared lamp. The LED light is easier to find and cheaper to buy, but it won’t provide as much illumination as the infrared lamp. </p>

<h2>How to Set Up Your iPhone for Infrared Photography</h2>

<p>Once you have the filter and light source, the next step is to set up your iPhone for infrared photography. To do this, you’ll need to turn on the camera’s “Night Mode”. This can be found in the camera’s settings. When you activate Night Mode, the camera will automatically adjust its settings to take infrared photos. </p>

<p>Next, you’ll need to attach the infrared filter to the camera lens. Make sure the filter is securely attached, as it will need to remain in place for the duration of the photography session. </p>

<p>Finally, turn on the infrared light source and point it at the subject you want to photograph. Make sure the light is evenly distributed, as this will help ensure the best possible results. </p>

<h2>Taking Photos with Infrared Light</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve set up the camera, it’s time to start taking photos. Point the camera at the subject you want to photograph and press the shutter button. The camera will take a few seconds to adjust to the new light conditions, but once it does, you should be able to take photos with ease. </p>

<p>Depending on the light source you have, you may need to adjust the camera’s settings. For example, if you are using an LED light, you may need to adjust the camera’s exposure setting to get the best results. </p>

<p>Once you’ve taken the photos, you can view them on your iPhone or iPad. You should be able to see the infrared light clearly in the photos. </p>
