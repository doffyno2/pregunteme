<h2>Introduction</h2>

Removing a rounded bolt from a tight space can be a difficult and time-consuming task. It requires the right tools and techniques to be able to remove the bolt safely and quickly. In this article, we will discuss the various techniques and tools you can use to remove a rounded bolt from a tight space.

<h2>Tools Needed for Rounded Bolt Removal</h2>

In order to successfully remove a rounded bolt from a tight space, you will need to have the right tools. The most important tool for rounded bolt removal is an adjustable wrench. This tool allows you to grip the head of the bolt firmly, and apply the necessary torque to loosen the bolt.

If the rounded bolt has a hex head, you may also need a hex key or Allen wrench. This is a small tool that is used to loosen and tighten hexagonal screws and bolts.

Depending on the size and location of the rounded bolt, you may also need a ratchet and socket set. This set includes a ratchet handle and various sockets that can be used to loosen and tighten nuts and bolts.

<h2>Techniques for Removing a Rounded Bolt</h2>

Once you have the necessary tools, the next step is to use the right technique to remove the rounded bolt. Here are some of the most common techniques used for rounded bolt removal:

<h3>Pounding Technique</h3>

This technique involves pounding the head of the bolt with a hammer. This can be done with an adjustable wrench, or with a hammer and chisel. The idea is to use the force of the hammer to break the corrosion on the bolt, and to loosen it from the tight space. 

<h3>Heat Method</h3>

The heat method involves heating the bolt with a propane torch. This causes the metal to expand, which can help to loosen the bolt from its tight space. The heat should not be applied directly to the bolt, as this can cause damage to the metal and the surrounding area. Instead, the heat should be applied around the bolt, as this will cause it to expand and loosen.

<h3>Rust Remover</h3>

If the bolt has been corroded, then a rust remover can be used to help loosen the bolt from its tight space. This involves spraying a rust remover onto the bolt, and then letting it sit for a few minutes. This can help to break down the corrosion and loosen the bolt.
