Coyote hunting is a popular pastime among outdoorsmen, but it can be difficult to spot coyotes in the dark. Using the right color light when coyote hunting is essential to maximize your success. But what color light is best for coyote hunting? 

<h2>The Science Behind Coyote Sight</h2>

Coyotes have eyesight that is more sensitive to the green light spectrum than humans. This means that red or white light is often too bright for coyotes to see, and that green or yellow light will be better for coyote hunting. Coyote eyes have a tapetum lucidum, which is a reflective layer behind the retina that amplifies incoming light. This allows coyotes to see in the dark, but also makes them more sensitive to bright light. 

<h2>The Best Color Light for Coyote Hunting</h2>

The best color light for coyote hunting is green or yellow. These colors are less intense for coyotes, and will not scare them away like brighter colors such as red or white. Green and yellow lights will allow you to better spot coyotes in the dark, without scaring them away. 

<h2>Types of Lights for Coyote Hunting</h2>

There are several types of lights that you can use for coyote hunting. Flashlights are the most common and are available in a variety of colors. Spotlights are also popular, and many of them come with a green or yellow filter. There are also night vision devices that allow you to spot coyotes even in complete darkness. 

<h2>Using Lights for Coyote Hunting</h2>

When using a light for coyote hunting, you should always start with a low intensity light. This will allow you to spot coyotes without scaring them away. You should also use a light with a red or green filter, as this will reduce the brightness of the light and make it easier for coyotes to spot. You should also avoid shining the light directly into the eyes of coyotes, as this can be disorienting and cause them to flee. 

<h2>Other Tips for Coyote Hunting</h2>

In addition to using the right color light for coyote hunting, there are a few other tips that can help you be more successful. You should always wear camouflage, as this will help you blend into the environment and make it easier for coyotes to spot you. You should also use calls or decoys to attract coyotes, as this can make them more likely to come into range. Finally, you should always be aware of your surroundings and watch for signs of coyotes, such as tracks or scat. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The best color light for coyote hunting is green or yellow, as these are less intense for coyotes and will not scare them away. You should also use a low intensity light and a red or green filter, and avoid shining the light directly into the eyes of coyotes.
