As with most credit cards, there are certain rules and regulations when it comes to spending and earning rewards on the card.

<h2>The Basics of Eligible Travel Expenses</h2>

The Costco Citi Card rewards program offers a variety of rewards, but only certain types of travel expenses are eligible for rewards. To be eligible for rewards, the travel expense must be a purchase or charge made directly with the merchant, and not through a third-party service or website.

You must also use your Costco Citi Card when you are making the purchase in order for it to be eligible for rewards. This means that if you use another credit card or payment method, such as a debit card, check, or cash, the purchase will not be eligible for rewards.
