<p>Football is one of the most popular sports in the United States and around the world. Every year, millions of people tune in to watch the National Football League (NFL) and cheer on their favorite teams. With the popularity of the sport, it is no surprise that players and teams take every measure to ensure their safety on the field. One of the most important protective pieces of equipment for football players is the mouthguard. The NFL has stringent rules about what type of mouthguard players must wear and fines can be issued if players are not in compliance.</p>

<h2>What is a Mouthguard?</h2>

<p>A mouthguard is a protective device that is worn over the teeth and gums. It is designed to protect players from dental and oral injuries while participating in contact sports. The most common type of mouthguard is the stock or “boil and bite” variety, which is made of thermoplastic material and can be quickly molded to fit the teeth and gums. There are also custom-made mouthguards which are made by a dentist and provide the highest level of protection. These are usually more expensive and require more time to produce.</p>

<h2>Why Do NFL Players Wear Mouthguards?</h2>

<p>Mouthguards are a must for NFL players. While playing football, players are often exposed to hard contact, sharp objects, and flying projectiles. It is essential that players wear mouthguards to protect their teeth and gums from potential harm. In addition, wearing a mouthguard can also help to reduce the risk of a concussion due to the impact of a hit, as well as reduce the risk of neck injuries.</p>

<h2>What Type of Mouthguard Does the NFL Require?</h2>

The mouthguard must be either an over-the-counter stock mouthguard or a custom-made mouthguard that is made by a dentist. It must also be either clear or the same color as the player’s skin. The mouthguard must also be made of a material that is comfortable and non-abrasive.</p>

<h2>Does the NFL Provide Mouthguards?</h2>

<p>The NFL does not provide mouthguards to its players. Players are responsible for purchasing their own mouthguards and ensuring that they are in compliance with the NFL’s rules. Players can purchase mouthguards from their local sporting goods stores, online retailers, or from a dentist.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Penalties for Not Wearing a Mouthguard?</h2>

<p>Yes, if a player is not in compliance with the NFL’s mouthguard requirements, then he may be subject to a fine.
