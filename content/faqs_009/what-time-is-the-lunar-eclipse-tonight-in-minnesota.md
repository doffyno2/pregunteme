<p>Tonight is a special night for Minnesotans who are interested in astronomy. A lunar eclipse will be taking place, and those in the state will have the chance to witness a unique experience.</p>

<p>A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking the light from the Sun that normally illuminates the moon. This causes the moon to appear darker than normal and can be quite a sight to behold.</p>

<p>The eclipse will begin at 10:44 PM Central Time and will last for an hour and a half. The peak of the eclipse will occur at 11:41 PM Central Time, when the Moon will be in full shadow and the eclipse will appear most dramatic. </p>

<p>For those in the state, the best place to view the eclipse will be away from the city lights. Find a spot that has a clear view of the night sky and the Moon will be visible. It is best to view the eclipse without any optical equipment, as the naked eye is best for viewing the Moon. </p>
