<p>Lighting a propane torch without a striker is a simple yet effective way to get the job done. Whether you need to solder pipes, work on jewelry, or just need a quick light, this method will get you the flame you need. Here we will discuss the simple steps you need to take to get your propane torch up and running without a striker.</p>

<h2>Gather the Necessary Materials</h2>

<p>Before getting started, make sure that you have all the necessary materials. You will need a propane torch, a match or lighter, and a pair of protective gloves. Make sure the gloves fit properly and provide adequate protection.</p>

<h2>Turn on the Torch</h2>

<p>Once you have all the necessary materials gathered, you are ready to start the process. First, turn on the torch. This can be done by turning the switch on the handle of the torch to the "on" position. Make sure the flame size is set to low.</p>

<h2>Strike the Match or Lighter</h2>

<p>Next, strike the match or lighter and hold it close to the end of the torch. The flame should ignite and begin to burn. Make sure to keep the match or lighter close to the end of the torch until it is lit. Do not move the match or lighter away from the torch until the flame is lit.</p>

<h2>Adjust the Flame Size</h2>

<p>Once the flame is lit, you can adjust the size of the flame. This is done by turning the switch on the handle of the torch to the desired size. Make sure to adjust the flame size to the task you are performing. For soldering, a larger flame is needed, while for jewelry making a smaller flame is better.</p>

<h2>Turn off the Torch</h2>

<p>When you are finished with the torch, make sure to turn it off. This is done by turning the switch on the handle of the torch to the "off" position. Once the flame has been extinguished, you can safely put away the torch.</p>
