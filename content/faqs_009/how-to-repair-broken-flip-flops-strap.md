<p>Flip flops are a popular choice of footwear for beach days, poolside lounging, and summertime strolls. But one issue that can be a hindrance to those activities is a broken flip flop strap. Whether the strap has come loose from the sole or has frayed or torn, it can be a big hassle. Fortunately, repairing a broken flip flop strap is not as difficult as it may seem.</p>

<h2>What Tools Do You Need?</h2>

<p>The tools needed to repair a broken flip flop strap are pretty basic. A pair of scissors, a permanent marker, some adhesive (super glue, E-6000 or shoe goo), a few pieces of fabric and a surface to work on are all that is needed. 

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Mark the Strap</h3>

<p>The first step is to mark the strap where it needs to be reattached. This should be done with a permanent marker. This will help ensure that the strap is reattached in the right spot.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cut the Strap</h3>

<p>Once the strap is marked, it should be cut. If the strap is frayed, it should be cut close to the mark, leaving a small amount of frayed material. If the strap has come loose from the sole, it should be cut right at the mark.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Attach New Straps</h3>

<p>The next step is to attach new straps to the flip flop. This can be done by using adhesive to attach pieces of fabric or ribbon to the underside of the flip flop. It is important to make sure that the fabric or ribbon is securely attached and that it is the same length as the original strap.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Attach the Strap</h3>

<p>Once the fabric or ribbon is attached, the original strap can be reattached. This should be done with the same adhesive that was used to attach the fabric or ribbon. It is important to make sure that the strap is securely attached and that it is aligned with the mark made earlier.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Allow Adhesive to Dry</h3>

<p>Once the strap is attached, the adhesive should be allowed to dry. This usually takes a few hours, so it is important to allow enough time for the adhesive to dry before wearing the flip flops.</p>

<h2>Tips for Repairing Flip Flop Straps</h2>

<h3>Use Strong Adhesive</h3>

<p>It is important to use a strong adhesive when repairing flip flop straps. Super glue, E-6000, and shoe goo are all good options. These adhesives are designed to withstand the elements and will ensure that the straps remain securely attached.</p>

<h3>Test the Straps Before Wearing</h3>

<p>Once the straps have been repaired, it is important to test them before wearing them. This can be done by gently tugging on the straps to make sure that they are securely attached. If the straps come loose, they should be reattached with more adhesive.</p>
