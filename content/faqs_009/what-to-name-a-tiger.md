<p>Tigers are one of the world’s most iconic animals and have been a part of human culture for centuries. They are majestic, powerful creatures, and they inspire awe in those who observe them. With their distinct stripes and beautiful eyes, they make wonderful and loyal companions. When it comes to naming your tiger, there are many things to consider.
