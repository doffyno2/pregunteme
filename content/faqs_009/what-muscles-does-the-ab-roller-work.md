<h2>What Muscles Does the Ab Roller Work?</h2>

The ab roller is an effective exercise tool for targeting the abdominal muscles. It is a small wheel with two handles that you can roll forward and back. When you roll the wheel forward, your abdominal muscles are engaged and you will feel your core tighten. This exercise targets the rectus abdominis, also known as the "six-pack" muscles. The ab roller also works the transverse abdominis, which is the deep core muscle that wraps around the middle of your body and provides stability and strength. In addition, the obliques are also engaged when using the ab roller, which helps to build strength and tone your waistline.

Place the ab roller wheel at the top of your chest, just below your shoulders. Place your hands on the handles and roll the wheel forward until your elbows are straight. Keep your back straight and your core tight as you roll forward. Pause for a few seconds before rolling back to the starting position. Make sure to keep your abs tight and your body in a straight line throughout the entire movement.
