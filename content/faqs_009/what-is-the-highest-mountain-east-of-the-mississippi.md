The highest mountain east of the Mississippi River is Mount Mitchell in the Black Mountains of North Carolina. Located in the Appalachian Mountains, Mount Mitchell is the highest peak in the range, standing at 6,684 feet (2,037 meters) above sea level. The mountain is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains that extend from Virginia to Georgia.

<h2>History of Mount Mitchell</h2> 
Mount Mitchell has a long and interesting history. The peak was first identified in 1835 by Elisha Mitchell, a professor at the University of North Carolina. Mitchell was an avid explorer and naturalist who was determined to locate the highest peak east of the Mississippi. He first climbed Mount Mitchell in 1857, and upon reaching the summit, declared it to be the highest peak in the region.

Although Mitchell's declaration was initially disputed, his claim was eventually proven correct. Today, the mountain is named after him, as a tribute to his exploratory passion. 

<h2>Geology of Mount Mitchell</h2>
Mount Mitchell is located in the Black Mountains of North Carolina and is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The mountain is composed of metamorphic rock, which has been sculpted by millions of years of erosion, resulting in the steep peaks and valleys that make up the mountain's terrain. 

The mountain is part of the Pisgah National Forest, a protected federal forest that encompasses over 500,000 acres of land. The forest is home to a diverse range of wildlife species, such as black bears, white-tailed deer, and wild turkeys. 

<h2>Climbing Mount Mitchell</h2>
Mount Mitchell can be climbed year-round, though the conditions can be treacherous in the winter months. The peak is accessible via a series of trails that lead to the summit, with the most popular route being the Mount Mitchell Trail. This trail is 6.5 miles in length and is considered to be moderately difficult. 

The trail is marked with signage and is relatively well-maintained. However, it is recommended that climbers bring along a map and compass, as cell phone reception can be spotty at higher elevations. 

<h2>Camping on Mount Mitchell</h2> 
Camping is allowed on Mount Mitchell, though there are no designated campsites. Visitors may camp anywhere in the Pisgah National Forest, provided they follow the rules and regulations set forth by the Forest Service. 

It is important to note that bears are common in the area, so it is important to take the necessary precautions when camping on the mountain. This includes storing food in bear-proof containers and never leaving food or garbage unattended.

To the east, the Blue Ridge Mountains stretch as far as the eye can see. To the south and west, the rolling hills of North Carolina can be seen.
