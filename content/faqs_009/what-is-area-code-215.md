<p>Area code 215 is a telephone area code that covers Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and its surrounding suburbs. It was created in 1947 and is one of the original area codes in the United States. It is one of the two original area codes for the state of Pennsylvania, along with area code 412. It serves most of Philadelphia County and its suburbs in Montgomery, Bucks, and Delaware counties. It also serves parts of Chester, Berks, and Lehigh counties.</p>

<p>Area code 215 is an overlay area code, meaning that it covers the same geographic area as area code 267. This means that you must dial the area code along with the 7-digit telephone number for all calls within the 215/267 area code region. This applies even for local calls, so if you are calling someone in the same area code, you must dial the full 10-digit telephone number.</p>

<p>Area code 215 is the main area code for Philadelphia and its suburbs. It is also the area code for many large cities and towns in the region, such as Norristown, Doylestown, Lansdale, and Bethlehem. The area code is also used for some smaller towns and unincorporated areas in the region. It has been assigned to many cell phone numbers in the region as well.</p>

<h2>History of Area Code 215</h2>

<p>Area code 215 was created in 1947 as one of the original area codes in the United States. It was created from a split of area code 412, which originally covered all of Pennsylvania. As demand for telephone numbers increased in the region, area code 215 was split off to cover the Philadelphia area. This split left area code 412 covering the western part of the state.</p>

<p>In 1999, area code 215 was overlaid with area code 267. This overlay created a new 10-digit dialing requirement for all calls within the 215/267 area code region. The overlay also created the need for a new area code, 484, which was created in 1999 and covers the western part of the Philadelphia area.</p>

<h2>Geographic Scope of Area Code 215</h2>

<p>Area code 215 covers most of Philadelphia County and its suburbs in Montgomery, Bucks, and Delaware counties. It also covers parts of Chester, Berks, and Lehigh counties. Some of the larger cities and towns in the 215 area code include Philadelphia, Norristown, Doylestown, Lansdale, and Bethlehem.</p>

<p>The area code is also used for some smaller towns and unincorporated areas in the region. It has been assigned to many cell phone numbers in the region as well. The geographic scope of area code 215 has not changed since it was created in 1947.</p>
