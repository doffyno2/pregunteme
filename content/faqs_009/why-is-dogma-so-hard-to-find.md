<p>Dogma is a set of beliefs or principles that are accepted without question or doubt. It is often associated with religious belief systems, but can also apply to any set of rules and regulations that are believed to be absolute. Dogma has been around for centuries, and is still very much a part of many cultures and societies today. So why is it so hard to find?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is not a simple one. Dogma is often seen as a rigid set of beliefs and rules, and many people are uncomfortable with the idea of accepting something without question. This hesitance to accept dogma can be attributed to a variety of reasons, from fear of the unknown to an individual's personal beliefs. Additionally, many people view dogma as oppressive and restrictive, making it difficult for them to accept it.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons why dogma is so hard to find is because it is often associated with religion. Many religions have a set of beliefs that adherents are expected to follow without question, which can be difficult for some to accept. Additionally, some religions have strict rules about who can and cannot practice their faith, making it harder for those who don't fit the criteria to find a place in the faith. This can lead to feelings of exclusion, which can make it even more difficult to accept dogma.</p>

<p>Another reason why dogma is so hard to find is because it can be difficult to distinguish between dogma and opinion. Dogma is often seen as an absolute truth, while opinion can vary from person to person. This can make it difficult to determine which beliefs are dogma and which are opinion. Additionally, some people may find it hard to accept any set of beliefs without question, as they may feel that their own beliefs are valid and should be defended.</p>

<p>Finally, dogma can be seen as oppressive and restrictive, making it difficult for people to accept it. Dogma often requires people to adhere to a certain set of rules and regulations, which can be difficult for some to accept. Additionally, dogma can be seen as a form of control, as it can limit the freedom of individuals to think and act in certain ways. This can make it difficult for people to fully accept dogma.</p>

<h2>What is the Difference between Dogma and Opinion?</h2>

<p>The main difference between dogma and opinion is that dogma is often seen as an absolute truth and opinion can vary from person to person. Dogma is often associated with religious beliefs, while opinion can be based on personal values and beliefs. Additionally, many people view dogma as oppressive and restrictive, making it difficult for them to accept it.</p>

<p>Dogma is often seen as a set of unquestioned beliefs, while opinion is based on individual views and can vary from person to person. Additionally, opinion can be based on evidence and facts, while dogma is often seen as an absolute truth that cannot be questioned. This can make it difficult for some to accept dogma, as it may seem too restrictive or oppressive.</p>

<p>Another difference between dogma and opinion is that opinion can be changed or adjusted over time, while dogma is often seen as an unchanging set of beliefs. Additionally, opinion is often seen as being more flexible and open to debate, while dogma is often seen as unchangeable and absolute. This can make it difficult for some to accept dogma, as they may feel that their own beliefs should be respected and defended.</p>
