<p>7 Days To Die is an open world survival horror video game developed by The Fun Pimps, an independent video game development studio. The game has been praised for its unique and creative approach to the survival horror genre, with its combination of RPG, sandbox, and survival elements. One of the main objectives in the game is to survive for as long as possible, and one of the key resources for doing this is lead. Lead is used for crafting weapons, ammunition, and armor, and is essential for surviving the hordes of zombies that wander the world.</p>

<p>Lead can be found in a variety of places in 7 Days To Die. In the early game, most lead can be found in the form of scrap metal. Scrap metal can be found in piles around the world, mostly near buildings or in abandoned cars. Lead can also be found in loot crates, which are scattered around the world. Larger piles of scrap metal can also be found in scrapyards, and these will usually contain more lead than the smaller piles.</p>

<p>Lead can also be crafted in 7 Days To Die. To craft lead, players need to obtain the Lead Ore resource. Lead Ore can be mined from rocks with a pickaxe, and then smelted in a forge. Once the ore has been smelted, it can then be crafted into lead ingots. Lead ingots can then be used to craft weapons, ammunition, and armor.</p>

<p>Lead can also be purchased from traders that wander the world. Traders will often have lead in their inventory, and can be found in a variety of locations. To find traders, players should keep an eye out for the exclamation points that appear on the map.</p>
