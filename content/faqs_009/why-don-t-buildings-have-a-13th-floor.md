Why Don't Buildings Have a 13th Floor?


In some countries, there is a widespread belief that buildings should not have a thirteenth floor. This superstition has been around for centuries, and it has caused many buildings in the world to be built without a thirteenth floor. But why is this the case? What is the history behind this superstition? Is there any scientific evidence to back up the belief that a thirteenth floor should be avoided? Let’s take a closer look at why some buildings don’t have a thirteenth floor.

The belief that buildings should not have a thirteenth floor dates back to the ancient Babylonians.

This superstition was then passed down to the Romans, and it eventually spread to other parts of the world.

The belief that buildings should not have a thirteenth floor is not limited to the western world.
