<h2>Secondary Knife</h2>

<p>In addition to the Ka-bar, Navy SEALs also carry a secondary knife. This is usually a folding knife, such as the Benchmade Griptilian or the Spyderco Paramilitary 2. These knives are smaller than the Ka-bar and are used for tasks that require more precision, such as opening cans, cutting through wire, and for self-defense. They are also lightweight and easy to carry.</p>
