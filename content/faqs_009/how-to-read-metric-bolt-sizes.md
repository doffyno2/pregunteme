<p>Reading a metric bolt size can be a bit tricky at first, but once you understand the basics, it's a relatively easy task. Metric bolts are measured using two different systems: the metric system, which is based on the metric system of measurement, and the imperial system, which is based on the imperial system of measurement. In this article, we’ll explain the basics of metric bolt sizes and how to read them.</p>

<h2>What is a metric bolt size?</h2>

<p>A metric bolt size is a measurement of the diameter and length of a bolt. It is typically expressed in millimeters for metric bolts and in inches for imperial bolts. The diameter of a bolt is the distance from one end of the bolt to the other, measured at the widest point. The length of a bolt is the distance from the top of the head to the end of the shank. In some cases, the length may be expressed in threads per inch (TPI).</p>

<h2>Understanding Metric and Imperial Bolt Sizes</h2>

<p>Metric bolts are measured according to the metric system, which is based on the metric system of measurement. The metric system uses the letter “M” followed by a number to indicate the size of the bolt. For example, an M12 bolt has a diameter of 12 millimeters. An M16 bolt has a diameter of 16 millimeters. The length of the bolt is typically expressed in millimeters after the letter “M”. For example, an M12 x 30 bolt has a diameter of 12 millimeters and a length of 30 millimeters.</p>

<p>Imperial bolts are measured according to the imperial system, which is based on the imperial system of measurement. The imperial system uses the letter “F” followed by a number to indicate the size of the bolt. For example, an F8 bolt has a diameter of 8 inches. An F10 bolt has a diameter of 10 inches. The length of the bolt is typically expressed in inches after the letter “F”. For example, an F8 x 4 bolt has a diameter of 8 inches and a length of 4 inches.</p>

<h2>How to read metric bolt sizes</h2>

<p>Reading a metric bolt size is relatively easy once you understand the basics. The first step is to identify the letter that is used to indicate the size of the bolt. If the letter is “M”, then the size is expressed in millimeters. If the letter is “F”, then the size is expressed in inches. The next step is to identify the number that follows the letter. This number indicates the diameter of the bolt. The last step is to identify the number that follows the diameter. This number indicates the length of the bolt.</p>

<h2>Metric bolt size chart</h2>

<p>Below is a metric bolt size chart that shows the different sizes of metric bolts and their corresponding diameters and lengths. This chart can be used to help you determine the size of metric bolts that you need for your project.</p>
