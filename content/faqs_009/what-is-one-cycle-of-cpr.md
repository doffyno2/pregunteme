<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving technique used in medical emergencies. CPR is performed when the heart stops beating or when someone is not breathing normally. It is important to know how to perform CPR in case of an emergency. This article will discuss what one cycle of CPR is and how it is performed.</p>

<h2>What is One Cycle of CPR?</h2>

<p>One cycle of CPR is a combination of chest compressions and rescue breaths that are repeated to maintain circulation of oxygenated blood to the brain and other vital organs. A cycle of CPR consists of 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths. The compressions should be performed at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute and the breaths should be provided over 1-1.5 seconds. When providing chest compressions, the rescuer should make sure to press down at least 2-2.4 inches and allow the chest to return to its normal position after each compression.</p>

<h2>How is CPR Performed?</h2>

<p>CPR is a two-step process that consists of chest compressions and rescue breaths. Chest compressions are applied to the chest of the victim to help circulate oxygenated blood to the brain and other vital organs. Rescue breaths are given to the victim to help open the airway and provide oxygen to the lungs. The rescuer should begin the cycle of CPR by providing 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths. The rescuer should then repeat this cycle of 30 compressions and two breaths until help arrives.</p>

<h2>Who Should Receive CPR?</h2>

<p>CPR should be performed on any person who experiences sudden cardiac arrest or stops breathing. This includes people who experience a heart attack, stroke, drowning, or any other medical emergency. It is important to remember that CPR should only be performed by a trained and certified individual. If you are not trained or certified, you should call 911 and stay with the victim until help arrives.</p>

<h2>What Should I Do After Administering CPR?</h2>

<p>Once you have administered CPR, it is important to remain with the victim until help arrives. You should continue providing CPR until help arrives or the victim shows signs of life. It is also important to document the time and date that you provided CPR and any other information regarding the incident.</p>
