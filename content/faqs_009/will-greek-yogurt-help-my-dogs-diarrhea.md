<p>Diarrhea in dogs is a common and often frustrating problem that pet owners need to address. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, and the treatment will depend on the underlying cause.

<p>One of the dietary changes that pet owners consider is the addition of Greek yogurt to the dog's diet.
