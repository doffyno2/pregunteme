<p>Most cars require regular maintenance to keep them running smoothly and safely. The 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander is no exception. Fortunately, you can put it into maintenance mode using the onboard diagnostic system. This mode allows you to perform basic maintenance tasks, such as checking the oil level, tire pressure, and other components, without having to take it to a mechanic. Here's how to put your 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander into maintenance mode.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Locate the Onboard Diagnostic System</h2>

<p>The first step is to locate the onboard diagnostic system (OBD). This system is located under the dashboard. Open the hood of the car and locate the OBD port. It should be near the fuse box. Once you have located the OBD port, use a small flathead screwdriver to press the reset button. This will put the system into maintenance mode.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Enter the Maintenance Mode</h2>

<p>Once you have pressed the reset button, you will need to enter the maintenance mode. To do this, turn the ignition key to the “On” position. This will allow you to access the onboard diagnostic system. If the system is not in maintenance mode, you will need to press the reset button again.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Check the System</h2>

<p>Once you have entered the maintenance mode, you will be able to check the system. This includes checking the oil level, tire pressure, and other components. To check the oil level, turn the ignition key to the “Off” position and remove the dipstick. The dipstick should have a small amount of oil on it. If the oil level is low, top it up with the correct type of oil.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Check the Tire Pressure</h2>

<p>Next, check the tire pressure. To do this, turn the ignition key to the “On” position and press the reset button. This will allow you to access the tire pressure readings. Check the pressure of each tire and adjust it if necessary. The recommended tire pressure is usually found in the owner’s manual.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Check Other Components</h2>

<p>The next step is to check other components. This includes checking the spark plugs, air filter, and other components. To check the spark plugs, turn the ignition key to the “Off” position and remove the spark plug wires. Check the spark plugs for any signs of wear and tear. Replace them if necessary.</p>

<p>To check the air filter, turn the ignition key to the “On” position and press the reset button. This will allow you to access the air filter readings. Check the air filter for any signs of dirt or debris and replace it if necessary.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Exit Maintenance Mode</h2>

<p>Once you have checked all of the components, you can exit maintenance mode. To do this, turn the ignition key to the “Off” position and press the reset button again. This will cause the onboard diagnostic system to exit maintenance mode.</p>
