<p>Maintenance calls are a common occurrence when trading with TD Ameritrade, the leading online brokerage firm. These calls usually occur when an account reaches a certain level of activity, such as a large number of trades or a high balance. They are also triggered by certain activities, such as margin purchases or short sales.</p>

<p>When a maintenance call is triggered, TD Ameritrade sends a notification to the account holder. This notification will explain why the call was initiated, and what steps the account holder must take in order to satisfy the call. The account holder must then take action to resolve the call. Depending on the type of call, the account holder may be required to deposit additional funds or securities into the account, reduce the activity level, or close out certain positions.</p>

<p>If the account holder does not take action to resolve the call, TD Ameritrade may liquidate some or all of the account’s positions in order to satisfy the call. This means that the account holder could potentially lose money if the positions are liquidated at a loss. This is why it is important to take action to resolve the call as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When a maintenance call is triggered, the account holder has the option of speaking with a TD Ameritrade representative to discuss the issue. The representative will explain the call requirements and work with the account holder to resolve the call. The representative may also be able to provide additional guidance or suggest alternative solutions to the problem.</p>

<h2>What are the Different Types of Maintenance Calls?</h2>

<p>TD Ameritrade has several different types of maintenance calls. These include margin calls, options activity calls, short sale calls, and trading activity calls. They also have calls for accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>Margin calls are triggered when the account reaches a certain level of margin debt. This debt can be caused by purchasing securities on margin or by selling short. Options activity calls are triggered when the account has a high level of options activity. Short sale calls are triggered when a security is sold short and then rises in value. Trading activity calls are triggered when the account reaches a certain level of trading activity.</p>

<p>Inactive accounts are subject to maintenance calls if they remain inactive for an extended period of time. TD Ameritrade requires that an account be active at least once every twelve months. If an account remains inactive for longer than twelve months, a maintenance call may be triggered.</p>
