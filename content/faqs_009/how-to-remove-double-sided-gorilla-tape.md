<p>Gorilla Tape is one of the most popular and effective adhesives available on the market today. It is used in a variety of applications, from DIY projects to professional installations. As with any adhesive, however, it can sometimes be difficult to remove it from surfaces, especially when it is used in double sided configurations. In this article, we’ll explain how to remove double sided Gorilla Tape from a variety of surfaces. </p>

<h2>What is Double Sided Gorilla Tape?</h2>

<p>Double sided Gorilla Tape is a specialized adhesive tape that features two adhesive surfaces on either side of the backing. It is extremely strong and can be used to bond two surfaces together very strongly. It is commonly used to attach two objects together, such as two pieces of wood or two pieces of plastic. </p>

<h2>Why Would You Need to Remove Double Sided Gorilla Tape?</h2>

<p>Double sided Gorilla Tape can be a great way to attach two surfaces together, but it can also be difficult to remove when the time comes. It is particularly difficult to remove from smooth surfaces, such as glass or metal. It can also be difficult to remove from fabrics, as the adhesive tends to cling to the fibers. </p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed To Remove Double Sided Gorilla Tape</h2>

<p>Removing double sided Gorilla Tape from a variety of surfaces requires a few tools and materials. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A sharp knife or razor blade</li>
  <li>Rubbing alcohol</li>
  <li>A soft cloth</li>
  <li>A heat gun or hair dryer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps to Remove Double Sided Gorilla Tape</h2>

<p>Removing double sided Gorilla Tape depends on the surface it is stuck to. The following steps can be used to remove it from a variety of surfaces:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Cut Away Excess Tape</h3>

<p>The first step to removing double sided Gorilla Tape is to use a sharp knife or razor blade to cut away as much of the tape as possible. This will make the removal process much easier. Be sure to be very careful when using a sharp blade, as it can easily cause damage to the surface it is being removed from.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Apply Rubbing Alcohol</h3>

<p>Once the excess tape has been removed, the next step is to apply rubbing alcohol to the remaining adhesive. Rubbing alcohol is an effective solvent that can help to break down the adhesive. Apply the rubbing alcohol to a soft cloth and gently rub the adhesive until it begins to break down. </p>

<h3>Step 3: Heat The Adhesive</h3>

<p>If the rubbing alcohol does not completely remove the adhesive, the next step is to apply heat. This can be done with a heat gun or hair dryer. Be sure to keep the heat source moving and not to let it remain in one spot for too long. This can cause damage to the surface. </p>

<h3>Step 4: Scrape Away The Adhesive</h3>

<p>Once the adhesive has been softened by the heat, it can then be scraped away with a razor blade or sharp knife. Be sure to use caution when removing the adhesive, as it can still be quite sticky. </p>

<h3>Step 5: Clean The Surface</h3>

<p>Once the adhesive has been removed, it is important to clean the surface with a damp cloth. This will remove any remaining residue and help to restore the surface to its original condition. </p>
