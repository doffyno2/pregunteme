<p>For many of us, the three-day weekend is the highlight of our working week. No matter how long the week might have been, we always look forward to that extra day off. But while some of us might have a regular three-day weekend, others may have to wait a while before they can enjoy the luxury of a three-day weekend. So when is the next 3 day weekend?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on several factors. Firstly, it depends on your particular country or region.

<p>In the United States, the next three-day weekend is Memorial Day, which happens on the last Monday of May. This will be on May 31st, 2021. After that, the next three-day weekend is Independence Day, which is July 4th.  </p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, the next three-day weekend won’t be until August 28th, 2021, which is the Bank Holiday.  </p>
