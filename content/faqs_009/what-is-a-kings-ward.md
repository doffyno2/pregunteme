A King's Ward is a title given to a noble or important person who has been placed in the care of a monarch or other ruler. It is a practice that dates back to medieval times and is still used in some countries today.

<h2>History of the King's Ward</h2>

The practice of a King's Ward dates back to the Middle Ages, when it was a common practice for monarchs and rulers to take in young noble children and educate them in their court. These children would become part of the royal family, and be given the title of 'King's Ward'. The monarchs would use their influence and resources to ensure that the ward was given the best possible education and training, often in the same manner as the other members of the royal family.

The practice was used in many countries, including England, Scotland, France, Spain, Portugal, and many others. In England, the practice was known as 'bastardy wardship', and was used to ensure that young children of noble lineage were given a good education and upbringing.
