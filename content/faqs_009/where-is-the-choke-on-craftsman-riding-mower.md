<p>Craftsman is one of the most renowned names in the lawn and garden equipment industry, and their riding mowers are some of the most popular machines among home owners and commercial landscapers alike. If you have recently purchased or inherited a Craftsman riding mower, you may be wondering where the choke is located. The choke is an important part of the mower and it is essential for the proper functioning of the engine. In this article, we will discuss where to find the choke on a Craftsman riding mower, as well as how to properly use it.</p>

<h2>What is a Choke?</h2>

<p>A choke is a device that is used to regulate the air-fuel mixture in the engine of a lawn mower. It helps to ensure that the engine is running at the right temperature and is receiving the right amount of fuel. The choke is typically located near the carburetor, and it is usually operated by a lever that is connected to the throttle. When the lever is in the "on" position, it restricts the flow of air to the carburetor, which in turn causes the engine to run richer. When the lever is in the "off" position, it allows more air to flow to the carburetor, which helps to keep the engine running at the right temperature.</p>

<h2>Where is the Choke on a Craftsman Riding Mower?</h2>

<p>The choke on a Craftsman riding mower is typically located near the carburetor. On most models, it is a lever that is connected to the throttle, and it can be easily identified by its bright orange color. The lever should be clearly marked with an "on" and "off" position, and it should be in the "off" position when you start the mower.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Choke on a Craftsman Riding Mower?</h2>

<p>Using the choke on a Craftsman riding mower is easy. First, make sure that the choke lever is in the "off" position. Then, turn the key to start the engine. If the engine does not start right away, move the choke lever to the "on" position and try again. Once the engine starts, move the choke lever back to the "off" position and allow the engine to warm up for a few minutes. Once the engine is warm, you can move the choke lever back to the "off" position and begin mowing.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting a Craftsman Riding Mower Choke</h2>

<p>If your Craftsman riding mower is having trouble starting, or if it is running rough, the choke may be the culprit. If the choke lever is stuck in the "on" position, the engine may not be receiving enough air, and this can cause it to run rich and stall out. If this is the case, try cleaning the choke lever and carburetor, and make sure that the lever is moving freely. If the problem persists, it may be time to take your mower to a professional for servicing.</p>
