How to Stop Your Dog from Peeing on Baseboards



As pet owners, we can all agree that one of the most frustrating things to deal with is when our furry friends go to the bathroom where they’re not supposed to. Unfortunately, this is a common problem many pet owners face, and it can be particularly exasperating when your dog starts to pee on the baseboards of your home. Not only is it unsightly, but it can also be difficult to remove the smell completely once it has taken hold. 

In this article, we’ll discuss why dogs pee on baseboards and how to stop them from doing it. We’ll also provide some tips on how to clean and remove the smell from your home. 

<h2>Why Do Dogs Pee on Baseboards?</h2>

There are several reasons why dogs may pee on the baseboards of your home. It’s important to understand these reasons in order to properly address the problem. 

<h3>Marking Territory</h3>

One of the most common reasons why dogs pee on baseboards is to mark their territory. Dogs have a natural instinct to do this, and they may be inclined to mark the baseboards in order to establish that they are the dominant animal in the house. 

<h3>Inadequate Potty Training</h3>

Another reason why dogs pee on baseboards is that they may not have been adequately potty trained. If your dog has not been properly taught where they should and should not go to the bathroom, they may start to go on the baseboards as a way of finding a place to relieve themselves. 

<h3>Lack of Supervision</h3>

It’s also possible that your dog is peeing on the baseboards because they are not being supervised properly. If you are not paying attention to your dog and allowing them to roam freely around the house, they may be more likely to go to the bathroom in places where they shouldn’t. 

<h2>How to Stop Your Dog from Peeing on Baseboards</h2>

Now that you understand why your dog may be peeing on the baseboards, you can take steps to prevent them from doing so. 

<h3>Properly Train Your Dog</h3>

One of the best ways to stop your dog from peeing on the baseboards is to make sure they are properly trained. Take your dog to a professional dog trainer or enroll in a dog training class. This will help them to understand where they should and should not go to the bathroom. 

<h3>Provide Plenty of Potty Breaks</h3>

Make sure to provide your dog with plenty of potty breaks throughout the day. Take them outside at least every few hours so they can relieve themselves in the appropriate area. This will help to ensure that they are less likely to go to the bathroom in the house. 

<h3>Supervise Your Dog</h3>

It’s important to supervise your dog when they are in the house. Make sure to keep an eye on them at all times, so that you can catch them if they start to go to the bathroom in an inappropriate area. 

<h3>Provide an Appropriate Place to Pee</h3>

If your dog has a designated area where they can go to the bathroom, they will be less likely to pee on the baseboards. Make sure to provide your dog with a designated potty area that is away from the baseboards. 

<h2>How to Clean and Remove the Smell</h2>

It can be difficult to remove the smell of urine from your home, particularly if it has been left for a long period of time. Here are some tips on how to clean and remove the smell from your home. 

<h3>Use an Enzyme-Based Cleaner</h3>

The first step is to use an enzyme-based cleaner on the affected area. Enzyme-based cleaners are designed to break down the proteins in urine, which will help to remove the smell. Make sure to follow the instructions on the cleaner’s label. 

<h3>Vacuum the Area</h3>

Once you have used the cleaner, make sure to vacuum the area thoroughly. This will help to remove any remaining particles of urine and will help to prevent the smell from returning. 

<h3>Use Odor Neutralizers</h3>

You can also use odor neutralizers to help remove the smell from your home. These products are designed to absorb odors and will help to remove the smell of urine from your home. 

<h3>Use Baking Soda</h3>

Baking soda is an effective way to remove odors from your home. Sprinkle baking soda on the affected area and leave it for several hours before vacuuming it up. This will help to absorb the smell and will help to keep your home smelling fresh.
