<h2>Why Would a Dog Fake an Injury?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons why a dog may fake an injury. For example, if a dog is feeling anxious or scared, they may act out by faking an injury. This could be a way of seeking reassurance from their owners, or it could be a way of diverting attention away from the source of their anxiety.

Many owners will be worried and concerned when their dog appears to be in pain, and this can be an effective way of getting attention.</p>
