The pH of bottled water can vary greatly from one brand to the next. Knowing the pH of bottled water can help you make an informed decision about which bottled water to choose. In this article, we’ll discuss what bottled water has a high pH and explain why it’s important to know. 

<h2>What is pH?</h2>

pH stands for “potential hydrogen” and is a measure of how acidic or basic a liquid is. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Water that has a pH less than 7 is considered acidic, while water with a pH greater than 7 is considered alkaline or basic. 

<h2>Why is pH Important?</h2>

The pH of water can affect the taste, smell and overall quality of the water. Water with a low pH can be unpleasant to drink, as it may have an acidic or metallic taste. Additionally, water with a low pH can be corrosive to pipes and other plumbing fixtures, leading to costly repairs.
