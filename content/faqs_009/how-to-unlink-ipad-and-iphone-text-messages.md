<p>Do you have an iPad and iPhone and want to unlink their text messages? If so, you’re not alone—many people have both devices and find it difficult to keep their text messages separate. Fortunately, it’s easy to unlink iPad and iPhone text messages so that each device has its own set of messages. Here’s how you can do it in a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>1. Set up Separate Apple IDs</h2>
