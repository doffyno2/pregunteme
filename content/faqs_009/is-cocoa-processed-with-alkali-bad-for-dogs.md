<p>Having a pup in the family is always a source of joy, but also a lot of responsibility. Dog owners want to make sure their pets are healthy and happy, and that starts with understanding what they can and can’t eat. Cocoa is a common ingredient in many pet treats, but is cocoa processed with alkali bad for dogs?</p>

<p>Cocoa powder is derived from cocoa beans, which are the same beans used to make chocolate. The beans are roasted and then ground into a paste which is then processed with alkali.

The alkali used to process cocoa powder is called potassium carbonate and is a caustic material. If ingested, it can cause gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, and even damage to the esophagus and stomach.</p>
