A blood clot behind the knee, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a serious medical condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. It occurs when a deep vein in the leg becomes blocked by a blood clot, which can lead to a range of serious problems if left untreated. The symptoms of a blood clot behind the knee can vary from person to person, but they can include pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the affected area. It is important to recognize these symptoms and seek medical attention as soon as possible to reduce the risk of complications.
