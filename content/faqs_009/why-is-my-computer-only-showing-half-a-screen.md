<p>It can be extremely frustrating when your computer screen is only showing half of what it should be displaying. There can be a number of different causes for this issue, and it is important to identify the root cause before attempting to fix the problem. In this article, we will discuss some of the most common reasons why your computer might be exhibiting this behavior and what you can do to rectify the issue.</p>

<h2>Hardware Issues</h2>

<p>The first thing you should check when your computer is only showing half the screen is the hardware. It is possible that the display cable or the connector that links the display to the computer is loose or has become disconnected. If this is the case, you can simply reconnect the cable and the issue should be resolved. If the cable is not loose, then it may be damaged or faulty, in which case you will need to replace it.</p>

<h2>Software Issues</h2>

<p>Another potential cause of your computer only showing half a screen is software-related. It is possible that there is a problem with the operating system or graphics drivers on your computer. If this is the case, you can try updating the drivers or reinstalling the operating system to see if this resolves the issue.</p>

<h2>Incorrect Settings</h2>

<p>It is also possible that the settings on your computer are incorrect. For example, if you have connected a second monitor to your computer and have not configured the display settings correctly, then this could cause the issue. You can check the settings by going to the control panel and selecting the display tab.</p>

<h2>Overheating</h2>

<p>Finally, it is possible that your computer is overheating. If the internal components of your computer become too hot, then this can cause the display to malfunction. This is particularly likely if your computer is located in an area of your home or office that is poorly ventilated. You can try cleaning the vents and adding additional fans to help keep your computer cool.</p>
