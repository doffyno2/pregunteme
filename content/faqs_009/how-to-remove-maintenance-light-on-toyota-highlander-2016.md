<p>The Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size crossover SUV known for its rugged durability and stylish looks. The 2016 model year has been well-received by drivers, but as with any vehicle, it requires regular maintenance to keep it running smoothly. One common issue that can affect the Highlander is the maintenance light, which may come on due to a variety of issues. In this article, we'll look at what causes the maintenance light to come on and how to reset it.</p>

<h2>What Causes the Maintenance Light to Come On?</h2>

<p>The maintenance light on the Toyota Highlander will typically come on when the vehicle is due for an oil change, but there may be other underlying issues that could also cause it to turn on. Some of the most common causes of the maintenance light coming on are a failed oxygen sensor, a faulty catalytic converter, a clogged air filter, a bad spark plug, or a low coolant level. If you're unsure what's causing the light to come on, it's best to take your Highlander to a qualified mechanic for a diagnostic check.</p>

<h2>How to Reset the Maintenance Light</h2>

<p>Once you've identified and fixed the issue that's causing the maintenance light to come on, you can reset it by following these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn the ignition off.</li>
