<p>A straw fedora is an iconic hat that’s been in style for many years. It has a timeless style that looks good on everyone and can be worn to a variety of events. Unfortunately, a straw fedora may sometimes become misshapen or lose its shape. If this happens, you can easily reshape your straw fedora at home with a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>

<p>Before you start the reshaping process, you’ll need a few items. Grab a spray bottle, a few towels, and some steam. You can use either a garment steamer or boiling water to create steam. You’ll also need a few items to help support the shape of the hat while it’s drying. This could be a hat stand or a bowl that’s the same shape as the hat. You’ll also need some heavy books or a hat block.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Steam the Hat</h2>

<p>Start by steaming the hat using the garment steamer or boiling water. Hold the hat about 6-8 inches away from the steamer and steam for about 30 seconds. The heat and steam will help loosen up the fibers in the hat, making it easier to reshape. Make sure you don’t get too close to the steamer, as this can cause the straw to shrink or become discolored.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Shape the Hat</h2>

<p>Once the hat has been steamed, it’s time to reshape it. Start by gently molding the hat into the desired shape. Use your hands to make small adjustments to the brim and crown of the hat. If you’re using a hat block or bowl, you can place the hat over it and use it as a guide. You can also use books to help shape the brim.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Let the Hat Dry</h2>

<p>Once you’ve shaped the hat, place it on a hat stand or bowl and let it dry. Place a few heavy books on top of the brim to help keep it in place. You can also use a hair dryer on a low setting to speed up the drying process. Make sure the hat is completely dry before you remove the books.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Spray the Hat</h2>

<p>Once the hat is dry, use a spray bottle to lightly mist the hat with water. This will help lock in the shape and ensure that the hat maintains its shape. Let the hat air dry or use a hairdryer to speed up the process.</p>
