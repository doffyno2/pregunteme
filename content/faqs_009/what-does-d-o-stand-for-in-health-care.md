<p>D.O. stands for Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, which is a type of medical doctor who is licensed to practice medicine in the United States. D.O.s focus on holistic, preventative care and the body's musculoskeletal system. They have the same medical training and are considered equal to Medical Doctors (MDs).</p>

<h2>What is Osteopathic Medicine?</h2>

<p>Osteopathic medicine is a branch of medicine that focuses on the body’s musculoskeletal system. This includes the spine, joints, and muscles. Osteopaths are trained to diagnose and treat medical issues with a holistic approach. This means they look at a patient’s lifestyle, environment, and emotional well-being in addition to the physical aspects of their condition.</p>

<p>Osteopathic medicine is based on the idea that the body is made up of interconnected systems, and if one system is out of balance, it can affect the other systems. Osteopaths use a variety of techniques, such as manipulation and massage, to restore balance to the body and promote healing.</p>

<h2>What Do D.O.s Do?</h2>

<p>D.O.s are trained to diagnose and treat medical conditions in the same way as MDs. They can prescribe medications and order tests, just like any other doctor. However, D.O.s are more likely to take a holistic approach to patient care. They may take into account the patient’s emotional and environmental factors, as well as lifestyle habits, in order to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.</p>

<p>D.O.s are also more likely to use a hands-on approach to treatment. They may use manipulation, massage, and other manual therapies to treat medical problems. These therapies can be used to treat pain, reduce stress, and improve overall health.</p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between an MD and a D.O.?</h2>

<p>The main difference between an MD and a D.O. is the emphasis they put on preventive care and holistic treatment. MDs typically focus on treating illness and injury with medications and surgery, while D.O.s focus on preventing illness and injury by promoting healthy lifestyle habits and using manual therapies.</p>

<p>MDs and D.O.s both have the same medical training and are both licensed to practice medicine in the United States. They can both diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries, prescribe medications, and order tests.</p>

<h2>What Does it Take to Become a D.O.?</h2>

<p>Becoming a D.O. requires four years of medical school, followed by a one-year residency program. During medical school, students learn the same basic medical knowledge as MDs, plus additional courses in osteopathic philosophy and manual medicine. During the residency program, students refine their skills in diagnosis, treatment, and patient care.</p>

<p>Once a student has graduated from medical school, they must pass a licensing exam in order to practice medicine as a D.O. In the United States, D.O.s must also complete a one-year residency program in order to practice medicine.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Seeing a D.O.?</h2>

<p>Seeing a D.O. can offer many benefits to patients. D.O.s tend to have a more holistic approach to patient care, taking into account the patient’s emotional and environmental factors, as well as lifestyle habits, in order to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.</p>

<p>D.O.s are also more likely to use manual therapies, such as manipulation and massage, to treat medical problems. These therapies can be used to treat pain, reduce stress, and improve overall health.</p>
