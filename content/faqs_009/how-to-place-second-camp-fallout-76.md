<p>Fallout 76 has been a bit of a controversial game, but it's still a great experience for those who want to explore the world of the post-apocalyptic West Virginia. One of the features in the game is the ability to set up second camps. This can be a great way to experience a different part of the game, or to simply spend some time away from your main camp. In this article, we'll explain how to place your second camp in Fallout 76.</p>

<h2>What is a Second Camp?</h2>

<p>A second camp in Fallout 76 is a small settlement that you can create and place in a new location on the map. These camps are completely separate from your main camp and come with their own set of bonuses and benefits. They are a great way to expand your presence in the game and provide an extra layer of protection for your main camp. They can also be used to explore different parts of the map and take on new challenges.</p>

<h2>How to Place Your Second Camp in Fallout 76</h2>

<p>Placing your second camp in Fallout 76 is a fairly simple process. First, you'll need to make sure that you have the required C.A.M.P. budget, which is the in-game currency that you use to place camps.
