North America has a wide variety of bird species, ranging from tiny hummingbirds to large eagles. But which bird is the biggest of them all? The answer may surprise you: the biggest bird in North America is the California condor.

<h2>A Brief Overview of the California Condor</h2>

The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) is the largest bird in North America, and one of the largest flying birds in the world. It has a wingspan of up to 10 feet and can weigh up to 25 pounds. The California condor is native to the western half of the United States, and is found mainly in Arizona, California, and Utah. It is classified as “critically endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

The California condor is a large vulture, with a bald head and neck, and a black body. Its wings are broad and dark, and its tail is long and curved.
