Keying a car is a form of vandalism and a serious crime, so it is important to know what it looks like. Keying a car involves using either a sharp object or a key to scratch the paint off of the car, leaving a deep and often visible scratch. Keying a car can be done in a few different ways, and understanding what it looks like can help you identify if your car has been keyed and take the appropriate steps.

<h2>What Are the Different Ways to Key a Car?</h2>

There are a few different ways that someone can key a car. The most common method is using a key or some type of sharp object to scrape or scratch the paint off of the car. This can be done with either a single key or multi-pronged object, and the damage created is often very visible. Another method of keying a car is to use a sharp object to gouge into the paint, creating a deep and wide scratch. This type of damage is often more difficult to repair and may cost more than the traditional keying method.

<h2>What Does Keying a Car Look Like?</h2>

The most common type of keying is when someone scrapes the paint off of the car with a key or sharp object. This type of damage usually looks like a long, deep scratch that runs along the length of the car. The scratch will most likely be very visible and can range from a few inches to several feet in length. Depending on the type of object used, the scratch will often have a jagged or grooved appearance. If a multi-pronged object is used, there may be multiple scratches, all of which will be very deep and visible.

The other type of keying, when a sharp object is used to gouge the paint, usually looks like a deep, wide scratch that is several inches in length. The scratch will be very visible and the paint may have been peeled away in some areas. This type of damage is often more difficult to repair and may require professional help.

<h2>What Should You Do If Your Car Has Been Keyed?</h2>

If you suspect that your car has been keyed, the first thing you should do is contact the police to file a report. This will not only help the police investigate the crime, but it will also provide you with a record of the incident if you need to make an insurance claim.

Next, you should take pictures of the damage and document it as best as you can. This will be helpful for both the police investigation and for any insurance claims you may need to make. 

Finally, you should take your car to a professional body shop to get the damage repaired. Depending on the type and severity of the keying, you may need to get the car repainted.
