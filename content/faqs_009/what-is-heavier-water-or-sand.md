<p>Water and sand, two of the most common substances on Earth, are often compared to one another. While both are essential to life on Earth, the two substances have different properties and behave differently. One of the primary differences between water and sand is their weight. So, which is heavier – water or sand?</p>

<h2>The Density of Water and Sand</h2>

<p>The density of a substance is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume. Water and sand have different densities, which means that they have different masses for the same volume. The density of water is 1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, while the density of sand varies depending on the type of sand and its composition. The average density of sand is 1.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which means that it is denser than water.</p>

<h2>The Weight of Water and Sand</h2>

<p>Since sand is denser than water, it also has a greater mass per volume. This means that sand is heavier than water. A cubic centimeter of water has a mass of 1 gram, while a cubic centimeter of sand has a mass of 1.6 grams. Thus, sand is 60% heavier than an equal volume of water.</p>

<h2>The Weight of Water and Sand in Larger Quantities</h2>

<p>The difference in weight between a given volume of water and a given volume of sand is greater in larger quantities. For example, a cubic meter of water weighs 1,000 kilograms, while a cubic meter of sand weighs 1,600 kilograms. This means that a cubic meter of sand is 60% heavier than a cubic meter of water.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, sand is heavier than water. This is due to the difference in the density of the two substances. Sand is denser than water, which means that it has a greater mass per volume. This means that a given volume of sand is heavier than an equal volume of water, and the difference in weight is greater in larger quantities. Therefore, sand is heavier than water.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is the difference between water and sand?</h3>

<p>The primary difference between water and sand is their density. Water has a density of 1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, while the density of sand varies depending on its composition. The average density of sand is 1.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which means that it is denser than water.</p>

<h3>Is sand heavier than water?</h3>
