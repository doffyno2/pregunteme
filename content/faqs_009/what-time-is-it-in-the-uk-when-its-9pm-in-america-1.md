The time difference between the two countries is five hours.</p>

<h2>Calculating the Time in the UK When it's 9pm in America</h2>

It's important to note that this calculation only works when both countries are either observing Daylight Saving Time (DST) or not observing DST. If one country is observing DST and the other is not, the calculation will be different.</p>

<h2>Daylight Saving Time (DST)</h2>

<p>Daylight Saving Time (DST) is a system that is used to save energy by shifting the clock forward one hour in the spring and back one hour in the fall. In the United States, DST starts on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. In the United Kingdom, DST starts on the last Sunday of March and ends on the last Sunday of October.</p>

<p>When one country is observing DST and the other is not, the time difference between them changes. For example, when the United States is observing DST and the United Kingdom is not, the time difference between the two countries is four hours instead of five. This means that if it's 9pm in America, it's 5pm in the UK.</p>

To calculate the time in the UK when it's 9pm in America, you need to subtract five hours from the time in America. However, if one country is observing DST and the other is not, the time difference between them changes and the calculation will be different.</p>
