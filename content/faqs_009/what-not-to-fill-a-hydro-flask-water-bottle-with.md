<p>Hydro Flasks are becoming increasingly popular as a way to stay hydrated and reduce the use of single-use plastic bottles. While the stainless steel and BPA-free construction of these water bottles makes them safe for liquids, there are still some substances that should never be put in a Hydro Flask. If youâ€™re looking for ways to stay hydrated, here are some things that you should never put in a Hydro Flask.</p>

<h2>1. Carbonated Beverages</h2>

<p>Carbonated beverages such as soda, sparkling water, and sparkling juices should never be put in a Hydro Flask. These beverages contain carbon dioxide, which can cause the bottle to expand and potentially burst. Additionally, the acidity of these drinks can damage the stainless steel and BPA-free lining of the Hydro Flask, making it unsafe for use.</p>

<h2>2. Hot Liquids</h2>

<p>While Hydro Flasks are designed to keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours, they are not designed to keep drinks hot. Putting hot liquids in a Hydro Flask can cause the bottle to warp and may also damage the plastic lining of the bottle. Additionally, hot liquids may cause the bottle to leak, which can be a safety hazard.</p>

<h2>3. Dairy Products</h2>

<p>Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cream should never be put in a Hydro Flask. Dairy products can spoil quickly and can create an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. Additionally, dairy products can leave a residue behind that can be difficult to remove and may cause the bottle to smell or taste unpleasant.</p>

<h2>4. Alcoholic Beverages</h2>

<p>Alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine should not be put in a Hydro Flask. Alcoholic beverages contain sugar, which can cause the bottle to become sticky and attract bacteria. Additionally, alcohol can corrode the stainless steel and BPA-free lining of the bottle, making it unsafe for use.</p>

<h2>5. Fruits and Vegetables</h2>

<p>Fruits and vegetables should never be put in a Hydro Flask. Fruits and vegetables contain natural sugars that can cause the bottle to become sticky and attract bacteria. Additionally, fruits and vegetables may cause the bottle to become discolored and may leave a residue behind.</p>
