Throughout the world, there are many things that occur at different intervals of time. Some things occur once a week, some occur twice a month, and some occur once a year. But what occurs once in a minute, twice in a week and once in a year? 

<h2>What Occurs Every Minute?</h2>

The most obvious answer to the question is that the Earth rotates once in a minute. The Earth rotates on its axis at a rate of approximately 1,037 miles per hour. This results in the Earth rotating once in a minute, which is why day and night occur. 

<h2>What Occurs Twice a Week?</h2>

While there are many things that occur twice a week, the most common occurrence is that two days pass. This happens because the Earth rotates once in a day, and therefore two days pass every week. 

<h2>What Occurs Once a Year?</h2>

The most common occurrence that happens once a year is that the Earth completes one orbit around the sun. This is what causes the seasons to change, and it takes approximately 365.25 days for the Earth to complete one orbit. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In conclusion, the answer to the question of what occurs once in a minute twice in a week and once in a year is that the Earth rotates once in a minute, two days pass every week, and the Earth completes one orbit around the sun once a year. This is what causes the seasons to change and why day and night occur.
