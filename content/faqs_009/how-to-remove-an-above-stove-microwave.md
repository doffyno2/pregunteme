<p>Removing an above stove microwave is not as difficult as it may seem. With the right tools and safety precautions, you can easily remove your old microwave and replace it with a new one. In this article, we will discuss the steps you need to take to safely and effectively remove an above stove microwave.</p>

<h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
<p>Before you get started, it is important to take some safety precautions. First, make sure the power to the microwave is disconnected. This can be done by unplugging the cord from the wall outlet or by flipping the circuit breaker in the main electrical panel. Additionally, be sure to wear protective eyewear and gloves while working.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed</h2>
<p>Before you begin, gather all the necessary tools and materials. You will need a screwdriver, adjustable wrench, pliers, and a level. Additionally, you may need a drill, depending on how your microwave is mounted. You may also need a pry bar to help remove the trim molding and a stepladder if your microwave is high up.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Remove the Trim Molding</h2>
<p>The trim molding is a piece of wood or plastic that is used to cover the gap between the wall and the microwave. To remove the trim molding, use a pry bar to gently pry it away from the wall. Be careful not to damage the wall.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Mounting Brackets</h2>
<p>Once the trim molding has been removed, you can access the mounting brackets. The mounting brackets are usually attached to the wall with screws. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws and then gently pull the mounting brackets away from the wall.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Remove the Microwave</h2>
<p>Once the mounting brackets have been removed, you can remove the microwave. To do this, grab the top of the microwave with one hand and the bottom with the other. Gently lift the microwave off the wall and place it on a flat surface. If the microwave is too heavy to lift, ask someone to help you.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Clean Up</h2>
<p>Once the microwave has been removed, you can clean up. Vacuum any debris that may have fallen during the removal process and wipe any dust or dirt that may be present. Finally, check the wall for any cracks or damage that might have occurred during the removal process.</p>
