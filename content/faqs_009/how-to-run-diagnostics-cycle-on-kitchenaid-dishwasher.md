<h2>What Is a Diagnostic Cycle on a Dishwasher?</h2>
A diagnostic cycle is an automated process that is used to detect and diagnose any problems in a dishwasher. During a diagnostic cycle, the dishwasher performs a series of tests to check for possible issues. The tests include checking the water level, temperature, and pressure, as well as checking the operation of the drain pump and motor.

Running a diagnostic cycle on your dishwasher can help identify any potential problems with your machine before they become serious and costly. It can also help determine whether your dishwasher is running efficiently or not. For example, if the diagnostic cycle reveals that the water pressure is too low, this could be an indication that the machine isn't getting enough water to clean your dishes properly.
