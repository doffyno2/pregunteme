<p>Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to treat bacterial infections in dogs. But, one of the side effects of taking antibiotics is drowsiness. So, when it comes to the question of whether antibiotics make dogs sleepy, the answer is yes, in some cases.</p>

<p>When considering whether antibiotics make dogs sleepy, it's important to understand how antibiotics work. Antibiotics are substances that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. They work by targeting specific bacteria and preventing them from reproducing. In the process, they can also kill beneficial bacteria in the body.</p>

<p>The side effects of antibiotics can vary depending on the type of drug being used and the individual dog. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. But, one of the most common side effects is drowsiness. This is because some antibiotics can cause sedation, which can make a dog feel sleepy.</p>

<p>It's important to note that not all antibiotics will make a dog sleepy. Some may not have any effect on the dog's energy level. In addition, if a dog is already feeling tired or stressed, the antibiotics may make them even more tired. For example, if a dog is already feeling stressed due to a recent illness or surgery, the additional sedative effect of the antibiotics may make them even more tired.</p>
