Moonlighter is a popular action RPG game that has become an instant hit with players from all around the world. The game focuses on the adventures of Will, a shopkeeper who moonlights as an adventurer in order to make enough money to keep his shop running. As players progress through the game, they must manage their inventory, upgrade their equipment, and take on increasingly challenging enemies. One of the most important aspects of the game is managing your backpack size, as it determines how much gear and loot you can carry with you at any given time. 

<h2>What Is Backpack Size?</h2>

Backpack size is a measure of the maximum amount of items that can fit into your backpack in Moonlighter. This number is determined by the size of your backpack, which can be increased by upgrading it. The larger the backpack, the more items you can store. Items stored in the backpack can be used during battle, sold in your shop, or combined to create powerful new items.

<h2>How Can You Increase Your Backpack Size?</h2>

The first way to increase your backpack size is to upgrade it. As you progress through the game, you will be able to purchase upgrades for your backpack from the Blacksmith. These upgrades will increase the size of your backpack and allow you to carry more items. It is important to note that the upgrades are expensive, so you should save your money to be able to purchase them.

The second way to increase your backpack size is to use special items. There are a few special items that can be used to increase the size of your backpack. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the game world, or purchased from the Blacksmith.

The third way to increase your backpack size is to combine items. By combining two or more items, you can create a new item that takes up less space in your backpack. This is a great way to make room for more items without having to purchase upgrades or special items.
