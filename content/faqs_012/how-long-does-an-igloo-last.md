<p>An igloo is an iconic and traditional form of winter housing that is used by the Inuit people in the Canadian Arctic. It is a dome-shaped structure made of blocks of snow and other materials, and is designed to provide insulation against the extreme cold temperatures of the northern environment. While an igloo may look fragile, in reality, it is capable of lasting for many years. But just how long does an igloo last?</p>

<h2>What Are the Different Types of Igloos?</h2>

<p>The traditional igloo is the most well-known type of igloo, and has been used by the Inuit people for centuries. It is usually made of blocks of snow that are shaped and placed in a spiral pattern to form a dome. This type of igloo is fairly easy to construct, and can be done in a few hours with the help of a few people. It is also one of the most durable types of igloo, and can last for several years if it is built and maintained properly.</p>

<p>There are also other types of igloos that have been developed over the years, such as the quinzhee, which is a dome-shaped snow shelter made out of snowdrifts, and the snow cave, which is a shelter that is dug out of the snow. These types of igloos are usually slightly less durable than the traditional igloo, as they are not as stable and require more maintenance.</p>

<h2>How Long Does an Igloo Last?</h2>

<p>The amount of time that an igloo lasts depends on several factors, such as the type of igloo, the weather conditions, and the amount of maintenance that is done on the igloo. A traditional igloo made of blocks of snow can last for several years if it is built and maintained properly. The quinzhee and snow cave igloos will usually last for a few months, depending on the weather conditions.</p>

<p>The longevity of an igloo also depends on how well it is built, as a poorly constructed igloo will be less durable and will need to be replaced more often. An igloo should be built with blocks of snow that are as even as possible, and should be tightly packed together to form a dome shape. It is also important to dig a trench around the igloo to help prevent snow from drifting inside and melting the blocks of snow.</p>

<h2>How to Maintain an Igloo</h2>

<p>In order to make sure that an igloo lasts for as long as possible, it is important to maintain it properly. A traditional igloo should be checked regularly for any signs of melting or cracking, and any repairs should be done as soon as possible. The quinzhee and snow cave igloos should also be checked regularly for any signs of collapse or other damage.</p>

<p>It is also important to make sure that the igloo is well-insulated, as this will help to keep it from melting too quickly. Adding layers of snow or other insulating materials, such as blankets or tarps, around the igloo can help to keep it warm and dry. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the entrance to the igloo is well sealed to keep out the cold air.</p>
