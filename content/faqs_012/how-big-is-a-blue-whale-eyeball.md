<p>Most of us are familiar with the blue whale, the largest mammal in the world. Despite its size, however, most of us are unaware of just how big its eyeball is. There are a number of fascinating facts about the blue whale's eyeball that many people don't know. In this article, we'll take a look at what we know about the size of its eyeball and explore some of the interesting things that make it so special.</p>

<h2>How Big is a Blue Whale Eyeball?</h2>

<p>The blue whale's eyeball is incredibly large. It measures roughly 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) across and weighs anywhere from 4-6 ounces (113-170 grams). This makes it one of the largest eyeballs in the animal kingdom. It is also one of the most powerful, with an estimated visual acuity of 20/80. This means that it can see objects clearly from a distance of 20 feet away, the same as a person with 20/20 vision can.</p>

<h2>What Makes the Blue Whale's Eyeball so Unique?</h2>

<p>The blue whale's eyeball is incredibly unique in a number of ways. Firstly, its large size allows it to take in more light than the eyes of other animals. This gives the blue whale better vision in the dark and helps it to see further underwater. It also has a larger than average cornea, which helps it to focus on objects more clearly.</p>

<p>Another unique feature of the blue whale's eyeball is its location. Blue whales have eyes located on the sides of their heads, which gives them a wider field of view than many other animals. This allows them to spot potential predators from further away and gives them an advantage in the wild.</p>

<h2>What Else Can We Learn from the Blue Whale's Eyeball?</h2>

<p>The blue whale's eyeball can tell us a lot about the animal's behavior and its environment. For example, the size of its eyeball is a good indicator of the amount of light available to it. The larger the eyeball, the more light it can take in, and the better its vision will be in low light environments. This gives us insight into the blue whale's natural habitat and how it is able to survive.</p>

<p>In addition, the blue whale's eyeball can tell us a lot about its evolution. Its large size is believed to be a result of its need to see predators from a long distance. This has allowed the blue whale to survive for millions of years and become the largest mammal on Earth.</p>
