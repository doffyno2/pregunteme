Bike shorts are a popular item of clothing among cyclists, and it’s not uncommon to see them worn with a pair of shorts over the top. But why would someone do this? Is it really necessary or is it just a fashion choice? In this article, we’ll take a look at whether you should wear shorts over bike shorts or not.

<h2>What Are Bike Shorts?</h2>

Bike shorts are a special type of clothing designed specifically for cycling. They are usually made from stretchy Lycra fabric, which provides a snug fit that won’t bunch up as you ride. Bike shorts also have a padded insert in the crotch area, which helps protect against chafing and discomfort. This is especially important for long rides, where you’ll be in the saddle for hours at a time.

<h2>Why Wear Shorts Over Bike Shorts?</h2>

There are a few reasons why someone might choose to wear shorts over bike shorts. The most common reason is for modesty – bike shorts are tight-fitting and can be revealing, especially when riding in a bent-over position. Wearing a pair of regular shorts over the top can provide some extra coverage, which can be especially helpful for women. 

Another reason why someone might opt to wear shorts over bike shorts is for warmth. On colder days, the extra layer of clothing can keep you much warmer than if you were just wearing bike shorts alone. 

<h2>What Kind of Shorts Should I Wear Over Bike Shorts?</h2>

If you’re going to wear shorts over bike shorts, it’s important to choose the right kind of shorts. Avoid shorts that are too tight or restrictive, as this can make it difficult to move freely on the bike. Look for shorts that are loose-fitting and lightweight, as these will provide more freedom of movement. 

Cotton shorts are usually a good choice, as they’re lightweight and breathable. However, if you’re riding in the rain, you may want to opt for a more water-resistant fabric such as nylon. 

<h2>Do You Need to Wear Shorts Over Bike Shorts?</h2>

Ultimately, whether or not you choose to wear shorts over bike shorts is up to you. It may be necessary if you’re concerned about modesty or want to stay warm on cold days. However, if you’re comfortable riding in just bike shorts, there’s no need to wear an extra layer.
