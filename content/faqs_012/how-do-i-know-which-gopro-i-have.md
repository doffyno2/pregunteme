<p>Are you looking to find out which GoPro camera you have? It’s a question that many adventurous photographers and videographers have asked themselves at one time or another. Whether you’re about to upgrade your camera or you’re just curious about the model that you have, it’s important to know the exact type of GoPro you own.</p>

<p>With so many different GoPro models available, it can be difficult to keep track of them. Fortunately, it’s easy to determine which GoPro camera you have, and this guide will tell you how. Read on to learn how to identify your specific model and make sure that you’re getting the most out of your GoPro.</p>

<h2>Check Your Box</h2>

<p>The easiest way to determine which GoPro camera you have is to look for the model name on the original box that your GoPro came in. All GoPro cameras have a model number printed on the box, usually in the top right corner. These model numbers are the simplest way to distinguish one GoPro from another.</p>

<p>If you’ve lost or thrown out the box, then you can look for other clues to help you identify your GoPro. The model number is also printed on the bottom of the camera, as well as on the side of the camera’s battery compartment.</p>

<h2>Understand The Model Number</h2>

<p>Once you’ve found the model number, you can use it to look up information about your camera. All GoPro models are identified by a two- or three-digit code. The code consists of a letter followed by two or three numbers. The letter indicates the specific series that your camera belongs to, while the numbers indicate the specific model.</p>

<p>For example, an “SJ4000” model number indicates that the camera is a member of the SJ4000 series. The “4000” portion of the model number indicates that it is the fourth model in the series. This means that the camera is a GoPro SJ4000.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to all GoPro models. You can use the model number to find out which series your camera belongs to, as well as which specific model it is.</p>

<h2>Check The Software</h2>

<p>If you’re still not sure which GoPro camera you have, you can use the camera’s software to find out. All GoPro cameras come with a software package that includes a software version number. This version number indicates which model and series your camera belongs to.</p>

<p>To find out the software version number, turn on your GoPro and navigate to the “Settings” menu. From there, select the “About” option. This will display your GoPro’s software version number, which you can then use to identify your camera.</p>

<h2>Check The Accessories</h2>

<p>Another way to determine which GoPro camera you have is to look at the accessories that came with it. Different models of GoPro come with different accessories, so the accessories can help you identify the specific camera that you own. For example, if your camera came with a waterproof case, then it is most likely a GoPro Hero 4 or later.</p>

<p>You can also use the accessories to find out which series your camera belongs to. For example, if your camera came with a “Floaty Backdoor” accessory, then it is most likely a GoPro Hero 3+ or later.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Knowing which GoPro camera you have is an important part of getting the most out of your camera. By using the model number, software version number, and accessories, it’s easy to identify the exact model that you own and make sure that you’re using the right accessories for your camera.</p>
