Are Umbrella Plants Toxic to Cats and Dogs?

Umbrella plants, or Schefflera arboricola, are popular houseplants for many households. They are easy to care for, attractive and can even help to improve air quality. But are umbrella plants toxic to cats and dogs?

The short answer is yes, umbrella plants are toxic to cats and dogs. All parts of the plant, including the leaves, stems, and fruits, contain toxins that can cause a range of symptoms in cats and dogs if ingested. The most common symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and increased salivation. In more severe cases, the toxins can cause seizures, organ failure, and even death.



Umbrella plants contain an active compound called calcium oxalate, which is a type of toxin found in many other plants. This compound can cause irritation to the mouth, throat, and stomach if ingested by cats and dogs. In more severe cases, the toxins can even cause organ failure and death.



If a pet ingests an umbrella plant, they may experience a range of symptoms. The most common symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and increased salivation. In more severe cases, the toxins can cause seizures and organ failure. If you suspect your pet has ingested an umbrella plant, contact your veterinarian immediately.



The best way to prevent your pet from eating umbrella plants is to keep them out of your pet’s reach. If you have umbrella plants in your home, make sure to keep them in a room or area that is inaccessible to your pet. You should also be sure to monitor your pet when they are in the same room as the umbrella plants.



If you suspect your pet has ingested an umbrella plant, contact your veterinarian immediately. Your veterinarian may recommend that you induce vomiting or give your pet activated charcoal to help absorb the toxins. If the symptoms are severe, your veterinarian may recommend hospitalization and further treatment.
