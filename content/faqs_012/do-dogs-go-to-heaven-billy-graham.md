<p>Do dogs go to heaven? It's a question that has been asked for centuries and is still being asked today. The simple answer is yes, but it's a more complicated answer than a simple yes or no. It's a question that theologian and evangelist Billy Graham discussed in his writings, and his answer is worth exploring. </p>

<h2>What Does the Bible Say About Dogs Going to Heaven?</h2>

<p>The Bible does not specifically mention dogs going to heaven, however, it does provide clues that suggest that animals can go to heaven. In the book of Psalms, it says, “For He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.” This passage implies that God’s angels protect us and our pets, so they can go to heaven with us. </p>

<p>The Bible also tells us that God created the animals and that he loves them. In Genesis, it says, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness...So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them and said to them, ‘Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” This passage shows us that God created animals, and it implies that they have souls that can go to heaven. </p>

<h2>What Does Billy Graham Say About Dogs Going to Heaven?</h2>

God created them and gave them souls, and I believe that when we die, our pets will be there to greet us.” </p>

<p>Graham also notes that there may be another factor at play when it comes to animals going to heaven. He suggests that it may be up to God to decide whether animals can go to heaven, and that it may depend on the individual animal and its purpose in life. He writes, “I believe that animals can go to heaven, but I don’t think they will be judged like humans. I think they will be judged according to their purpose in life and their relationship with their owners.” </p>
