<h2>The Fate of Buck in Call of the Wild</h2>

<p>The novel does not give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not Buck dies in Call of the Wild. In the novel, Buck is taken away from his home in California and sold as a sled dog in Alaska. He then experiences a harsh life in the North, adapting to the conditions and learning the ways of the wild. Eventually, Buck is taken in by John Thornton, who treats him like a pet and offers him a home.
