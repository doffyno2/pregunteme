<p>Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are native to Southeast Asia and are very popular in aquariums around the world. They are known for their bright colors and impressive fins, but one thing that many people don’t know is whether or not betta fish can eat each other. </p>

<p>The answer to this question is both yes and no. Betta fish are omnivorous, which means they will eat both plant and animal matter. This includes other fish, but they usually only consume smaller fish that they can fit in their mouths. So while they may consume other betta fish, it’s not something that they do regularly. </p>

<p>Betta fish are territorial and can become aggressive towards each other. This is especially true with males, as they are particularly territorial and will fight with other males if they come too close. This behavior can lead to injuries and even death, so it’s important to keep only one betta fish in an aquarium. </p>

<p>Betta fish are also known for their cannibalistic behavior. They will often consume their own eggs, and in some cases, they will even consume other betta fish that are weaker or sick. This is why it’s important to keep only one betta fish in an aquarium, as two or more can lead to aggressive behavior and even cannibalism. </p>

<p>In conclusion, betta fish can eat each other, but it’s not something that they do regularly. It’s important to keep only one betta fish in an aquarium, as they can become aggressive towards each other and even consume their own eggs or other weaker fish. </p>
