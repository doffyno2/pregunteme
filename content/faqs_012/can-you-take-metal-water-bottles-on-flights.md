<p>Travelling with a metal water bottle is a great way to stay hydrated while on the go. However, when it comes to flying, the rules on what you can and can’t take with you become a little more complicated. So, can you take metal water bottles on flights?</p>

<p>The answer is yes, but there are a few things to consider. The most important thing to remember is that all liquids must be in containers that are 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or less. If your metal water bottle is larger than this, you will not be allowed to take it on the plane. You will need to empty it and put the liquid in a smaller container before you can take it on the plane.</p>

<p>In addition, you will need to make sure that your metal water bottle is properly sealed. If you are using a reusable water bottle, it should have a screw top lid or another kind of secure lid that won’t leak. If the lid isn’t secure, you won’t be able to take it on the plane.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s important to remember that all liquids must be placed in a clear, sealed, plastic bag. This includes your metal water bottle. Even if it is properly sealed, you will still need to put it in a bag that is clearly marked with the TSA logo.</p>

<p>Overall, you can bring a metal water bottle on a plane, but you will need to make sure that it is 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or less and properly sealed. You will also need to place it in a clear, sealed, plastic bag that is clearly marked with the TSA logo. By following these steps, you can make sure that your metal water bottle is allowed on the plane.</p>
