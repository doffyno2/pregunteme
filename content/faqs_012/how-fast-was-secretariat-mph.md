Born in 1970, Secretariat was a powerful, athletic thoroughbred who won the Triple Crown in 1973.

The question of just how fast Secretariat was is one that is often asked by horse racing enthusiasts, and one that has a definitive answer.

<h2>Secretariat's Record-Breaking Times</h2>

Secretariat was a horse who was bred for speed and power. His sire, Bold Ruler, was a multiple stakes winner and a successful sire, and his dam, Somethingroyal, was also a successful racehorse. Secretariat was trained by Lucien Laurin, and he made his racing debut at Aqueduct Racetrack in 1972. He quickly proved himself to be a formidable competitor, and by the end of the year, he had become the first horse since Citation to win the Triple Crown.

One of Secretariat's most impressive accomplishments was his performance in the 1973 Belmont Stakes. Running against a field of nine other horses, Secretariat won the race by 31 lengths in a time of 2:24, a world record that still stands to this day. This race was the highlight of Secretariat's career and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest horses of all time.
