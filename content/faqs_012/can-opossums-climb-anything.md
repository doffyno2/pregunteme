<p>Opossums are one of the most unique and interesting creatures in the animal kingdom. These small mammals are often seen scurrying across roads at night and have become a familiar sight in many areas of the United States. But can these curious creatures climb anything?</p>

<p>The answer to that question is yes. Opossums are incredibly agile climbers, able to scale walls, fences, trees, and even poles. In fact, they are better climbers than cats and can even climb up drainpipes and electrical wires. They have sharp claws and long tails that act as natural grappling hooks, helping them to cling to surfaces and quickly scurry up them.</p>

<p>It's important to note that opossums are excellent climbers, but they aren't invincible. They can't climb extremely smooth surfaces, such as glass or metal. And if the surface is too steep, they won't be able to climb it either. They also can't jump, so if there's a gap between two objects that is too wide, they won't be able to get across.</p>

<p>Opossums are able to climb a variety of surfaces, including wooden fences, trees, walls, and poles. They use their sharp claws and long tails to help them cling to the surfaces and quickly scurry up them. They aren't able to climb excessively smooth surfaces, such as glass or metal, and if the surface is too steep, they won't be able to climb it either.</p>

<p>Opossums are also excellent tree climbers. They use their sharp claws and long tails to help them cling to the tree and quickly scurry up it. They aren't able to climb excessively smooth surfaces, such as glass or metal, and if the surface is too steep, they won't be able to climb it either.</p>

<p>Opossums are also excellent climbers of man-made structures, such as telephone poles. They have sharp claws and long tails which help them cling to the surface and quickly scurry up them. However, they are unable to climb excessively smooth surfaces, such as glass or metal, and if the surface is too steep, they won't be able to climb it either.</p>

<h2>Do Opossums Climb To Escape Predators?</h2>

<p>Opossums are excellent climbers and are often seen scaling walls and fences in order to escape predators.

If a predator is in pursuit, an opossum may climb a tree, fence, or wall in order to escape.</p>

<p>It's important to note that opossums are not able to climb excessively smooth surfaces, such as glass or metal, and if the surface is too steep, they won't be able to climb it either. However, they are quite adept at climbing other surfaces, such as wooden fences and trees.</p>

<h2>What Other Surfaces Do Opossums Climb?</h2>

<p>In addition to climbing trees, fences, and walls, opossums are also adept at climbing other surfaces. These include drainpipes, electrical wires, and even telephone poles. Their sharp claws and long tails help them cling to the surface and quickly scurry up them.</p>

<h2>Can Opossums Climb Inside Buildings?</h2>

<p>Opossums are excellent climbers, but they cannot climb inside buildings. This is because the walls and ceilings in most buildings are too smooth for them to cling to and climb. However, if there is an opening or gap in the wall, such as a window or door, then an opossum may be able to climb in.</p>
