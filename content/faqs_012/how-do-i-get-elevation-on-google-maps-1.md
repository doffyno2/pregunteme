Google Maps is a powerful and popular mapping tool used by people all over the world. It provides detailed information on locations, directions and the surrounding terrain. One of the many great features of Google Maps is the ability to view elevation information, which can be incredibly useful for a variety of purposes. In this article, we'll explain how to get elevation on Google Maps and what information you can get about the terrain you're viewing.

<h2>What Is Elevation?</h2>

Elevation is the height of land above sea level. It is typically measured in feet or meters, and it can provide valuable insight into the terrain of a given area. Knowing the elevation of a location can help a hiker plan a route, a climber decide where to climb, or someone looking at real estate determine the availability of a particular view. In short, it's a useful bit of information to have when you're exploring a new area.

<h2>What Information Can I Get From Google Maps?</h2>

Google Maps provides a wealth of information about elevation. You can view the elevation at any point along a route, as well as the elevation of the entire route. You can also view elevation profiles which show the change in elevation over a certain distance. Additionally, you can view elevation data for specific points on the map, such as a mountain peak or valley.

<h2>How Do I Get Elevation on Google Maps?</h2>

Getting elevation information from Google Maps is easy. First, open the Google Maps app or go to maps.google.com on your computer. Then zoom in on the area you want to view and click the 'Elevation' button in the top-right corner of the map. A graph will appear showing the elevation profile of the area. You can also click on the map to get the elevation of a specific point.

<h2>How Accurate Is Google Maps Elevation Data?</h2>

Google Maps uses data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which was a joint NASA and USGS mission to map the Earth’s elevation. The data is accurate to within 10 meters, which is generally good enough for most uses. However, if you need more precision, you may want to use other sources of elevation data.

<h2>What Else Can I Do With Google Maps Elevation Data?</h2>

Google Maps elevation data can be used for a variety of purposes, including route planning, outdoor activities, and even real estate. For instance, you can use the elevation data to plan a hiking route that avoids steep slopes or to find a property with a great view. You can also use the data to calculate the total elevation gain and loss of a route, which is helpful for cyclists and hikers.
