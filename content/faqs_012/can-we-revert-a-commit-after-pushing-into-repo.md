Can We Revert a Commit After Pushing Into a Repo?


Pushing a commit to a repository is an important part of the software development process, but sometimes we don’t realize that we’ve made a mistake until after it’s too late. We’ve all been there; you’re in the middle of a project and you make a commit, only to realize after the fact that you’ve made a mistake and need to undo it. Fortunately, there are ways to revert a commit after it has been pushed to a repository. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to do that.

<h2>What Is a Commit?</h2>

Before we dive into the details of how to revert a commit, let’s take a moment to talk about what a commit is. A commit is a snapshot of the state of your code at a particular point in time. A commit is like a checkpoint; it captures the state of your code at a particular moment and allows you to go back to it if you need to.

Commits are usually made when you’ve finished making changes to your code and are ready to push them to a repository. When you make a commit, you specify a message that explains the changes that you’ve made. This message is important because it allows other developers to understand the changes that you’ve made and why.

<h2>Why Would We Need to Revert a Commit?</h2>

There are a few reasons why you might need to revert a commit. The most common is that you’ve made a mistake and need to undo it. Maybe you’ve made a change that you didn’t intend to make, or maybe you’ve introduced a bug into your code and need to undo the commit to fix it.

Another reason to revert a commit is that you need to go back to an earlier version of your code for some reason. Perhaps you need to review an earlier version of your code for a code review, or maybe you need to compare the current version of your code with an earlier version to see what changes have been made.

<h2>How to Revert a Commit After Pushing Into a Repo</h2>

Reverting a commit after it has been pushed to a repo is relatively straightforward. The first step is to get the ID of the commit that you want to revert. You can do this by running the “git log” command. This will list all of the commits that have been made to the repo, along with their IDs. Once you have the ID of the commit that you want to revert, you can use the “git revert” command to revert it.

The “git revert” command takes a few arguments. The first is the commit ID that you want to revert. The second is the message that you want to use for the commit. This should explain why you’re reverting the commit, as it will be visible to other developers.

Once you’ve run the command, the commit will be reverted and the changes will be undone. You can then push the changes to the repo and the commit will be reverted.
