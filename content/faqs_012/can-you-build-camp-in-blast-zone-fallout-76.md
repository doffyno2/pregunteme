<p>Fallout 76 is the latest installment in the Fallout video game series, and it has been met with mixed reviews. Players are able to explore a vast post-apocalyptic world, build their own settlements, and battle against other players. One of the biggest questions many players have is whether or not they can build a camp in areas designated as “blast zones”. This article will answer that question and provide some tips on how to safely construct a camp in these dangerous areas.</p>

<h2>What is a Blast Zone?</h2>

<p>In Fallout 76, a blast zone is an area of the map that has been affected by a nuclear explosion. These zones are highly irradiated and contain numerous enemies. The radiation levels in these zones can be lethal to players, and they should be avoided unless they have the necessary equipment and know-how to traverse them safely.</p>

<h2>Can You Build Camps in Blast Zones?</h2>

Additionally, the camp will require constant maintenance to keep it functional.</p>

<h2>Tips for Building Camps in Blast Zones</h2>

<p>Building a camp in a blast zone can be a dangerous and difficult task, so here are some tips to help you do it safely:</p>
