The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbiting laboratory that has been staffed by humans since 2000. The ISS circles around Earth at a speed of around 17,150 miles per hour (mph). This means that it takes the ISS around 90 minutes to complete one full orbit of the planet.

<h2>What Is the ISS?</h2>

The International Space Station is a modular space station in low Earth orbit. It is the largest artificial body in orbit and can be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS is used as a research laboratory and serves as a platform for conducting experiments in biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and other disciplines. It is also used as a staging area for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

<h2>How Fast Does the ISS Orbit?</h2>

The ISS orbits at an altitude of around 250 miles (400 km) above the Earth's surface. At this altitude, it takes the ISS around 90 minutes to complete one full orbit of the planet. This means that the ISS travels at a speed of around 17,150 mph. This is equivalent to traveling around the Earth more than 15 times in one hour.

<h2>What Is the Maximum Speed of the ISS?</h2>

The ISS can reach a maximum speed of around 17,500 mph. This is the maximum speed that the ISS can reach while orbiting the Earth. However, the ISS can reach much higher speeds when it is traveling to or from other destinations. For example, when the ISS is traveling to the Moon, it can reach a speed of up to 25,000 mph.

<h2>How Is the Speed of the ISS Measured?</h2>

The speed of the ISS is measured using a combination of radar, optical, and other instruments. Radar is used to track the position of the ISS and optical instruments are used to measure the speed of the ISS. This data is then used to calculate the speed of the ISS at any given time.

<h2>How Is the Speed of the ISS Controlled?</h2>

The speed of the ISS is controlled by a combination of thrusters and other engines. Thruster engines are used to control the speed of the ISS and to maneuver it in space. Other engines, such as ion engines, are used to increase the speed of the ISS.

<h2>How Does the Speed of the ISS Affect Its Orbit?</h2>

The speed of the ISS affects its orbit around the Earth. If the ISS is traveling too slowly, it will fall out of orbit and eventually crash into the Earth. On the other hand, if the ISS is traveling too quickly, it will escape the Earth's gravitational pull and drift off into space. As a result, it is important to maintain the ISS at the correct speed so that it can remain in orbit.

<h2>What Is the Average Speed of the ISS?</h2>

The average speed of the ISS is around 17,150 mph. This is the speed at which the ISS orbits the Earth and is the speed that is used most often when discussing the ISS.
