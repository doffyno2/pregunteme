<p>Dogs and humans can share a lot of things, but can they share yogurt? Many people think that because yogurt is a dairy product, it must be bad for their canine friends. However, the truth is that dogs can eat yogurt in moderation. </p> 

<p>In general, yogurt is a safe treat for dogs as long as it does not contain any artificial sweeteners, such as xylitol. Xylitol is toxic to dogs and can cause vomiting, seizures, and even death if consumed in large amounts. So, if you're going to give your pup some yogurt, make sure it is plain and free of any artificial sweeteners.</p>

<p>Yogurt can be beneficial for your pup, as it contains healthy bacteria known as probiotics. Probiotics help to support a healthy digestive tract, which can help your pup to stay healthy and full of energy. Yogurt is also a good source of calcium, which is important for healthy bones and teeth. </p>

<p>When it comes to yogurt for dogs, plain, unsweetened yogurt is best. Flavored yogurts may contain added sugar, which can lead to health issues. Additionally, flavored varieties may contain artificial ingredients that are not good for your pup. </p>

<p>When giving your pup yogurt, make sure that it is plain, unsweetened, and free of any artificial ingredients. Additionally, it’s best to give your pup only small amounts of yogurt at a time, as too much dairy can cause digestive upset. </p>

<p>Yogurt can be a great treat for your pup if it is given in moderation. However, if your pup is lactose intolerant, then it’s best to avoid giving them yogurt altogether. Additionally, consult with your vet before introducing any new foods to your pup’s diet. </p>
