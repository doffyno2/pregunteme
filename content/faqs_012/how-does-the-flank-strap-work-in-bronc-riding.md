Bronc riding is a rodeo event where a rider mounts a wild horse and attempts to stay on for 8 seconds. It is a thrilling and physically demanding sport that requires skill and strength. The flank strap is an essential part of bronc riding, as it helps keep the rider on the horse’s back during the ride. In this article, we’ll take a look at how the flank strap works and why it’s so important. 

<h2>What is a Flank Strap?</h2>

A flank strap is a long strip of leather or nylon webbing that is used in bronc riding. It is typically about two inches wide and is placed around the horse’s girth, just behind the front legs. The strap is secured with a buckle and tightened so that it is snug but not too tight. The flank strap is designed to help the rider stay on the horse’s back during the ride. 

<h2>How Does the Flank Strap Work?</h2>

The flank strap works by providing leverage to the rider. As the horse bucks and kicks, the rider is able to use the strap as a lever to stay in the saddle. The strap also helps to keep the rider’s balance as the horse moves. The flank strap also serves as a cue to the horse, alerting it to the presence of the rider and helping to keep the horse focused on the task at hand.

<h2>Why is the Flank Strap Important?</h2>

The flank strap is an essential part of bronc riding. Without it, the ride would be much more difficult, if not impossible. The strap helps the rider stay in the saddle, as well as providing leverage and balance. It also serves as a cue to keep the horse focused on the task. The flank strap helps to ensure that the ride is safe and successful.

<h2>How Do You Put on a Flank Strap?</h2>

Putting on a flank strap is a relatively simple process. First, the rider must be sure that the saddle is properly fitted to the horse. Once the saddle is in place, the rider should place the flank strap around the horse’s girth, just behind the front legs. The strap should be tightened so that it is snug but not too tight.

<h2>How Do You Care for a Flank Strap?</h2>

Caring for a flank strap is important to ensure that it remains in good condition. The strap should be inspected regularly for signs of wear or damage. It should be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution and allowed to air dry. The strap should also be stored in a cool, dry place when not in use.

<h2>What are the Safety Considerations for Flank Straps?</h2>

Safety is an important consideration when using a flank strap. It is important to ensure that the strap is not too tight, as this could cause discomfort to the horse.
