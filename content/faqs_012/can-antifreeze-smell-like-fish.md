<p>Antifreeze is a chemical that helps to keep cars, trucks, and other vehicles running smoothly during cold winter months. It also prevents the engine from freezing. But, can antifreeze smell like fish? The answer is yes, in some cases, it can.</p>

<p>When antifreeze begins to break down, it can cause a variety of odors, including a fishy smell. This is usually due to the presence of ethylene glycol in the antifreeze. Ethylene glycol is a commonly used antifreeze ingredient and is also used in other industrial applications, including paints and plastic products.</p>

<p>When ethylene glycol breaks down, it releases a variety of chemicals, including ethyl mercaptan. Ethyl mercaptan is what gives antifreeze it's distinctive fishy smell. So, if you're smelling a fishy smell coming from your car, it's possible that it could be a sign that your antifreeze is breaking down.</p>

<p>It's important to note that there are other potential causes of a fishy smell coming from your car. If you're noticing a strong fishy smell coming from your car, it's best to take your car to a qualified mechanic to diagnose and repair the issue. A mechanic will be able to check the antifreeze levels and check for any other potential causes of the smell.</p>

<h2>What Causes Antifreeze to Break Down?</h2>

<p>Antifreeze can break down over time due to a variety of factors, including age, exposure to extreme temperatures, and improper maintenance. As antifreeze ages, it begins to lose its effectiveness, which can lead to it breaking down and releasing ethyl mercaptan. Additionally, if antifreeze is exposed to extreme temperatures, it can begin to break down and release the fishy smell.</p>

<p>Finally, improper maintenance of your car can cause the antifreeze to break down. If you don't change the antifreeze on a regular basis, it can break down and release the fishy smell. Additionally, if your cooling system isn't properly serviced, it can cause the antifreeze to break down and release the fishy smell.</p>

While the fishy smell may be caused by the antifreeze breaking down, it could also be caused by a variety of other issues, including oil leaks, fuel injectors, or a faulty catalytic converter. It's best to have a qualified mechanic diagnose and repair the issue as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>How Can I Prevent My Antifreeze From Breaking Down?</h2>
