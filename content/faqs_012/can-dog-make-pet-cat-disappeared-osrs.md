<p>Owners of cats and dogs can find themselves in a difficult situation when their beloved pets don’t get along. While cats and dogs can often become friends, there are times when their relationship can turn into a heated rivalry. This can be especially true in the world of online gaming, where pets can be used to increase their owner’s chances of success. So, can a dog make a pet cat disappear in OSRS?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is both yes and no. It is certainly possible for a dog to make a pet cat disappear in OSRS, but it is not always a reliable method. In fact, it is quite a risky maneuver and one that should only be attempted by experienced players. Here, we will explain how dogs can make pet cats disappear in OSRS and what risks are involved.</p>

<h2>How Dogs Can Make Pet Cats Disappear OSRS</h2>

<p>The process is actually quite simple. All that is required is for the player to have a pet dog and for the pet cat to be within the same area. Once this is done, the player must then use the “follow me” command on the dog. This will cause the pet cat to follow the dog, and if the dog is able to lead the cat far enough away from their owner, the cat will eventually disappear.</p>

<p>However, this is far from a sure-fire method. The cat may simply run away from the dog, or the dog may not be able to lead the cat far enough away before the cat is recalled by its owner. If the cat is still within the same area as the player, it will simply teleport back to its owner and will not disappear. Additionally, it is important to note that this method only works with pet cats, as non-player cats cannot be teleported.</p>

<h2>Risks Involved in Making Pet Cats Disappear OSRS</h2>

<p>The biggest risk associated with making pet cats disappear in OSRS is that it can be seen as a form of pet abuse. While it is not illegal, players who are caught doing this may experience negative repercussions within the game. Additionally, it is important to note that the pet cat may become agitated or even hostile if it is forced to follow the dog for too long. This could lead to a dangerous situation and should be avoided.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that not all pet cats can be made to disappear in OSRS. Some cats are more likely to follow the dog than others, and this is something that players should keep in mind when attempting this method. Additionally, it is also important to remember that the cat may become lost and may never be found again if it is led too far away from its owner.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In short, it is possible for a dog to make a pet cat disappear in OSRS, but it is a risky maneuver that should only be attempted by experienced players. Not all pet cats can be made to disappear, and the pet cat may become hostile or lost if it is led too far away from its owner. It is also important to remember that this method may be seen as a form of pet abuse, so players should use it responsibly.</p>
