The body of the galaxy rasbora is elongated and slender, with a black, star-shaped marking on its back and sides.

Galaxy rasboras are found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshes in Southeast Asia. They are found throughout Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. They are also found in the Philippines and Singapore, but they are not as commonly seen there.



Galaxy rasboras are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. They will eat a variety of small insects, worms, crustaceans, and other small aquatic invertebrates. They also feed on algae and small bits of vegetable matter. In the aquarium, they should be fed a variety of foods, including live and frozen foods as well as high-quality flake and pellet foods.



Galaxy rasboras are fairly hardy fish and can adapt to a range of water conditions. An aquarium of at least 10 gallons is recommended for a group of six to eight galaxy rasboras. The water should be kept between 72°F and 82°F with a pH of 6.0 to 8.0. The tank should be heavily planted with plenty of hiding places for the fish to feel secure.



Galaxy rasboras are peaceful fish that do best when kept in groups. A group of six to eight is ideal, as they will be more active and social when kept in larger groups. They can be kept with other peaceful fish such as tetras, barbs, danios, and gouramis. It is important to avoid aggressive or territorial fish, as the galaxy rasboras may be intimidated or harassed.



Breeding galaxy rasboras is not difficult, but it does require some patience and dedication. The tank should be set up with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5 and a temperature between 78°F and 82°F. The tank should also be heavily planted with plenty of hiding places. The male and female galaxy rasboras should be conditioned with live and frozen foods before breeding.

The eggs will hatch in two to three days and the fry will be free-swimming a few days later. The fry should be fed finely crushed flake food and live food such as baby brine shrimp.
