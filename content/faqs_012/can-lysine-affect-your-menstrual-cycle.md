<p>Menstrual cycles are a normal and important part of a woman's life, and understanding how they work is an important part of maintaining good health. For those who are looking for ways to help regulate their menstrual cycles, lysine may be a promising supplement. But what is lysine and can it really affect your menstrual cycle?</p>

<h2>What is Lysine?</h2>

<p>Lysine is an essential amino acid, which means it's one of the amino acids our bodies cannot produce on their own. It must be consumed through diet or supplements. Lysine is found in high-protein foods like eggs, fish, red meat, beans, and dairy products. It plays a role in the production of enzymes and hormones, as well as helping to maintain a healthy gut and immune system.</p>

It can also help reduce the intensity of PMS symptoms, including cramps and bloating. Additionally, lysine can help with premenstrual cravings and mood swings.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that lysine can help improve fertility. One study found that women who took lysine supplements had higher levels of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. These hormones are important for ovulation, which is necessary for fertility. Lysine has also been shown to help with infertility caused by polycystic ovary syndrome.</p>
