<p>Casting When Damage Taken (or CWDT) is an incredibly powerful defensive tool in Path of Exile. It allows you to cast several spells, such as Immortal Call, Enfeeble, and Tempest Shield, when you take a certain amount of damage. This gives you an extra layer of protection, allowing you to survive otherwise deadly situations. In this article, we’ll discuss how to set up your CWDT, what spells to use, and how to get the most out of it.</p>

<h2>How to Set Up CWDT</h2>

<p>Setting up CWDT is fairly simple. All you need to do is place the CWDT gem in your socketed gear, link it to the spells you want to use, and adjust the damage threshold. You can also link multiple CWDT gems together to cast multiple spells at different damage thresholds.</p>

<p>First, find an item with a socketed gem slot. Most helmets, body armours, and shields will have a few, but you can also find them on gloves and boots. Place the CWDT gem in an open socket, and link it to the spells you want to cast. Make sure to use the highest level CWDT gem you can find, as this will increase the damage threshold.</p>

<p>Once you’ve linked the CWDT gem to the spells you want to use, you need to adjust the damage threshold. To do this, simply right-click on the CWDT gem and select “Configure”. This will bring up a menu where you can adjust the damage threshold. We recommend setting the threshold to 40% of your maximum life, but you can adjust it to whatever you feel comfortable with.</p>

<h2>What Spells to Use with CWDT</h2>

<p>The spells you choose to use with CWDT will depend on your build and playstyle. Generally speaking, it’s best to use defensive spells such as Immortal Call, Enfeeble, and Tempest Shield. These spells will help you survive otherwise deadly situations, giving you a much-needed edge in combat.</p>

<p>If you’re playing a tanky build, you may want to use a combination of Immortal Call, Enfeeble, and Tempest Shield. Immortal Call will reduce the damage you take from physical attacks, Enfeeble will reduce the damage you take from spells, and Tempest Shield will give you bonus block chance and absorb incoming damage.</p>

<p>If you’re playing a more offensive build, you may want to use a combination of Immortal Call, Arctic Armour, and Vaal Haste. Immortal Call will reduce the damage you take from physical attacks, Arctic Armour will give you bonus physical damage reduction, and Vaal Haste will increase your attack and cast speed.</p>

<p>In addition to these spells, you may also want to use a spell such as Molten Shell or Phase Run. Molten Shell will give you bonus armour and fire resistance, while Phase Run will increase your movement speed and grant you bonus evasion.</p>

<h2>Getting the Most Out of CWDT</h2>

<p>Once you’ve set up your CWDT, there are a few tips and tricks you can use to get the most out of it. Firstly, make sure to use the highest level CWDT gem you can find. This will increase the damage threshold and make it more effective. Secondly, make sure to link your CWDT gem to spells that are appropriate for your build and playstyle. Lastly, make sure to adjust the damage threshold to a level that makes you feel comfortable.</p>

<p>Casting When Damage Taken is an incredibly powerful defensive tool that can give you an edge in combat. By setting it up properly and using the right spells, you can make sure that you’re always prepared for the worst.
