<h2>How Long Does It Take to Gain 1 Pound?</h2>

Generally speaking, gaining one pound of body weight can take anywhere from a few days to several months. If you’re trying to gain weight in a healthy and safe way, it’s best to gain it gradually, rather than trying to gain it all at once.</p>

<h3>Factors Affecting How Quickly You Gain Weight</h3>
