<p>The Fitbit is a popular fitness tracker that helps you keep track of your daily physical activities. It is a great resource for anyone who wants to stay on track of their fitness goals. But, one of the biggest questions many people have about the Fitbit is how accurate is its calorie counter? We’ll take a look at what the Fitbit calorie counter is, how it works, and how accurate it is in this article.</p>

<p>The Fitbit calorie counter is a feature of the Fitbit fitness tracker that tracks how many calories you burn throughout the day and night. The calorie counter is based on your activity levels, heart rate, and other factors to give you an estimate of how many calories you've burned. It also includes a “body fat percentage” estimate and a “resting metabolic rate” estimate.</p>

<h2>How Does the Fitbit Calorie Counter Work?</h2>
