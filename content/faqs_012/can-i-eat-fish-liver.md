<p>Fish liver is a type of food that contains a lot of beneficial nutrients, but it can also be dangerous if eaten in large amounts. Eating fish liver can be beneficial to your health if you are aware of the potential risks and how to enjoy the food safely. In this article, we will discuss the potential health benefits of eating fish liver, as well as the potential risks.</p> 

<h2>The Potential Benefits of Eating Fish Liver</h2>

<p>Fish liver is a great source of nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin D, and selenium. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for cardiovascular health, maintaining healthy cholesterol levels, and reducing inflammation. Vitamin A helps maintain healthy eyesight, while vitamin D helps strengthen bones and teeth. Selenium is an antioxidant that helps protect the body from oxidative damage.</p>

<p>Fish liver is also a great source of protein. It contains all the essential amino acids that the body needs for muscle growth and repair. Eating fish liver can also help you to feel full for longer, which can be beneficial if you are trying to lose weight.</p>

<h2>The Potential Risks of Eating Fish Liver</h2>

<p>Although fish liver is a great source of nutrients, it can also be dangerous if eaten in large amounts. Eating too much fish liver can cause a condition known as hypervitaminosis A, which is an overdose of vitamin A. Symptoms of hypervitaminosis A include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headaches.</p>
