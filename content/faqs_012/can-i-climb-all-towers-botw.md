Once activated, players can then climb the tower using their stamina to reach the top and gain a better view of the area.

<h2>Are All Towers Climbable?</h2>

Unfortunately, not all of the towers in Breath of the Wild are climbable. Some towers are blocked off by an invisible barrier that prevents players from reaching the top. These towers are usually found in areas with restricted access, such as Hyrule Castle, or areas that require a specific item or ability to access, such as the Divine Beasts.

<h2>Which Towers Can I Climb?</h2>

Players can climb any of the towers that are not blocked off by an invisible barrier. These towers can be found in the various regions of Hyrule, such as the Great Plateau, the East Necluda region, and the Akkala region.
