<p>Tricare is a health care program provided by the United States Department of Defense for active duty and retired military members and their families. It provides comprehensive medical coverage for most medical procedures, including post-operative cataract surgery. However, there are some limitations and restrictions that may apply when it comes to Tricare coverage for postop cataract surgery.</p>

<h2>What Is Cataract Surgery?</h2>

<p>Cataract surgery is a surgical procedure performed to remove the natural lens of the eye, which has become clouded or opaque due to age or injury. The replacement lens is a synthetic, artificial lens called an intraocular lens (IOL). This lens is inserted in the eye during the procedure and is designed to restore vision.</p>

<h2>What Is Covered Under Tricare?</h2>

<p>Tricare covers medically necessary cataract surgery, including preoperative and postoperative care. However, there are several restrictions and limits to what is covered. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tricare covers the cost of the surgery, but the patient is responsible for any co-payments or deductibles.</li>
  <li>Tricare does not cover the cost of the IOL. The patient must pay for this out-of-pocket.</li>
  <li>Tricare does not cover the cost of any additional treatments or procedures, such as laser vision correction.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important to note that Tricare does not cover any pre-existing conditions that may be related to the cataract surgery. For example, if the patient has an existing condition that has caused the cataracts to form, such as diabetes, Tricare will not cover the cost of the surgery.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Other Restrictions?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are some additional restrictions that may apply when it comes to Tricare coverage for postop cataract surgery. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tricare will only cover the cost of the procedure if it is deemed medically necessary by a doctor.</li>
  <li>Tricare will only cover the cost of the procedure if it is performed in a Tricare-approved facility.</li>
  <li>Tricare will only cover the cost of the procedure if it is performed by a Tricare-approved physician.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that Tricare may not cover the entire cost of the procedure, depending on the individual's coverage plan. For example, some plans may have a deductible or co-payment that must be paid before the procedure is covered.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Exceptions?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are some exceptions to the Tricare coverage for postop cataract surgery. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tricare will cover the cost of the procedure if it is necessary to restore vision due to an injury or illness.</li>
  <li>Tricare will cover the cost of the procedure if it is necessary to improve vision due to an eye disease.</li>
  <li>Tricare will cover the cost of the procedure if it is necessary to prevent vision loss due to an eye disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that Tricare may not cover the entire cost of the procedure, depending on the individual's coverage plan. For example, some plans may have a deductible or co-payment that must be paid before the procedure is covered.</p>

<h2>What Is The Process For Obtaining Tricare Coverage?</h2>

<p>In order to obtain Tricare coverage for postop cataract surgery, the patient must first obtain a referral from their primary care doctor. The referral must be for a Tricare-approved physician who is authorized to perform the procedure. The patient must then contact the Tricare-approved physician to schedule an appointment.

If the procedure is deemed medically necessary, the patient will be referred to a Tricare-approved facility for the procedure.</p>

<h2>What Is The Cost Of Postop Cataract Surgery?</h2>
