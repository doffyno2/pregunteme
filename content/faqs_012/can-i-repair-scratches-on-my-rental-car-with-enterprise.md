<p>If you’ve ever rented a car, you know that scratches and dings can easily occur during the course of your rental. Whether it’s a tiny scrape or a major dent, you may be wondering if you can repair the damage yourself or if you’ll be liable for the cost. If you’re renting from Enterprise, the answer isn’t as simple as you might think. Read on to learn the details of Enterprise’s policy on rental car damage.</p>

<h2>What Types of Damage Does Enterprise Cover?</h2>

<p>Enterprise’s policy does cover certain types of damage, but it also depends on the type of rental agreement you have. If you’re renting under the company’s traditional rental program, Enterprise will cover damage from weather, vandalism, theft, collision, and tire and glass damage. This coverage does not include damage from improper use of the vehicle, such as off-roading or reckless driving.</p>

<p>However, if you’re renting under the company’s rental agreement, Enterprise will not cover any damage to the vehicle. This means you will be liable for any scratches, dents, or other damage that occurs while the car is in your possession. This includes scratches that you cause while parking or backing out of a tight space.</p>

<h2>What Is the Process for Repairing Damage?</h2>

<p>If you cause damage to a rental car while it is in your possession, you have several options for repair. You can either take the car to an Enterprise-approved repair shop or you can choose to repair the damage yourself. If you choose to repair the damage yourself, you must use an authorized repair shop and submit a receipt for the repair to Enterprise. However, if you choose to repair the damage yourself, you must first obtain authorization from Enterprise.</p>

<p>If you choose to take the car to an Enterprise-approved repair shop, the cost of the repair will be billed to you. The repair shop will provide you with a receipt for the repair, which you can submit to Enterprise. Enterprise will then process the claim and reimburse you for the cost of the repair.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Additional Fees for Damage?</h2>

<p>In addition to the cost of the repair, Enterprise may also charge an administrative fee for processing the claim. This fee will vary depending on the type of damage and the cost of the repair. Additionally, there may be additional fees for rental car insurance, which is required in some states.</p>

<h2>Is It Possible to Avoid Damage Charges?</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid damage charges is to be careful when driving the rental car. Always make sure you park carefully and take extra precautions when backing out of tight spaces. Additionally, if you’re renting under the traditional rental program, be sure to purchase adequate rental car insurance to cover any potential damage. This will ensure that you’re not liable for any repair costs if damage does occur.</p>
