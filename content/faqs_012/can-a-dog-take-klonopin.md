<p>Klonopin, also known as clonazepam, is a benzodiazepine medication that is commonly prescribed to treat panic attacks, seizures, and other forms of anxiety disorders.

<p>In rare cases, Klonopin can cause more severe side effects such as depression, aggression, and seizures. It is important to contact a veterinarian immediately if your dog experiences any of these symptoms. </p>
