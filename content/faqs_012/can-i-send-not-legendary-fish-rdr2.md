<p>RDR2, or Red Dead Redemption 2, is an epic open-world video game developed by Rockstar Games. It is the highly anticipated sequel to the original Red Dead Redemption and is set in the American Wild West of 1899. It has been praised for its expansive world and its attention to detail, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. As such, fans of the game have been eager to explore its expansive world and take part in its various activities.</p>

<p>One of the activities available in the game is fishing. Fishing is a great way to relax and explore the world of RDR2, and it can also be a great way to make money. While fishing, you can encounter many different types of fish, some of which are considered legendary. These legendary fish can be sold for a high price, making them a great way to make money in the game. But can you send non-legendary fish in RDR2?</p>

<h2>What Are Non-Legendary Fish?</h2>

<p>Non-legendary fish are fish that can be found in the game but are not considered legendary. They are typically smaller than the legendary fish, and they are usually worth less money when sold. These fish can still be caught and sold in the game, but they will not fetch as high a price as the legendary fish. Non-legendary fish can be found in various locations throughout the game, including lakes, rivers, and even the ocean.</p>

<h2>Can I Send Non-Legendary Fish in RDR2?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, you cannot send non-legendary fish in RDR2. The only way to send fish in the game is to send a legendary fish. This means that if you are looking to make money off of your fishing exploits, you will need to focus on catching legendary fish. The game does offer a few ways to increase your chances of finding legendary fish, such as using lures and bait, and exploring different areas of the map.</p>

<h2>How Can I Make Money From Fishing?</h2>

However, you can still make money from catching non-legendary fish. The key is to sell them in bulk. You can sell multiple non-legendary fish for more money than you would get from selling just one. You can also try to find fish that are worth more money, such as rare species or fish that are larger than average.</p>

<h2>What Are the Best Locations for Fishing?</h2>

<p>The best locations for fishing vary depending on what type of fish you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for legendary fish, then you should focus on exploring the deeper waters of the map.
