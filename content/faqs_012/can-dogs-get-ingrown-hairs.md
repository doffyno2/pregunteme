<p>Dogs are furry creatures that are loved and enjoyed by many people around the world. But as with any pet, they can also be prone to certain health problems. One such problem is the occurrence of ingrown hairs, which can be a source of discomfort for your pup. So, can dogs get ingrown hairs? </p>

<p>In short, yes. Dogs can and do get ingrown hairs. Just like humans, the hair follicles on a dog’s skin can become blocked, preventing the hair from growing out. This can cause the hair to curl back into the skin, leading to irritation, discomfort and even infection. </p>

<p>Ingrown hairs in dogs are caused by a variety of factors. The most common are: </p>
