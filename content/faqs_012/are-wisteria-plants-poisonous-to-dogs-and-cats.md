Wisteria is a beautiful flowering plant that is often grown as an ornamental in gardens around the world. It is an attractive choice for gardeners looking to add a touch of color and texture to their outdoor spaces. But while wisteria is a popular choice for a number of reasons, it is important to note that it can be toxic to both dogs and cats if they ingest it. Therefore, pet owners need to be aware of the risks associated with wisteria and take steps to ensure the safety of their furry friends.

<h2>What is Wisteria?</h2>

Wisteria is a type of flowering vine that belongs to the Fabaceae family. It is native to China, Japan, and the eastern United States and grows best in moist, well-drained soil. Wisteria is known for its fragrant, lilac-colored flowers which bloom in the spring and summer. It can grow to be quite large, reaching up to 30 feet in height, and requires pruning to keep it manageable.

<h2>How to Prevent Your Pet from Ingesting Wisteria</h2>

If your pet does ingest wisteria, contact your veterinarian immediately for advice.

<h2>What to Do if Your Pet Ingests Wisteria</h2>
