Hydrangea bushes are beloved for their beautiful blooms, but many gardeners are hesitant to bring them into their yards because of their reputation for requiring a lot of maintenance. Hydrangeas can be high-maintenance, depending on the type, but there are also varieties that are low maintenance and easy to care for. In this article, we'll go over what to look for when shopping for a low-maintenance hydrangea bush, as well as the basics of how to care for them. 

<h2>Types of Hydrangeas</h2>

There are several types of hydrangeas, and it's important to understand the difference between them so you can choose the right one for your garden. The most common types of hydrangeas are the mophead and the lacecap. Mophead hydrangeas are the ones most people think of when they hear the word hydrangea, with their large, round blooms. Lacecap hydrangeas have much smaller blooms, but they are still beautiful. 

<h2>Low-Maintenance Hydrangeas</h2>

Mophead and lacecap hydrangeas can be high-maintenance and require a lot of pruning and care, but there are also low-maintenance varieties. The Oakleaf Hydrangea is a good choice if you're looking for a low-maintenance plant. It is hardy and drought-tolerant, and it only needs minimal pruning. It also has large, showy blooms that can be pink, white, or blue depending on the soil pH. 

<h2>Pruning and Care</h2>

Hydrangeas can be prone to disease and infestations, so it's important to inspect them regularly for any signs of trouble. Prune them in late winter or early spring to keep them healthy and encourage more blooms. If you are pruning to shape the plant, make sure to leave some of the old wood as this is where the blooms will form. 

<h2>Watering and Fertilizing</h2>

Hydrangeas need plenty of water, especially during the summer months. Make sure to water them at least once a week, and more often in hot weather. They also benefit from a fertilizer applied once a year in the spring.
