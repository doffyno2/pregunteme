The CDL is issued by the state in which you reside and is recognized throughout the United States. In order to obtain a CDL, you must pass a test that covers topics such as driving laws, vehicle maintenance, and road safety. If you do not have a CDL and are caught driving a commercial vehicle without one, you could face hefty fines and possible jail time.  </p>

<h2>Do You Need a CDL for a 5th Wheel Camper?</h2>

<h2>How to Determine the Weight of a 5th Wheel Camper</h2>
