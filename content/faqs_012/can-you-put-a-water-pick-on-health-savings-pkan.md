<p>A water pick is an oral hygiene device used to clean the teeth and gums. It uses a stream of water to remove plaque and food particles from in between the teeth and underneath the gum line. Many people find that using a water pick is more effective than brushing and flossing alone. But can you use a water pick on a health savings plan?</p>

<h2>What is a Health Savings Plan?</h2>

<p>A health savings plan is a type of health insurance plan that allows individuals and families to save money on medical costs. These plans are designed to provide coverage for high-deductible health plans. The money saved in a health savings plan can be used to pay for deductibles, co-pays, and other health-related expenses, such as vision and dental care. </p>

<h2>Can You Use a Water Pick on a Health Savings Plan?</h2>

<p>The answer is yes. A water pick can be used as an eligible medical expense on a health savings plan. Eligible medical expenses are those that are necessary to treat or prevent illness or injury, and that are approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A water pick falls into this category, as it is used to prevent gum disease and other dental problems. </p>

<h2>Does Insurance Cover the Cost of a Water Pick?</h2>

<p>Whether or not insurance will cover the cost of a water pick will depend on your specific plan. Some plans may cover the cost of a water pick, while others may not. It is important to check with your insurance provider to determine if your plan covers the cost of a water pick. </p>

<h2>Can You Use a Water Pick on a Flexible Spending Account?</h2>

<p>A flexible spending account (FSA) is a type of health savings plan that allows individuals to set aside money from their paycheck to help cover medical expenses. Like a health savings plan, a FSA can be used to pay for eligible medical expenses, such as a water pick. However, it is important to note that FSA funds must be used within a certain period of time, so it is important to plan ahead when using a FSA to pay for a water pick. </p>

<h2>Are There Other Ways to Pay for a Water Pick?</h2>

<p>If you do not have a health savings plan or a FSA, there are other ways to pay for a water pick. Many dentists offer payment plans and financing options, so it is possible to purchase a water pick and pay for it over time. Additionally, some manufacturers offer discounts and promotions, so it is always worth checking to see if a water pick is on sale. </p>
