<p>Cortizone 10 is a topical cream that is used to treat a variety of skin conditions, including rashes, eczema, allergies, and insect bites. It is also used to reduce swelling and inflammation, making it a popular choice for treating skin irritations in both humans and animals. But can it be used on dogs ears? </p>

<p>The answer is yes, but only under the guidance of a veterinarian. Cortizone 10 is not recommended for use on any area of the body without the approval of a qualified veterinarian. This is because Cortizone 10 can be toxic if used in excessive amounts, and can cause side effects such as dryness, irritation, and redness. It is also important to note that Cortizone 10 should never be used in the ear canal of a dog, as it can cause serious damage to the delicate inner ear. </p>

<p>If your dog is suffering from an ear infection or irritation of the ear, then your veterinarian may recommend the use of Cortizone 10. When used correctly, Cortizone 10 can help to reduce inflammation, reduce itching, and reduce the pain associated with ear infections.
