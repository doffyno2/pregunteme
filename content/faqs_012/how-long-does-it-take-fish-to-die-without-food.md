<p>Fish are one of the most commonly kept pets around the world, but one of the most common questions asked about them is how long do they survive without food? While the answer to this question will vary depending on the species of fish and the environment they are in, there are some general guidelines that can help answer this question.</p>

<h2>Factors That Affect Fish Survival Without Food</h2>

<p>There are several factors that can affect how long a fish can live without food. These include the species of fish, the size of the fish, the water temperature, and the quality of the water. A fish's ability to survive without food also depends on their natural environment. Some fish are more tolerant to extreme conditions than others.</p>

<h2>Typical Survival Times for Fish Without Food</h2>

<p>In general, most fish can survive without food for up to two weeks. However, some species of fish are able to survive for longer periods of time without food. For example, some species of salmon can go up to three weeks without food. Other species of fish, such as koi, can survive up to four weeks without food.</p>

<h2>The Impact of Temperature on Fish Survival</h2>

<p>The temperature of the water can also have an impact on how long a fish can survive without food.
