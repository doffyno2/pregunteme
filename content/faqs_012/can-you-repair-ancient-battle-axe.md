<h2>What to Look for When Repairing an Ancient Battle Axe</h2>

<p>When repairing an ancient battle axe, it’s important to look for signs of wear and tear. Look for cracks, splits, or chips in the blade.

If the handle is too damaged to be repaired, you may need to have it replaced.</p>

<p>Another thing to look for when repairing an ancient battle axe is corrosion. Corrosion can be caused by humidity, saltwater, or other environmental factors. If the axe is corroded, it may need to be sanded down and then treated with a protective coating. This will help protect it from further damage.</p>
