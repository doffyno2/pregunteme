<p>If you’re a fan of NBA2K, you’ve no doubt heard about the new game, NBA2K20. It’s the latest installment of the hugely popular video game series, and it’s packed with new features and exciting game modes. But one of the most important questions that players have is: Does my rep carry over 2K20? The answer is yes, and here’s why.</p>

<h2>What is Rep?</h2>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of rep, it’s the in-game currency that players can earn by playing the game. As you play, you’ll accumulate rep points, which can be used to purchase in-game items and upgrades. Rep is also used to rank players on the leaderboards, and it’s a great way to show off your skills and show that you’re a top-tier player.</p>

<h2>Why Does My Rep Carry Over 2K20?</h2>

<p>The answer is simple: your rep carries over from game to game because it’s tied to your in-game account. When you create your account, it’s tied to your rep, so no matter which game you play, your rep remains intact. This means that if you’re a high-level player in NBA2K19, your rep will carry over when you switch to NBA2K20, and you’ll be able to show off your skills in the new game right away.</p>

<h2>What Else is Carried Over?</h2>

<p>In addition to your rep, many other items and upgrades are carried over when you switch to a new game. This includes your badges, your MyPlayer items, and your MyTeam items. All of these items and upgrades will remain in your account when you switch to NBA2K20, so you won’t have to start from scratch.</p>

<h2>What About My VC?</h2>

<p>VC, or virtual currency, is also carried over from game to game. When you switch to NBA2K20, any VC that you had in NBA2K19 will be carried over, so you won’t have to worry about starting from scratch. VC is an important part of the game, as it allows you to purchase in-game items and upgrades, so it’s nice to know that your VC will remain intact when you switch games.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you’re a fan of NBA2K and you’re wondering if your rep will carry over when you switch to NBA2K20, the answer is yes. Your rep, badges, MyPlayer items, MyTeam items, and VC will all be carried over when you switch games, so you won’t have to start from scratch. So if you’re a high-level player in NBA2K19, you can rest assured that your rep will carry over when you switch to NBA2K20.</p>
