<p>Many people have heard that grapes and raisins are toxic to dogs, and that grape stems can be even worse. But is that really true? Do grape stems really pose a threat to our canine friends?</p>

<p>The answer is yes and no. While it is true that grapes and raisins can be toxic to dogs, the amount of toxicity in the stem is not as high as in the actual fruit. This means that while eating a few grape stems is unlikely to cause any serious harm to your dog, it is still best to avoid it altogether.</p>

<p>Grapes and raisins contain compounds called furanocoumarins, which are naturally occurring chemicals found in some plants. These chemicals can be toxic to dogs when eaten in large enough quantities. The concentration of these compounds is much higher in the actual fruit than it is in the stems, so eating a few grape stems is unlikely to cause any harm.</p> 

<p>However, it is still best to avoid giving your dog any grape stems at all. For one thing, there is still a chance that your dog could have an adverse reaction to even a small amount of these chemicals. In addition, grape stems can be a choking hazard, as they can easily get stuck in your dog’s throat. It is also worth noting that grape stems can contain small amounts of pesticide residue, which can be harmful to your dog.</p>
