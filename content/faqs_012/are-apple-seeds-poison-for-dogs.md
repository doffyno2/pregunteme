Are Apple Seeds Poison for Dogs?



As pet owners, we all love to give our furry friends treats from time to time. Apples are a popular snack for many four-legged friends, but it's important to remember that apples come with a warning: apple seeds are poisonous to dogs. While the flesh of the apple is safe for your pup, the seeds contain a compound called amygdalin, which can be toxic to your canine companion.

<h2>What is Amygdalin?</h2>

Amygdalin is a compound found in apple seeds and certain other fruits and vegetables. It is also known as laetrile, or vitamin B17. Amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside, which means it can produce cyanide when it comes into contact with digestive enzymes in the stomach. Cyanide is a poison that is toxic to cells, and can be deadly if ingested in large amounts. 

<h2>How Much Apple Seed is Poisonous for Dogs?</h2>

The amount of amygdalin in apple seeds is small, and it would take a large amount to produce enough cyanide to be toxic. That said, it's best to keep apples and their seeds away from your pet. If your dog does ingest apple seeds, it is important to pay attention to their behavior. If your dog becomes lethargic, experiences vomiting or diarrhea, or has difficulty breathing, these may be signs of poisoning and you should contact your veterinarian right away.

<h2>Are Other Fruits and Vegetables Safe?</h2>

Amygdalin is also found in other fruits and vegetables, including apricots, peaches, cherries, and almonds. While these foods may also contain small amounts of the compound, it would take an extremely large amount to cause toxicity. However, as with apples, it is best to keep these foods away from your pet. 

<h2>What Should I Do if My Dog Eats Apple Seeds?</h2>

If your dog does ingest apple seeds, it is important to pay attention to their behavior. If your dog becomes lethargic, experiences vomiting or diarrhea, or has difficulty breathing, these may be signs of poisoning and you should contact your veterinarian right away. 

<h2>Can Dogs Eat Apples Without the Seeds?</h2>

Yes, dogs can safely eat apples without the seeds. Apples are a great source of vitamins and minerals, and can be a healthy treat for your pup. It is important to remember to remove the seeds before giving your dog an apple, as the seeds can be dangerous.
