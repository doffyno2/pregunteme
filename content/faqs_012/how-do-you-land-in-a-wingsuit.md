<p>If you’re looking for a thrilling way to experience the sky, wingsuit flying may be the perfect activity for you. As with any extreme sport, it’s important to always take safety precautions before taking flight. Learn the basics of wingsuit flying and how to safely land in a wingsuit before you take off. </p>

<h2>What is a Wingsuit?</h2>

<p>A wingsuit is a specialized suit that includes fabric wings between the arms and legs. It’s designed to help the wearer achieve long, sustained flights in the air, usually during skydiving. This type of suit has been used in extreme sports for decades, but it has become increasingly popular in recent years.</p>

<h2>How Does a Wingsuit Work?</h2>

The fabric wings also help to increase the surface area of the body, which helps to reduce the rate of descent. These factors allow the wearer to fly in a more controlled manner, allowing for longer and more sustained flights.</p>
