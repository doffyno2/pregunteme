Frying frozen fish is a popular way to cook a variety of fish dishes, from traditional fish and chips to more exotic fare. But how long does it take to deep fry frozen fish? The answer depends on several factors, including the type of fish, the size of the fish fillets, and the temperature of the oil. In this article, we'll take a look at all the factors that need to be considered when deep frying frozen fish. 

<h2>Types of Fish</h2>

The type of fish you are frying is an important factor when determining how long to deep fry frozen fish. Some types of fish, such as tilapia and cod, are much thinner than others and will cook much faster. On the other hand, thicker fish such as salmon and halibut will take longer to cook. 

<h2>Size of Fish Fillets</h2>

The size of the fish fillets also affects how long it takes to deep fry frozen fish. Smaller fillets will cook faster than larger ones, so it is important to take this into consideration when timing the frying process. 

<h2>Temperature of Oil</h2>

The temperature of the oil is also an important factor when deep frying frozen fish. If the oil is too hot, the outside of the fish will cook too quickly and the inside will remain raw. On the other hand, if the oil is too cool, the fish will take too long to cook and will end up overcooked. For optimal results, the oil should be heated to 375°F (190°C).

<h2>Frying Time</h2>

Once all the factors have been taken into consideration, the actual frying time will vary depending on the type and size of fish fillets. Generally speaking, thin fillets such as tilapia and cod will take about 3-4 minutes to cook, while thicker fillets such as salmon and halibut will take 5-7 minutes. It is important to keep an eye on the frying process and remove the fish from the oil once it is cooked through.
