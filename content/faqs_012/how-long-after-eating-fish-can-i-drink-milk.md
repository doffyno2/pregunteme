<p>Many people are unsure about how long after eating fish they can safely drink milk. This is not an uncommon question, as there are certain types of fish that can cause allergic reactions when combined with dairy. The good news is that, in most cases, it is perfectly safe to drink milk after eating fish.</p>

<p>The key to knowing how long after eating fish you can safely drink milk is to be aware of the type of fish you have eaten. Some types of fish contain high levels of histamine, which can trigger an allergic reaction when combined with dairy. Additionally, some types of fish contain the enzyme trypsin, which can also cause an allergic reaction if combined with dairy.</p>

<h2>Types of Fish That Can React With Dairy</h2>

<p>Fish such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, sardines, and herring contain high levels of histamine, which can cause an allergic reaction if combined with dairy. These types of fish can also contain the enzyme trypsin, which can also cause an allergic reaction when combined with dairy. It is important to note that not all fish contain these compounds, and some fish, such as cod and haddock, are considered safe to combine with dairy.</p>

<h2>How Long After Eating Fish Can You Drink Milk?</h2>

<p>The general rule of thumb is to wait at least two hours after eating fish before drinking milk. This will give the body enough time to break down the histamine and trypsin, which can trigger an allergic reaction when combined with dairy. It is also important to note that some people may be more sensitive to histamine and trypsin than others, so it is best to wait a few hours after eating fish before drinking milk.</p>

<h2>Can You Have Dairy With Cooked Fish?</h2>

<p>In general, it is safe to have dairy with cooked fish. Most of the histamine and trypsin are broken down during the cooking process, making it safe to combine cooked fish with dairy. Additionally, some types of fish, such as cod and haddock, are considered safe to combine with dairy even when raw.</p>

<h2>Can You Have Dairy With Raw Fish?</h2>

<p>In general, it is not recommended to have dairy with raw fish. Most types of raw fish contain histamine and trypsin, which can cause an allergic reaction when combined with dairy. Additionally, some types of fish are considered unsafe to consume raw, such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, sardines, and herring. For these types of fish, it is best to cook them before consuming them with dairy.</p>

<h2>Can You Have Dairy With Smoked Fish?</h2>

<p>Smoked fish is generally considered safe to consume with dairy. The smoking process breaks down the histamine and trypsin, making it safe to consume with dairy. However, it is important to note that some types of fish, such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, sardines, and herring, are still considered unsafe to consume with dairy even after being smoked.</p>

<h2>Can You Have Dairy With Canned Fish?</h2>

<p>Canned fish is generally considered safe to consume with dairy. The canning process breaks down the histamine and trypsin, making it safe to consume with dairy. However, it is important to note that some types of fish, such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, sardines, and herring, are still considered unsafe to consume with dairy even after being canned.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In general, it is best to wait at least two hours after eating fish before drinking milk. This will give the body enough time to break down the histamine and trypsin, which can trigger an allergic reaction when combined with dairy. For cooked fish, most types are considered safe to consume with dairy. For raw fish and canned or smoked fish, some types are considered unsafe to consume with dairy. It is important to be aware of the type of fish you are consuming and the potential risks associated with combining it with dairy.</p>
