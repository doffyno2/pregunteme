<h2>The Theory of Mythology</h2>

<p>The third and final theory is that of Mythology, which states that the Garden of Eden is a mythical place that was created by ancient cultures and passed down through generations as a form of storytelling. This theory is based on the fact that many other cultures have stories of a perfect paradise that existed long ago.</p>
