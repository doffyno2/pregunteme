Clownfish, also known as anemonefish, are some of the most popular marine fish in the world. They come in a variety of beautiful colors and patterns, and they are relatively easy to care for compared to other fish species. However, when it comes to the question of whether or not clownfish are harmful, the answer is not so clear-cut.
