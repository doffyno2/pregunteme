The Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV that has been around since 2001. With its spacious interior, ample cargo room, and powerful engine, it’s no wonder the Highlander is a popular choice for families. But, can a Highlander pull a camper?

The short answer is “yes”, the Highlander can pull a camper. With the right equipment, a Highlander can tow up to 5,000 lbs, which is more than enough for most camper trailers. But, it’s important to note that the Highlander’s towing capacity depends on the trim level and engine size.

<h2>What Factors Affect the Highlander’s Towing Capacity?</h2>

When it comes to towing capacity, there are several factors that affect how much weight a Highlander can pull. These include the trim level, engine size, and transmission type. 

<h3>Trim Level</h3>

The trim level of the Highlander will determine its maximum towing capacity. For example, the base LE trim has a maximum towing capacity of 1,500 lbs, while the more powerful Limited trim can tow up to 5,000 lbs. 

<h3>Engine Size</h3>

The Highlander’s engine size also affects its towing capacity. The base LE trim is equipped with a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine, which has a maximum towing capacity of 1,500 lbs. The Limited trim is equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine, which can tow up to 5,000 lbs. 

<h3>Transmission Type</h3>

The transmission type also affects the Highlander’s towing capacity. The base LE trim is equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission, which has a maximum towing capacity of 1,500 lbs. The Limited trim is equipped with an eight-speed automatic transmission, which can tow up to 5,000 lbs. 

<h2>What Equipment Does a Highlander Need to Tow a Camper?</h2>

Before you can tow a camper with your Highlander, you’ll need to make sure you have the right equipment. In addition to the trim level, engine size, and transmission type, you’ll also need a tow hitch, trailer brakes, and a trailer wiring harness. 

<h3>Tow Hitch</h3>

A tow hitch is a metal device that attaches to the frame of the Highlander and is used to connect the vehicle to a trailer. Depending on the trailer’s weight, you may need a Class III tow hitch, which can handle up to 6,000 lbs. 

<h3>Trailer Brakes</h3>

Trailer brakes are used to control the speed of the trailer and prevent it from becoming detached from the vehicle. Depending on the trailer’s weight, you may need electric trailer brakes, which are activated by a switch in the vehicle’s cab. 

<h3>Trailer Wiring Harness</h3>

The trailer wiring harness is used to connect the vehicle’s electrical components to the trailer. This allows the trailer lights to operate correctly, and it ensures that the vehicle’s brakes are properly wired to the trailer’s brakes.
