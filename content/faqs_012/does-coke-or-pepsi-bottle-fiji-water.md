<p>The debate over which company bottles Fiji Water has been going on for some time now, and it seems like the answer is still up in the air. Coke and Pepsi have both been producing bottled water for decades, but neither of them has ever officially claimed to be the exclusive bottler of Fiji Water. While there are several theories as to why, the answer remains unclear.</p>

<p>Fiji Water is a unique brand of bottled water, sourced from the naturally alkaline spring waters of Fiji. The water is bottled in highly secure bottles, and shipped around the world. It is, however, not as widely available as other more common brands of bottled water, such as Dasani, Aquafina and Evian. This has led to speculation as to why Coke and Pepsi have not officially claimed to be the exclusive bottler of Fiji Water.</p>

<h2>Theories as to Why Coke or Pepsi Does Not Bottle Fiji Water</h2>

<p>There are a few theories as to why neither of the two major soda companies has laid claim to bottling Fiji Water. One theory is that Fiji Water has a different flavor than other bottled waters, which could make it difficult to replicate or bottle. Another theory is that the cost of producing the water is too high for either of the companies, as they would have to ship the water from Fiji to their factories around the world.</p>

<p>A third theory is that Fiji Water has a strict policy about how their water is handled and bottled, which could make it difficult for either of the companies to comply with. This includes their strict regulations on how their water is sourced, how it is treated and stored, and how it is shipped. As such, it may not be feasible for either of the two major soda companies to comply with these restrictions.</p>

<h2>The Official Word from Coke and Pepsi on Fiji Water Bottling</h2>

<p>Coke and Pepsi have both officially denied any involvement in bottling Fiji Water. In a statement released in 2011, Coke stated that “Coca-Cola does not bottle or distribute Fiji Water. We have no plans to do so in the future.” Pepsi also denied any involvement in bottling the water, stating that “PepsiCo does not bottle or distribute Fiji Water. We have no plans to do so in the future.”</p>

<p>It appears, then, that neither of the two major soda companies has any intention of bottling Fiji Water. It is unclear why this is the case, but the theories outlined above could provide some insight.</p>
