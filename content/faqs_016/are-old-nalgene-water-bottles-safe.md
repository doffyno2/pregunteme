<p>For decades, Nalgene bottles have been a go-to water bottle for hikers, campers, and outdoor enthusiasts. They are relatively lightweight, durable, and come in a variety of colors and sizes. However, there have been some concerns raised about the safety of Nalgene bottles, particularly older models. In this article, weâ€™ll take a look at the safety of Nalgene bottles, and what you should know before using them.</p>

<h2>Why Are People Worried About Older Nalgene Bottles?</h2>

<p>Nalgene bottles were first produced in the early 1990s. At that time, the bottles were made from polycarbonate plastic, which is often used for consumer goods. It is a lightweight but durable material, and its popularity for water bottles has grown in recent years. The problem is that polycarbonate plastic contains a compound called bisphenol A (BPA). BPA has been linked to a variety of health issues, including cancer, infertility, and developmental issues in children.</p>

<p>In 2008, Nalgene began phasing out the use of polycarbonate plastic in its bottles. The company now produces bottles made from Eastman Tritan, a BPA-free material. However, many older Nalgene bottles are still in circulation, and there are still concerns about the safety of these older models.</p>

<h2>Are Old Nalgene Bottles Safe?</h2>

<p>The short answer is yes, old Nalgene bottles are generally safe to use. However, it is important to note that the older bottles, which were made from polycarbonate plastic, may contain BPA. BPA is not considered to be a safe chemical for human health, and there is some evidence to suggest that it can be absorbed through the skin or through the food and drinks that we consume from plastic containers.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you are using an old Nalgene bottle, it is best to replace it with a newer model. Newer models are made from Eastman Tritan, which is a BPA-free material. Additionally, if you are using an old Nalgene bottle for drinking, it is best to avoid microwaving it or putting it in the dishwasher, as this can cause the plastic to break down and release BPA.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Nalgene Bottles?</h2>

<p>Nalgene bottles are a popular choice for hikers, campers, and other outdoor enthusiasts for a number of reasons. They are lightweight and durable, which makes them easy to carry and less likely to break. Additionally, they come in a variety of colors and sizes, so you can find one that suits your needs. Nalgene bottles are also relatively inexpensive, which makes them a great choice for those on a budget.</p>

<p>The main benefit of Nalgene bottles is their durability. They can withstand a lot of wear and tear, and they are unlikely to break if dropped. This makes them ideal for outdoor activities, where the risk of dropping or breaking a bottle is higher. Additionally, Nalgene bottles are made from safe materials, so you don't have to worry about them leaching chemicals into your water.</p>

<h2>How To Care For Nalgene Bottles</h2>

<p>Caring for your Nalgene bottle is important to ensure that it lasts as long as possible. Here are some tips for taking care of your Nalgene bottle:</p>
