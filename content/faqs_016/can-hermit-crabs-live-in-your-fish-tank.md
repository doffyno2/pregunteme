<p>Hermit crabs are among the most popular pets in the world. They are small, colorful, and relatively easy to care for. But can they live in your fish tank? The answer is yes, with some important caveats. </p>

<h2>Do Hermit Crabs Need a Tank?</h2>

<p>The enclosure should also be equipped with places for them to hide and climb. This can be accomplished with rocks, driftwood, and other decorations. The enclosure should also have a lid, to keep the crabs from escaping. </p>

<h2>Can You Have Hermit Crabs and Fish in the Same Tank?</h2>

<p>Hermit crabs can also be aggressive towards fish. They will defend their territory, which can lead to fights between them and the fish. And hermit crabs can climb out of the tank, which can cause problems if they land in a fish tank. </p>
