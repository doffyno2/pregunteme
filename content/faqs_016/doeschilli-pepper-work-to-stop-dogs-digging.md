<h2>What is chili pepper?</h2>

<h2>How does chili pepper work to stop dogs digging?</h2>

The scent and taste of the chili pepper is unpleasant to dogs, so they’ll do their best to avoid it.</p>

<h2>How do I use chili pepper to stop my dog from digging?</h2>

<p>Start by sprinkling a light layer of chili pepper powder on the area you want to protect. You can also mix the chili pepper with water and pour it into a spray bottle for easier application.

<h2>Are there any alternatives to using chili pepper?</h2>
