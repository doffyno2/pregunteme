<p>Hot dogs are a classic American food staple, enjoyed by people of all ages. Though they are a popular choice for summer barbecues, many people are unsure of what they are made of. One of the biggest questions surrounding hot dogs is do all beef hot dogs contain pork?</p>

<p>The answer is yes, some hot dogs do contain pork, but not all of them. The majority of hot dogs are made with a combination of beef, pork, and other meats, while some brands only use beef.
