<h2>What is Meloxicam?</h2>

Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammation in both humans and animals. It is commonly prescribed to dogs for arthritis and other painful joint conditions. However, it is important to note that meloxicam is a prescription drug, and should only be given to your pet under the direction of a veterinarian.

<h2>What is the Recommended Dosage of Meloxicam?</h2>

The recommended dosage of meloxicam for dogs varies based on the size and weight of the dog, and the condition being treated. A veterinarian should be consulted to determine the correct dosage for your pet. Generally, the starting dosage is 0.1-0.2 mg/kg, once daily. This can be increased as needed up to 0.3 mg/kg, once daily.

<h2>Can You Give a Dog Outdated Meloxicam?</h2>

It is generally not recommended to give a dog outdated meloxicam. The potency and effectiveness of the drug decreases over time, and meloxicam should be taken within the expiration date for optimal effect. If a dog is prescribed meloxicam, it is important to ensure the medication is not expired before giving it to your pet.

<h2>What Are the Side Effects of Meloxicam?</h2>

Like any medication, meloxicam does come with certain side effects. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and lethargy. It is also important to note that meloxicam can interact with other medications, so it is important to inform your veterinarian of all medications your pet is taking.

<h2>What Is the Proper Storage of Meloxicam?</h2>

Meloxicam should be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and light. It is also important to keep it out of the reach of children and pets. Do not use meloxicam past the expiration date, and keep track of when the medication was purchased so that you can ensure it is not expired when it is given to your pet.

<h2>What Are Some Alternatives to Meloxicam?</h2>

If a dog is not responding well to meloxicam, there are other options available. Other NSAIDs such as carprofen and deracoxib can be used in place of meloxicam. Additionally, there are also other treatments for arthritis such as glucosamine and chondroitin supplements, acupuncture, and physical therapy.
