Long haired wiener dogs, also known as dachshunds, are one of the cutest and most popular breeds of dogs. But for those who suffer from allergies, the question of whether or not these lovable little dogs are hypoallergenic is an important one.

<h2>What is Hypoallergenic?</h2>

The term "hypoallergenic" is used to describe something that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction than something else. In the case of pets, this means that a hypoallergenic pet produces less dander, the tiny flakes of skin that are the main cause of pet allergies.

<h2>Are Long Haired Wiener Dogs Hypoallergenic?</h2>

The short answer is, unfortunately, no. While long haired wiener dogs produce less dander than other breeds, they are not considered to be hypoallergenic. This is due to the fact that they still produce enough dander to cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to pet allergens.

<h2>Are There Any Hypoallergenic Breeds of Dogs?</h2>

Yes, there are some breeds of dogs that are considered to be hypoallergenic. These include poodles, Maltese, shih tzus, bichon frises, and some terriers. However, even with these breeds, there is no guarantee that they will not cause allergic reactions in some people, as there is no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog.

<h2>Do Long Haired Wiener Dogs Shed?</h2>

Yes, long haired wiener dogs do shed. They are considered to be a moderate shedding breed, meaning that they shed a moderate amount of hair. While they don't shed as much as some other breeds, they still shed enough to create a mess in the house.

<h2>How to Minimize Allergens from Long Haired Wiener Dogs?</h2>

There are a few things that can be done to minimize the amount of allergens produced by long haired wiener dogs. The first is to keep the dog well groomed. Regular brushing can help reduce the amount of dander in the dog's coat and help to reduce the amount of allergens in the home.

Secondly, regular vacuuming can help reduce the amount of dander and hair in the home. Vacuuming carpets and furniture regularly can help to reduce the amount of allergens in the home.

Finally, it is important to keep the dog away from the bedroom or any other areas where someone with allergies might be. Keeping the dog out of the bedroom and other areas can help to minimize the amount of allergens in the air.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Long haired wiener dogs are not considered to be hypoallergenic, but there are still ways to minimize the amount of allergens they produce. Regular grooming, vacuuming, and keeping the dog away from areas where people with allergies are can help to reduce the amount of allergens in the home.
