When it comes to dog diets, salmon oil is often touted as a superfood. It is rich in Omega 3 fatty acids and has been shown to help with joint health, allergies, and skin and coat health. But can salmon oil be bad for dogs? The answer is that it can be, depending on the source and quality of the oil.
