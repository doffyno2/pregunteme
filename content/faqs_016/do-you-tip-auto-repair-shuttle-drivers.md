<p>If you don’t own a car, you may rely on public transportation or a rideshare app like Uber to get around. But what happens when your car needs to go to the auto repair shop? Many auto repair shops now offer a shuttle service to pick up and drop off customers. Do you tip the driver?</p>

<p>Tipping etiquette can be tricky, but it’s important to show your appreciation for the service you receive. Tipping is especially important when you’re getting help from someone who works in the service industry. But how much should you tip a shuttle driver?</p>

<h2>When Should You Tip an Auto Repair Shuttle Driver?</h2>

<p>The first question to ask yourself is whether you should tip the shuttle driver. Generally speaking, you should tip any service provider who goes above and beyond to help you. For example, if the shuttle driver helps you load and unload your luggage, or if they take an extra-long route to accommodate your request, tipping is appropriate. On the other hand, if you only receive basic service, a tip isn’t expected.</p>

<p>In some cases, the auto repair shop may include a tip in the fee they charge you for the shuttle service. In this case, you don’t need to tip the driver. However, if the driver provides exemplary service, you may want to tip them regardless of the fee.</p>

<h2>How Much Should You Tip an Auto Repair Shuttle Driver?</h2>

<p>If you decide to tip the driver, the amount you give them should depend on the level of service you receive. A good rule of thumb is to tip the driver 10-15% of the fee the auto repair shop charges you for the ride. If the driver does something extra for you, you may want to increase the tip.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that the driver is not an employee of the auto repair shop. They are usually a third-party service provider, so it’s important to show your appreciation for the service they provide.</p>

<h2>Tipping Etiquette for Other Service Providers</h2>

<p>Tipping etiquette isn’t just important for auto repair shuttle drivers. It’s also important to tip service providers like hairstylists, nail technicians, and massage therapists. Again, the amount you tip should depend on the level of service you receive. For beauty services, a 10-20% tip is appropriate. For massage services, a 15-20% tip is typical. If you’re unsure of how much to tip, err on the side of generosity.</p>
