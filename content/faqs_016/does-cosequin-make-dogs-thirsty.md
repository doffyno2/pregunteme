<p>If you're a dog owner looking to give your pup the best possible care, you've probably considered giving your pup a joint supplement like Cosequin. Joint supplements can be incredibly beneficial for aging or active dogs, as they can help ease joint pain and support healthy joint function. But is there any truth to the claim that Cosequin can make your pup thirsty?</p>

<p>The answer is, no. Cosequin is an entirely natural supplement that is designed to help support joint health, not to make your pup thirsty. In fact, Cosequin is specifically designed to be safe for your pup's digestive system, which means it won't cause any dehydration or thirst. That being said, it's important to remember that Cosequin is not a substitute for proper hydration, so you should still make sure that your pup has plenty of fresh, clean water to drink every day.</p>
