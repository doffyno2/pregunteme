Are Boxer Beagle Mixes Good Dogs?

Boxer beagle mixes, or boxer-beagles, are an increasingly popular designer breed, and itâ€™s easy to understand why. These dogs are a mix between two of the most beloved and recognizable breeds around, and the combination of their traits often results in a dog that is the best of both worlds. But before you bring one of these pups home, it's important to understand what to expect from a boxer-beagle mix.

What is a Boxer Beagle Mix?

A boxer-beagle mix is a designer dog that is created by crossing a purebred boxer with a purebred beagle. The result is a pup that can have the physical characteristics of both breeds.

The boxer is a medium-sized breed that typically weighs between 40 and 70 pounds. They have a broad, deep chest and stand between 21 and 25 inches tall. Boxers have a short, smooth coat, and they come in a variety of colors, including fawn, brindle, and white.

The beagle is a small breed that typically weighs between 18 and 30 pounds. They stand between 13 and 16 inches tall and have a short, dense coat that can be any combination of black, white, brown, and tan.

Boxer-beagles are a mixed breed, so it's impossible to predict exactly what traits they will inherit. However, it is possible to get an idea of what to expect from a boxer-beagle mix.
