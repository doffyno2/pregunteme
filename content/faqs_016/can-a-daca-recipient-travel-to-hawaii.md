<p>For many people, the dream of traveling to Hawaii is one that they strive to achieve. Unfortunately, for some, their ability to do so is restricted due to their immigration status. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is one such example. This program gives certain undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children an opportunity to stay in the country and receive a work permit. But what about travel? Can a DACA recipient travel to Hawaii? </p>

<p>The answer to this question is not a simple one. There are a few factors that need to be taken into consideration when it comes to determining whether or not a DACA recipient can travel to Hawaii. The first factor is the DACA recipient’s immigration status itself. If the DACA recipient is a non-immigrant, meaning they are in the US on a temporary basis and do not possess a green card or other form of permanent residence, then they will need to apply for a travel visa. This visa would need to be approved by the US government before they can travel to Hawaii. </p>

<p>However, if the DACA recipient does have a green card or other form of permanent residence, then they will be able to travel to Hawaii without having to apply for a travel visa. In this case, they will simply need to have a valid passport and be able to demonstrate that they are able to financially support themselves while in Hawaii. </p>

<p>The second factor to consider is whether or not the DACA recipient is traveling for business or pleasure. If they are traveling for business, then they will need to obtain a business visa in order to enter the state. If they are traveling for pleasure, then they will not need to obtain a visa, but they will still need to be able to demonstrate that they are able to support themselves while in Hawaii. </p>

<p>Finally, it is important to note that even if a DACA recipient is able to travel to Hawaii, they will still face restrictions on their stay. The state of Hawaii has strict laws regarding the length of stay for non-citizens, and these laws apply to both permanent and non-permanent residents. Depending on the circumstances, a DACA recipient may only be allowed to stay in Hawaii for a certain period of time. </p>
