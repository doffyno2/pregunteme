Traveling by plane can be stressful enough without having to worry about what you can and cannot bring on board. One of the main items that passengers want to bring on is an empty water bottle, as they want to save money by filling it up at a drinking fountain at the airport or on board the plane. In this article, we’ll look at the regulations around bringing an empty water bottle on a plane, and provide some tips on how to make the process easier.

<h2>Can You Take An Empty Water Bottle On A Plane?</h2>

The short answer is yes. According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), you can bring an empty water bottle on a plane with you. However, you will need to make sure that the bottle is empty before you go through security. This means that even if the bottle has been sealed, it must still be emptied before you go through security.

<h2>How Big of An Empty Water Bottle Can You Bring On A Plane?</h2>

The size of the water bottle that you can bring on a plane is limited by the regulations of each airline. Generally, most airlines allow passengers to bring a water bottle that is no more than 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) in size, but some airlines may allow larger bottles. It’s always best to check with the airline before you travel.

<h2>Tips For Bringing An Empty Water Bottle On A Plane</h2>

There are a few tips that can make bringing an empty water bottle on a plane easier. Firstly, it’s important to remember that the bottle must be emptied before you go through security. This means that you should plan ahead and make sure you’ve got a water bottle that you can easily empty before you go through security.

It’s also important to bear in mind that the bottle must be able to be sealed. This means that it must have a lid or a cap that can be securely closed. If the bottle does not have a lid or a cap, then it cannot be brought on the plane.

Finally, it’s also important to remember that you may be asked to remove the bottle from your carry-on luggage when you go through security. This is because the bottle must be scanned separately from your other items.

<h2>What Else Can You Bring On A Plane?</h2>

In addition to an empty water bottle, there are a few other items that you can bring on a plane. These include:

<h3>Food</h3>

You can bring solid food items such as sandwiches, snacks, and fruit on a plane. However, you should bear in mind that any liquids or gels must be in containers of 3.4 ounces or less.
