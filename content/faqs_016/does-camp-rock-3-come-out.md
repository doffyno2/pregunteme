<p>Camp Rock, the Disney Channel movie that took the world by storm, is one of the most beloved films of the early 2000s. While the movie has spawned two sequels, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam and Camp Rock: The Final Jam Live!, fans of the original have been left wondering if a third installment of the franchise might be in the works. </p>

<p>The answer is, unfortunately, that there are currently no plans for a Camp Rock 3.
