<p>When it comes to the question of whether unopened hot dogs can go bad, the answer is a bit complicated. Hot dogs are highly processed and preserved, and can last for quite some time without going bad. However, there are certain factors that can affect the shelf life of hot dogs, and ultimately cause them to spoil. To understand how long an unopened package of hot dogs can last, and what signs to look out for, read on.</p>

<h2>How Long Can Unopened Hot Dogs Last?</h2>

<p>In general, unopened hot dogs can last up to two weeks in the refrigerator and up to two months in the freezer. This is true for both cooked and uncooked hot dogs, though uncooked hot dogs have a slightly longer shelf life. Hot dogs come in sealed packages, so they are usually safe to eat for the time period stated on the package. However, it is important to note that the quality of hot dogs can start to decline after the expiration date, so it is best to consume them before then.</p>

<h2>Signs That Hot Dogs Have Gone Bad</h2>

<p>Although unopened hot dogs can last for quite some time, it is still important to look out for signs that they have gone bad. The most obvious sign is a change in color or odor. If the hot dogs have developed a slimy or sticky texture, or if they smell off, it is best to discard them. Additionally, if the package has been punctured or opened, the hot dogs should be discarded, as bacteria may have entered the package.</p>

<h2>Storing Hot Dogs</h2>

<p>Hot dogs should be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, whichever is appropriate. If they are stored in the refrigerator, they should be placed in an airtight container or bag to prevent them from spoiling. Hot dogs should also be eaten within a few days of opening, as they will not last as long as unopened hot dogs. Additionally, cooked hot dogs should not be placed back in the refrigerator after they have been cooked, as they may spoil quickly.</p>

<h2>How to Tell if Hot Dogs Are Cooked</h2>

<p>When cooking hot dogs, it is important to make sure that they are cooked through. The best way to tell if hot dogs are cooked is to look for an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C). Additionally, the hot dogs should be steaming hot, and the center should be slightly firm to the touch. If the hot dogs are not cooked through, they should be cooked for a few minutes longer.</p>

<h2>How to Reheat Hot Dogs</h2>

<p>Hot dogs can be reheated in a variety of ways. The most common way is to heat them in the microwave or on the stovetop. To reheat in the microwave, simply wrap the hot dogs in a damp paper towel and heat for 30 seconds or until heated through. To reheat on the stovetop, heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add a bit of oil. Once the oil is hot, add the hot dogs to the skillet and cook until heated through.</p>
