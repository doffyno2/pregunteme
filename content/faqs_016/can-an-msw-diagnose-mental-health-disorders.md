<p>Mental health disorders have become increasingly common in our society. With the rise of mental health awareness, there has been an influx of mental health professionals seeking to help those in need. Among these professionals is the Master of Social Work (MSW). MSW’s are highly trained professionals who offer counseling and therapy to those dealing with mental health issues.</p>

<p>While MSW’s are trained to diagnose and treat mental health issues, they are not allowed to diagnose mental health disorders. This is because the diagnosis of mental health disorders is a complex process that requires specialized training and experience.
