How Big Is the World's Biggest Spider?

Spiders are a fascinating species of arthropods that have been around for over 400 million years. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors and have adapted to a wide range of environments. As such, spiders can be found in almost every corner of the world, from the Arctic tundra to the tropical rainforest. One of the most interesting aspects of spiders is the size range that they can reach. While some spiders are barely visible to the naked eye, others can be huge creatures that are quite intimidating. So, just how big can the world's largest spider get?



The world's biggest spider is the Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), which can be found in the rainforests of South America. It is the biggest species of tarantula and can reach up to 10 inches (25 cm) in length and weigh up to 6 ounces (170 grams). In terms of leg span, the Goliath Birdeater can reach up to 12 inches (30 cm) across. This makes it one of the biggest arthropods in the world.

<h2>What Do Goliath Birdeaters Look Like?</h2>

Goliath Birdeaters are large and intimidating creatures. They have long legs and a body that is covered in a thick, velvety fur. The fur can be black, brown, or even a reddish color. They also have two large eyes that are set close together, giving them excellent vision. The Goliath Birdeater also has a large pair of chelicerae, which are the structures that they use to grab their prey. The chelicerae are connected to venom glands, which are used to paralyze their prey.

<h2>What Do Goliath Birdeaters Eat?</h2>

Contrary to their name, Goliath Birdeaters do not actually eat birds. Instead, they feed primarily on insects, frogs, lizards, and even small mammals. They are also known to scavenge for carrion. Goliath Birdeaters also have an interesting feeding habit called 'balling.' This is when the spider wraps its prey in its legs and chelicerae, forming a ball-like shape that is then sucked dry.

<h2>Are Goliath Birdeaters Dangerous?</h2>

Although Goliath Birdeaters are large and intimidating, they are not considered to be dangerous to humans. They are docile creatures, and will usually only bite if they feel threatened. Even then, their venom is not strong enough to cause any serious harm to humans.

<h2>What is the Largest Spider Ever Found?</h2>

The largest spider ever found was a Goliath Birdeater that was discovered in Brazil in 2020. It was 10 inches in length and weighed 6 ounces (170 grams). This makes it the largest spider ever found, and it is believed to be a record-breaking size for this species.

<h2>Are There Any Other Large Spiders?</h2>

The Brazilian Salmon Pink Birdeater (Lasiodora parahybana) can reach up to 8 inches (20 cm) in length, while the Colombian Giant Tarantula (Megaphobema robustum) can reach up to 7 inches (17 cm). Other large species include the Giant Huntsman Spider (Heteropoda venatoria) and the Chilean Rose Tarantula (Grammostola rosea).
