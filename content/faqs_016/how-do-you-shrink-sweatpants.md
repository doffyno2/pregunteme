Sweatpants are a great addition to your wardrobe – they’re comfortable, they keep you warm, and, depending on the style, they can look really cool. But, the problem with sweatpants is that they’re often too big for the wearer. If you’ve just bought a pair of sweatpants and you’re wondering how to shrink them, fear not – it’s actually really simple. Here are 6 easy steps to help you shrink your sweatpants.

<h2>Step 1: Wash Your Sweatpants</h2>

Before you start shrinking your sweatpants, you’ll need to give them a good wash. Washing your sweatpants will help to remove some of the dirt and grime that’s accumulated on them, and it will also help to prepare them for the shrinking process. 

When washing your sweatpants, make sure to use a detergent that’s specifically designed for clothing – this will help to ensure that the fabric won’t be damaged during the shrinking process. You should also be sure to check the care label on your sweatpants to make sure that they can be washed in hot water. If the care label states that you should only wash your sweatpants in cold or warm water, then you should follow this advice. 

<h2>Step 2: Choose the Right Cycle</h2>

Once you’ve filled up your washing machine with your sweatpants, you’ll need to select the right cycle. It’s important to select the right cycle, as this will determine how much your sweatpants will shrink. If you select a cycle that’s too gentle, then your sweatpants may not shrink at all. 

If your sweatpants can be washed in hot water, then the best cycle to use is the ‘Hot’ cycle. This cycle will help to shrink your sweatpants as much as possible. However, if your sweatpants can only be washed in cold or warm water, then you’ll need to use the ‘Delicate’ cycle. This cycle will help to shrink your sweatpants slightly, but not as much as the ‘Hot’ cycle. 

<h2>Step 3: Add Vinegar to the Wash</h2>

Once you’ve selected the right cycle for your sweatpants, you’ll need to add some vinegar to the wash. Adding vinegar to the wash will help to soften the fabric of your sweatpants, which will make them more prone to shrinking. You should add around ¼ cup of white vinegar to the wash – this should be enough to soften the fabric of your sweatpants. 

<h2>Step 4: Dry Your Sweatpants</h2>

Once your sweatpants have been washed, you’ll need to dry them. It’s important to dry your sweatpants properly, as this will help to shrink them. If you dry your sweatpants in the dryer, then you should select a high heat setting – this will help to shrink your sweatpants as much as possible. 

However, if you don’t have access to a dryer, then you can also air-dry your sweatpants. To do this, simply hang your sweatpants up on a clothesline or a drying rack and let them air-dry. This method will take longer than using a dryer, but it will still help to shrink your sweatpants. 

<h2>Step 5: Iron Your Sweatpants</h2>

Once your sweatpants are dry, you’ll need to iron them. Ironing your sweatpants will help to shrink them even further. When ironing your sweatpants, make sure to set the iron to a high heat setting – this will help to shrink the fabric of your sweatpants. 

It’s also important to iron your sweatpants in the right direction – you should iron the fabric in the same direction that the fabric is meant to be worn. For example, if your sweatpants have a ‘grain’ that runs vertically, then you should iron them in a vertical direction. 

<h2>Step 6: Try on Your Sweatpants</h2>

Once you’ve finished ironing your sweatpants, it’s time to try them on. Put on your sweatpants and see how they fit – if they’re still too big for you, then you can always repeat the shrinking process until they fit perfectly.
