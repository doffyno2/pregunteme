<p>Garter snakes are a type of non-venomous snake, found throughout North America and parts of Europe and Asia. They are typically small and harmless, and are a common pet for snake enthusiasts. But can garter snakes hurt dogs?</p>

<p>The short answer is no, garter snakes do not pose any danger to dogs. Garter snakes are not venomous and they have relatively small teeth, so they are unable to bite or harm a dog in any way. In addition, garter snakes tend to be shy and will avoid confrontation whenever possible. If a dog were to encounter a garter snake, the snake would likely try to escape rather than fight.</p>

<p>However, it is important to note that garter snakes can be defensive when provoked or threatened. If a dog were to corner or pursue a garter snake, the snake could try to defend itself by biting or releasing a musky smell from its anal glands. While these defensive tactics are unlikely to cause any serious harm to a dog, it’s best to be cautious and avoid any potential conflicts.</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that garter snakes can carry parasites, such as ticks and fleas, that can be harmful to dogs. If a dog were to come into contact with a garter snake, it’s a good idea to check the dog for any signs of parasites.</p>
