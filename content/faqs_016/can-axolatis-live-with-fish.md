Can Axolotls Live With Fish? 

Axolotls are a species of Mexican mole salamander, and they are widely popular as pets. They are often kept with other aquatic creatures, such as fish, in order to create a more interesting tank. But can axolotls live with fish? 

<h2>What Are Axolotls?</h2>
Axolotls are a type of aquatic salamander that is native to Mexico. They are often kept as pets due to their unique appearance and docile behavior. They can live up to 15 years in captivity and are relatively easy to care for. 

<h2>Do Axolotls Get Along With Fish?</h2>
In general, axolotls can live peacefully with many types of fish. However, there are some important things to consider before mixing the two. 

<h3>Compatible Fish</h3>
Axolotls are carnivores that prefer to eat live prey, such as small fish, worms, and insects. It is important to choose fish that are too big for the axolotl to eat. It is also important to choose fish that are not aggressive, as this can cause stress for both the axolotl and the fish. Some good options for compatible fish include livebearers (such as mollies and platies), danios, and small barbs. 

<h3>Incompatible Fish</h3>
Some fish should not be kept with axolotls. These include fish that are too small and could be eaten by the axolotl, fish that are aggressive, and fish that require a warmer environment. Goldfish, guppies, and bettas should not be kept with axolotls, as they can cause stress and can be eaten by the axolotl. 

<h2>Tips for Keeping Axolotls and Fish Together</h2>
If you decide to keep axolotls and fish together, there are some important steps you should take to ensure the safety and health of both species. 

<h3>Provide Plenty of Space</h3>
The tank should be at least 20 gallons, and it should be heavily planted to provide hiding places for both the axolotl and the fish. This will help to reduce stress and ensure that both species have enough space. 

<h3>Provide Plenty of Food</h3>
It is important to provide enough food for both the axolotl and the fish. Axolotls should be fed a variety of live prey, such as worms, small fish, and insects. Fish should be fed a variety of foods, such as pellets, flakes, and frozen foods. 

<h3>Monitor Tank Conditions</h3>
