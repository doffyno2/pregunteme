<p>Fish can be divided into two main groups - osmoconformers and osmoregulators. Osmoconformers are fish that are able to maintain the same concentration of salts and other dissolved substances in their body fluids as the surrounding sea water. Osmoregulators, on the other hand, are able to regulate their internal osmotic pressure, maintaining it different from that of the surrounding environment. This article explains the difference between osmoconformers and osmoregulators, and why it is important for the survival of fish.</p>

<h2>What is Osmosis?</h2>

<p>Osmosis is the process by which water molecules move through a semi-permeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration. This movement is caused by the difference in the concentration of water molecules on either side of the membrane. In fish, osmosis is used to regulate the amount of water and salts in the body. This process is known as osmoregulation.</p>

<h2>Osmoconformers</h2>

<p>Osmoconformers are fish that can maintain the same concentration of salts and other dissolved substances in their body fluids as the surrounding sea water. These fish do not need to regulate their body fluids, as they are able to adjust to the same salinity and osmotic pressure as that of the surrounding environment. Many species of fish, such as some sharks, rays, and skates, are osmoconformers. These fish are able to survive in waters with varying salinities, as they can adjust to the changes in osmotic pressure.</p>

<h2>Osmoregulators</h2>

<p>Osmoregulators are fish that can regulate the salinity and osmotic pressure of their body fluids. These fish are able to maintain a different concentration of salts and other dissolved substances in their body fluids from that of the surrounding sea water. This allows them to survive in waters with varying salinities. Many species of fish, such as some bony fishes, eels, and carps, are osmoregulators.</p>

<h2>Why is Osmoregulation Important for Fish?</h2>

<p>Osmoregulation is an important process for fish, as it enables them to survive in waters with varying salinities. Osmoconformers are able to adjust their body fluids to match the salinity of their environment, while osmoregulators can maintain their body fluids at a different concentration from that of the surrounding environment. This ability to regulate their body fluids is essential for the survival of fish in waters with varying salinities.</p>
