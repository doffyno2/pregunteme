<p>If you're having trouble getting your automatic transmission to go into gear when it's cold outside, you're not alone. Many drivers experience this issue, especially during the winter months when temperatures drop significantly. While this problem can be caused by a variety of issues, the most common culprit is a failing torque converter. In this article, we'll discuss what causes this issue and how you can fix it.</p>

<h2>What Causes Automatic Transmission Wont Go Into Gear When Cold?</h2>

<p>When the temperature outside drops below freezing, the internal components of your car's automatic transmission are affected as well. The most common cause of this is the torque converter, which is responsible for transferring power from the engine to the transmission. When it's cold outside, the fluid in the torque converter thickens, making it harder for the converter to operate properly. This can cause your car to struggle to shift into gear, or not shift at all.</p>

<p>Other causes of this issue include low transmission fluid levels, dirty transmission fluid, and worn-out transmission components. If these components are not replaced regularly, they can become clogged or worn down, making it difficult for your car to shift into gear.</p>

<h2>How to Fix Automatic Transmission Wont Go Into Gear When Cold</h2>

<p>In order to fix the automatic transmission won't go into gear when cold issue, you'll need to do a few things. The first is to check the transmission fluid levels and make sure they are at the correct level. You can do this by checking the dipstick in the engine bay. If the fluid levels are low, you may need to top them off with new fluid.</p>

<p>The next step is to make sure the transmission fluid is clean. Dirty transmission fluid can cause shifting issues, so you'll need to have it replaced. If the transmission fluid is still clean, then you should check the torque converter to make sure it is operating properly. You can do this by taking the car for a test drive and seeing if it shifts smoothly.</p>

<p>If the problem persists, then you may need to have the transmission components replaced. This can be a costly repair, but it is necessary if you want to ensure your car is running properly. It's also important to keep up with the regular maintenance of your car, as this can help prevent transmission issues from occurring.</p>
