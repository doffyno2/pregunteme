<h2>What is a Ford Smart Junction Box?</h2>

The Ford Smart Junction Box (SJB) is an essential part of the electrical system in your Ford vehicle. It is a junction block that consolidates the power distribution system within the vehicle. It acts as a central hub for the relays and fuses within the vehicle, and is responsible for controlling many of the electrical functions of your vehicle. Without a properly functioning SJB, your vehicle could suffer from a variety of electrical issues and malfunctions.
