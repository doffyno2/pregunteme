<p>Travelling can be a stressful experience, especially when it comes to what you can and can't bring in your carry-on. One of the most common items that people ask about is hairspray. Can you bring hairspray in your carry-on? Can you bring travel size hairspray on a plane?</p>

<p>The good news is that yes, you can bring travel size hairspray on a plane. However, the amount of hairspray that you can bring is limited. According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), passengers are allowed to bring travel size containers of hairspray that are 3.4 ounces or less in their carry-on luggage. This means that you can bring a travel size hairspray that is 3.4 ounces or less in your carry-on, but not in your checked luggage.</p>

<p>It is important to note that you must adhere to the 3.4 ounce limit when it comes to hairspray. If you have a larger bottle of hairspray, it must be placed in your checked luggage. Additionally, the TSA states that all containers of liquids, aerosols, and gels must be placed in a single, quart-sized, clear plastic bag. This includes travel size hairspray.</p>

<p>In addition to the 3.4 ounce size limit, there are other restrictions on what type of hairspray is allowed on planes. The TSA states that hairspray must be in a pump-style container and must be "manufactured in such a way that it does not contain a hazardous material or pose a risk to the aircraft." This means that you cannot bring hairspray cans that contain flammable propellants such as butane. If you are unsure of what type of hairspray is allowed, it is best to check with the airline before you board the plane.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that the TSA has the right to inspect any item that you are bringing on the plane. This means that they can ask to inspect your hairspray at any time. You should be prepared with the size limit and type of hairspray that is allowed so that you can comply with their request quickly.</p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between Travel Size and Regular Size Hairspray?</h2>

<p>Travel size hairspray typically comes in a smaller size than regular size hairspray, which can range from 8-16 ounces. Travel size hairspray is typically 3.4 ounces or less, making it much easier to carry on the plane. The smaller size also makes it easier to store in luggage and carry around during travel.</p>

<p>The other difference between travel size and regular size hairspray is the price. Travel size hairspray is usually much cheaper than regular size hairspray, making it a great option if you are looking to save money on your travels. The smaller size also means that you can easily purchase multiple bottles of travel size hairspray to last you through your trip.</p>

<h2>What Else Should I Know About Travel Size Hairspray?</h2>

<p>When travelling with travel size hairspray, it is important to make sure that the container is properly sealed. The TSA states that all containers must be sealed and that any containers that appear to have been opened or tampered with will not be allowed on the plane.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that aerosol cans of hairspray are not allowed on planes. This includes aerosol cans of dry shampoo, hair spray, and other styling products. All of these products must be in non-aerosol containers.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to remember that the rules and regulations regarding what you can and cannot bring on a plane may vary from airline to airline.
