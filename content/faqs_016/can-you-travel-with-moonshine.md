<h2>What is Moonshine?</h2>

Moonshine is an alcoholic beverage made from corn, sugar, yeast and water. It is also known as white lightning, hooch, white whiskey or mountain dew.

It is illegal to produce, transport and sell moonshine in the United States and most other countries, except under specific circumstances when it is produced for medical reasons.

<h2>History of Moonshine</h2>

Moonshine has been a part of American culture since the early 1700s when it was used to pay taxes in some parts of the country. During the time of the American Revolution, it was used to fund the war effort and was a popular form of currency. By the 1800s, moonshine was widely produced and was often used to pay for goods and services in rural areas.

Moonshine was also popular during the Prohibition era when it was illegal to produce and sell alcohol. This led to a surge in the production of moonshine and the establishment of large-scale production centers. During this time, moonshine became a symbol of rebellion and was widely consumed.
