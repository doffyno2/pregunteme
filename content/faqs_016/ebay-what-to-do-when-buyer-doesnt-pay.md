<p>When you sell items on eBay, you expect buyers to pay for the items they purchase. Unfortunately, that does not always happen and sometimes buyers do not pay for items. If you are in this situation, it is important to know what to do when a buyer does not pay on eBay. In this article, we will provide you with some tips and advice on how to handle situations when a buyer does not pay.</p>

<h2>Understand eBay's Policy</h2>

<p>The first step in understanding what to do when a buyer does not pay on eBay is to understand eBay's policy. eBay has a strict policy that buyers must pay for items they have purchased. eBay's policy states that if a buyer does not pay within four days, then the seller can open an Unpaid Item Case. The seller can open an Unpaid Item Case after four days if the buyer has not paid and the seller has not received payment.</p>

<h2>Send a Reminder to the Buyer</h2>

<p>If the buyer has not paid after four days and you have not received payment, you should send a reminder to the buyer. You can do this by sending a message to the buyer through eBay. You should be polite and explain that the payment is due and that you need to receive payment in order to ship the item. If the buyer does not respond, then you should wait another two days before taking further action.</p>

<h2>Open an Unpaid Item Case</h2>

<p>If you have not received payment after six days and the buyer has not responded to your message, then you can open an Unpaid Item Case. You can open an Unpaid Item Case by going to the Resolution Center on eBay. Once you open the Unpaid Item Case, eBay will contact the buyer and explain the situation. If the buyer does not respond or does not pay, then eBay will close the case and you will be able to receive a refund for the item.</p>

<h2>Resolve Disputes Through PayPal</h2>

<p>If the buyer has paid through PayPal and you have not received payment, then you should contact PayPal to resolve the dispute. PayPal will contact the buyer and explain the situation. If the buyer does not respond or does not pay, then PayPal will resolve the dispute in your favor and you will receive a refund for the item.</p>

<h2>What to Do if the Buyer Pays Late</h2>

<p>If the buyer pays after you have opened an Unpaid Item Case, then you should contact eBay and explain the situation. eBay may be able to close the case and you will still be able to receive payment for the item. It is important to note that eBay will not close the case if the buyer pays late, so you should make sure to contact eBay as soon as possible.</p>
