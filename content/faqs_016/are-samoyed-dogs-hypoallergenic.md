<p>The Samoyed is a beautiful white fluffy dog, with an outgoing and friendly personality. They are an ancient breed, with roots in the north of Russia. Samoyeds were originally bred to pull sleds and herd reindeer, and their thick coats were designed to keep them warm in the cold Arctic climates. Samoyeds are now popular family pets, but many people have questions about their hypoallergenic status. So, are Samoyeds hypoallergenic?</p>

<p>The answer is no, Samoyeds are not hypoallergenic. They are a double-coated breed, meaning they have two layers of fur. This thick double coat is designed to keep the Samoyed warm and comfortable in cold temperatures, but it also means that they shed a lot. Samoyeds shed year-round, and they have a heavy seasonal shed in the spring and fall. All that shedding can cause problems for people with allergies.</p>

<p>Allergies to dogs are caused by dander, which is dead skin cells that are shed by the dog. These skin cells are mixed in with the fur, so any dog that sheds can cause allergic reactions in some people. Samoyeds shed more than most breeds, and their thick double coat means that there is more dander and fur in the air, which can make allergies worse. However, some people are not allergic to the Samoyed breed, and there are ways to reduce the amount of dander and shedding in your home.</p>
