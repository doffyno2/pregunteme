<p>Dutch extreme athlete Wim Hof is known for pushing his body to the limits.

But did he actually wear shoes during his climb of Mt. Everest?</p>

<p>The answer is yes. Wim Hof did wear shoes during his climb of Mount Everest. He wore a pair of lightweight trail-running shoes, which he purchased in Kathmandu before setting off on his ascent. The shoes provided good grip on the icy terrain, and also helped to protect his feet from the cold temperatures and sharp rocks.</p>

<p>The shoes that Wim Hof chose for his climb of Mt. Everest were not just any ordinary shoes. They were designed specifically for extreme cold weather and high altitudes. They featured a waterproof outer shell, insulated inner lining, and an aggressive tread pattern for better grip on snow and ice. The shoes were also lightweight, so they did not add much weight to his pack.</p>

<p>In addition to the shoes, Wim Hof also wore a pair of socks and some light gloves. The socks and gloves provided additional insulation and protection against the cold temperatures. He also had a pair of lightweight trousers to protect against the wind and snow. All in all, Wim Hof's outfit was designed to keep him warm, dry, and safe during his climb of Mt. Everest.</p>
