<p>Public health specialists are medical professionals who specialize in the prevention and control of diseases, injuries and other health issues. As such, their work is essential in protecting the public from avoidable health risks. But do they wear white coats?</p>

For example, researchers in a lab may choose to wear lab coats to protect against spills and splashes, while public health officials working in the field may opt for more casual attire. Whatever they choose to wear, public health specialists should ensure that it is comfortable and appropriate for their work environment.</p>
