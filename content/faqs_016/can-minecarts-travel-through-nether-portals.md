<p>Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game that allows players to explore, build, and create their own virtual world. One of the most iconic features of Minecraft is the Nether Portal, a mystical gateway that players can use to teleport between the Overworld and the Nether. But what about minecarts? Can minecarts travel through Nether Portals?</p>

<p>The answer is yes, minecarts can travel through Nether Portals. However, there are a few caveats that players should be aware of before attempting to do so. First, it is important to note that only certain types of minecarts can travel through Nether Portals. The two types of minecarts that are capable of traveling through Nether Portals are powered minecarts and storage minecarts.</p>

<p>Powered minecarts are the type of minecart that can be pushed or pulled by a powered rail. This type of minecart is powered by redstone and is typically used for transportation. Storage minecarts are the type of minecart that can store items, such as coal, iron, gold, and other items. These minecarts are not powered by redstone, but rather by the items that they contain.</p>

<p>When a powered minecart or storage minecart enters a Nether Portal, it will be teleported to the other side of the portal in the Overworld or the Nether. The minecart will appear on the other side of the portal in the same direction that it was going when it entered the portal. Additionally, the minecart will retain its momentum and will continue to move in the same direction it was traveling before entering the portal.</p>

<p>It should be noted that minecarts cannot travel through Ender Portals. Ender Portals are special portals that are used to travel between the Overworld and the End. Ender Portals cannot be activated by minecarts and therefore, minecarts cannot travel through them.</p>

<h2>How to Build a Nether Portal in Minecraft</h2>

<p>Building a Nether Portal in Minecraft is fairly simple. First, you will need to gather the necessary materials for the portal. These materials include obsidian blocks, which can be obtained by mining them from the Nether, and flint and steel, which can be crafted from iron and flint. Once you have the necessary materials, you will need to build the frame of the portal using the obsidian blocks. Once the frame is complete, you will need to use the flint and steel to ignite the portal and activate it.</p>

<p>Once your Nether Portal is activated, you will be able to travel between the Overworld and the Nether. Keep in mind that you can only travel through a Nether Portal if you are riding in a powered minecart or a storage minecart. If you are not riding in one of these two types of minecart, you will not be able to travel through the portal.</p>

<h2>Can You Put a Chest in a Minecart?</h2>

<p>Yes, you can put a chest in a minecart. However, only storage minecarts can hold chests. Powered minecarts cannot hold chests. It should also be noted that a chest in a minecart will not be able to hold as many items as a chest not in a minecart. This is because the chest in the minecart will take up one space, thus reducing the number of spaces available for items.</p>

<h2>Can You Put a Furnace in a Minecart?</h2>

<p>Yes, you can put a furnace in a minecart. However, only powered minecarts can hold furnaces. Storage minecarts cannot hold furnaces. Additionally, it should be noted that a furnace in a minecart will not be able to smelt as many items as a furnace not in a minecart. This is because the furnace in the minecart will take up one space, thus reducing the number of spaces available for items.</p>
