<h2>Do Rats Climb Through Windows?</h2>

Rats are not able to climb through windows with the same ease as they can climb up walls and pipes. Windows are often too narrow and slippery for rats to grip onto. Even if they manage to get their claws into the window frame, they may not be able to support their own body weight.

<h2>What Can I Do To Prevent Rats From Climbing Through My Windows?</h2>

If you want to prevent rats from climbing through your windows, there are a few steps you can take. First, make sure that your window screens are intact. If there are any gaps or tears in the screens, replace them. Second, seal any cracks or gaps around your window frames. Rats can easily squeeze through even the smallest of cracks. Finally, install metal mesh or wire mesh over your windows. This will create an impenetrable barrier that rats will not be able to climb through.

Rats are not particularly good jumpers. However, they can jump up to three feet in the air. This means that they can jump over low fences and obstacles. If you have a rat problem, it is important to check for any gaps or holes in your fence that rats could use to get into your garden.
