Ran Over a Squirrel: What to Do Next to Ease Your Guilt

When it comes to the natural world, we often forget that we are not the only species on the planet. All too often, our actions can have unintended and unfortunate consequences on the wildlife around us. This is especially true when it comes to riding a bike. Bicycles can be a great way to get around, but when we’re not careful, they can also cause destruction and tragedy.

If you’ve recently been in the unfortunate situation of running over a squirrel with your bike, you’re likely feeling a lot of guilt and remorse. It can be difficult to process these feelings and move on, so it’s important to take the time to understand what happened and what you can do next to work through the guilt.

<h2>What to Do After Accidentally Running Over a Squirrel</h2>

The first and most important thing to do after running over a squirrel is to take a few moments to assess the situation. If the squirrel appears to be unharmed, you should leave it alone and let it go about its day. If, however, it appears to be injured or in distress, you may need to take immediate action.

If you decide to help the squirrel, you should do so with caution. Even the most docile animals can become aggressive when hurt or scared. Wear thick gloves and use a piece of cloth to gently pick up the squirrel and place it in a box. If you are able to safely transport it, take it to a nearby wildlife rehabilitation center or veterinarian.

<h2>What to Do When You Feel Guilty About Running Over a Squirrel</h2>

It’s normal to experience guilt after running over a squirrel, or any other animal, with your bike. While it was an accident, there’s still a feeling of responsibility for the animal’s wellbeing.

The best way to work through these feelings is to take a step back and analyze the situation objectively. Remind yourself that accidents happen and it was not intentional. Understanding that it was an unfortunate incident that was out of your control can help to ease the guilt.

It can also be helpful to take action and do something positive to make up for the situation. If the animal was injured, you can make a donation to a wildlife rehabilitation center or volunteer your time. If the animal was not injured, you can simply be more aware of your surroundings when riding your bike and be sure to look out for animals in the future.
