<p>Corrie ten Boom was a Dutch Christian and Holocaust survivor, most famously known for her work in the Dutch Resistance during World War II. She was born in Amsterdam in 1892 and was arrested by the Gestapo in 1944 for helping Jews escape the Nazis. She was sent to the concentration camp in Ravensbrück, Germany, where she was subjected to harsh living conditions. Ten Boom spent a total of 10 months in the concentration camp before she was released in 1945. She wrote about her experiences in her book, The Hiding Place, which was published in 1971.</p>

<p>During her time in the concentration camp, Corrie ten Boom had a chance encounter with one of her former guards. She wrote about this encounter in her book and described it as a “miracle”. According to her account, she and her sister, Betsie, were called from their barracks to the office of the camp commander. When they arrived, they were shocked to see the guard who had been so cruel to them in the past. He had been promoted to the rank of camp commander and was now in charge.</p>

<p>The guard was surprised to see Corrie and Betsie and said, “You don’t recognize me, do you?” Corrie replied, “No, I don’t.” He then said, “I was the one who guarded you in the camp.” Corrie remembered him immediately and began to tremble in fear. He then said to her, “You must have forgotten all the bad things I did to you. That’s why I’m here. I have come to ask your forgiveness.”</p>

<p>The guard told Corrie that he had become a Christian and had changed his life. Corrie was moved by his story and embraced him, forgiving him for his past actions. She then told him, “There is no more hatred in my heart for you. From now on, I will pray for you every day.” The guard was so moved by Corrie’s words that he bowed his head and wept. He then said, “I will be eternally grateful for your forgiveness.”</p>

<p>After the war, Corrie and her sister returned to their home in Amsterdam. She wrote about her experiences in The Hiding Place and it became a bestselling book.
