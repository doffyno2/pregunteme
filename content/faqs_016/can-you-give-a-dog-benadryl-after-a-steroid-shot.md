Can You Give a Dog Benadryl After a Steroid Shot?



Steroids are often prescribed for dogs to help reduce inflammation and control allergies. While steroids can be very beneficial for dogs, they can also have some unwanted side effects. One common side effect of steroids is increased thirst and urination. This can lead to dehydration and urinary tract infections if not managed properly. Some pet owners may wonder if it is safe to give their dog Benadryl after a steroid shot.

<h2>Can Dogs Take Benadryl?</h2>

Benadryl, or diphenhydramine, is an antihistamine that is commonly used to treat allergies in humans. It can also be used to treat a variety of conditions in pets, including anxiety, motion sickness, allergies, and insect bites. Benadryl is generally safe for dogs, but it is important to talk to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet. The correct dosage for your pup depends on its size and weight, so it is important to get your vet’s advice before giving Benadryl.
