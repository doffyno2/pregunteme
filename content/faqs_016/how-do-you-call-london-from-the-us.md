Are you looking for a way to call London from the US? While it's not exactly a difficult task, there are some important details to consider when making international calls. From understanding the dialing codes to knowing the costs, this guide will provide you with the tips and information you need to make a successful call.

<h2>Understanding International Dialing Codes</h2>

When making an international call, you must use the international dialing code before the number you want to call. This is known as the International Direct Dial (IDD) code, and it is used to access international networks. The IDD code for the United Kingdom is +44, so you must enter +44 before the London number you are dialing. Keep in mind that if you are dialing from the US, you must add 011 before the IDD code. So, the complete dialing sequence would be 011 + 44 + the London number. 

<h2>Choosing a Carrier</h2>

There are a number of carriers available for making international calls from the US to London. Some of the most popular carriers for international calls are AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Each carrier has its own rates and fees for international calls, so it's important to compare different carriers to find the best deal. Additionally, some carriers offer special packages for international calling, so it's worth researching these in advance. 

<h2>Understanding Call Costs</h2>

When making an international call, you must be aware of the costs involved. Different carriers have different rates for international calls, and some carriers also charge a connection fee. Additionally, you may be charged for any long-distance charges incurred when connecting to the international network. It's important to check the rates and fees before making a call, and you may want to consider using a VoIP service for cheaper international calls.

<h2>Using Calling Cards</h2>

Another option for making international calls is to use a calling card. Calling cards are pre-paid cards that allow you to make calls without having to pay for the cost of the call upfront. The cards are available from most major carriers, and they can be a great way to save money on international calls. However, it's important to check the rates and fees associated with the card before making the call.

If you want to make cheap international calls, then you may want to consider using a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) service. VoIP services allow you to make calls over the Internet, and they can be a great way to save money on international calls. However, it's important to check the quality of the VoIP service before making a call, and you may also need to purchase additional hardware for the service.
