<p>When you receive an I-797C Notice of Action from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), it is important to understand what it means and how it affects your ability to travel. The I-797C Notice of Action is a form letter sent by USCIS to inform you of their decision regarding your application for immigration benefits.</p>

<p> Depending on the information provided on the form, the I-797C may indicate that the application is approved, denied, or pending further review. In some cases, it may also indicate that USCIS has requested additional evidence or that they are seeking to verify the information you have provided. In all cases, it is important to carefully read and understand the form before making any decisions about travel.</p>

<p>If your I-797C Notice of Action indicates that your application has been approved, you may be eligible to travel. However, it is important to note that the I-797C form does not provide a definitive answer as to whether or not you can travel. Other factors, such as the type of visa you have, the country you are traveling to, and the duration of your stay, must also be taken into consideration when determining if you are eligible to travel.</p>

<h2>What Should I Do if My Application is Pending?</h2>

<p>If the I-797C Notice of Action indicates that your application is pending, you should not travel until the application is approved. USCIS may need additional time to review the application and verify the information you have provided. If you travel while the application is still pending, it may be denied, and you may face significant delays in obtaining your immigration benefits.</p>

<h2>Can I Travel if My Application is Denied?</h2>

<p>If the I-797C Notice of Action indicates that your application has been denied, you should not travel. In many cases, a denied application may result in deportation or removal from the United States. If you have been denied, it is important to consult with an immigration attorney to understand your options and to determine if there are any steps you can take to avoid removal from the United States.</p>
