<p>A Peloton bike is a great way to get in shape from the comfort of your own home. But with a hefty price tag of around $2,245, it’s a significant investment. Fortunately, if you have an HSA, you may be able to use it to pay for part or all of your Peloton bike.</p>

<h2>What is an HSA?</h2>

<p>An HSA, or Health Savings Account, is a type of savings account that is specifically designed to help people pay for qualified medical expenses. An HSA is typically opened alongside a high-deductible health plan. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible, and the funds grow tax-free. When the money is used for qualified medical expenses, the funds are not subject to taxes. The money can also be withdrawn from the HSA at any time for any purpose, though there will be a penalty if it is used for anything other than medical expenses.</p>

<h2>Can I Use an HSA to Pay for a Peloton Bike?</h2>

<p>Yes, it is possible to use an HSA to pay for a Peloton bike. The IRS does not specifically list Peloton bikes as an eligible medical expense, but it does allow for the purchase of exercise equipment for medical purposes. To qualify, the exercise equipment must be prescribed by a doctor and used to treat a medical condition. For example, if you have diabetes and your doctor prescribes exercise as part of your treatment plan, you may be able to use your HSA to purchase a Peloton bike.</p>

<h2>What Other Qualified Medical Expenses Can I Pay For With My HSA?</h2>

<p>In addition to exercise equipment, there are a number of other qualified medical expenses that can be paid for with an HSA. These include doctor visits, prescription drugs, dental and vision care, hospital stays, and more. All of these expenses must be prescribed by a doctor in order to qualify.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions On How I Can Use My HSA?</h2>

Be sure to check with your HSA provider to make sure that you are using the funds correctly.</p>

For families, the maximum contribution is $7,100 per year. If you are age 55 or older, you may be eligible to make an additional catch-up contribution of up to $1,000 per year.</p>

<h2>Can I Use My HSA to Pay for Other People’s Medical Expenses?</h2>
