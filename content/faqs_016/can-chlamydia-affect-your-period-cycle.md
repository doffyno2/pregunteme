<p>Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. It is one of the most common STIs in the United States. Chlamydia is spread through sexual contact, including oral, anal, and vaginal sex. It can be spread even if there is no penetration or ejaculation.</p>
