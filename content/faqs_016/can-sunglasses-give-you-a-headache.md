Sunglasses are a fashion accessory that not only provide protection for your eyes but also make you look stylish. But did you know that wearing sunglasses can cause headaches in some people? This article will explore the causes and treatments for headaches caused by wearing sunglasses.

<h2>What Causes Headaches From Sunglasses?</h2>

Headaches caused by wearing sunglasses can have several causes. The most common cause of headaches from sunglasses is an ill-fitting pair. If the frames are too tight or the temples are too long, they can put pressure on the head and cause discomfort. This can lead to headaches, especially if they are worn for a long period of time.

Another cause of headaches from sunglasses is the tint or coating of the lenses. Some tints can cause eyestrain, which can lead to headaches. This is especially true for darker tints, which can be harder to see through and can cause the eyes to work harder.

Finally, many people are sensitive to the glare from the sun. This glare can be intensified by the lenses of sunglasses, which can cause headaches in some people.

<h2>How to Avoid Headaches From Sunglasses</h2>

The best way to avoid headaches from sunglasses is to make sure you buy a pair that fits properly. Make sure the frames are not too tight or too loose, and that the temples are not too long or too short. You should also make sure you buy lenses with a tint that is comfortable for your eyes.

If you are sensitive to glare, you may want to opt for polarized lenses. Polarized lenses reduce glare, which can help reduce eyestrain and headaches. You can also purchase sunglasses with anti-reflective coating, which can reduce glare even further.

Finally, if you find yourself getting headaches from wearing sunglasses, you may want to try wearing a hat instead. This can help shade your eyes from the sun and reduce glare, which can help reduce the risk of headaches.

<h2>Treating Headaches From Sunglasses</h2>

If you do get a headache from wearing sunglasses, there are a few things you can do to help. First, make sure you take a break from wearing the sunglasses. Removing them for a few hours can help reduce the pressure on your head and provide some relief.

If the headache persists, you may want to try an over-the-counter pain reliever. This can help reduce the pain and discomfort associated with the headache.

Finally, if the headaches continue, you should consider seeing a doctor. Your doctor may be able to recommend treatments, such as prescription glasses or contact lenses, that can help reduce the pressure on your head.
