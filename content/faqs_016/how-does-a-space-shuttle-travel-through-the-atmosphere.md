<p>A space shuttle is a spacecraft launched by an expendable rocket. It is designed to transport astronauts and material into space and return them safely to Earth. A space shuttle is propelled by a combination of several different types of engines, and it must be able to travel through the atmosphere in order to reach its destination. In order to do this, the shuttle must use a combination of several different types of propulsion, including thrust from the main engines, reaction control thrusters, and aerodynamic forces.</p>

<h2>Main Engines</h2>

<p>The main engines of a space shuttle are its primary thrust source, providing the power needed to propel it through the atmosphere. The main engines are liquid-fueled rocket engines, burning two types of fuel: liquid oxygen, and a hydrocarbon fuel such as kerosene or RP-1. The engines are mounted on the shuttle's main body, and they produce a tremendous amount of thrust, typically 6 to 7 million newtons (1.3 to 1.6 million pounds of thrust).</p>

<h2>Reaction Control Thrusters</h2>

<p>Reaction control thrusters are small thrusters mounted on the shuttle's exterior. They are used for fine-tuning its orientation and attitude, and for providing additional thrust in order to accelerate or decelerate the craft. The thrusters are powered by a combination of nitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine, and they are capable of producing up to 4,000 newtons (900 pounds) of thrust.</p>

<h2>Aerodynamic Forces</h2>

<p>As the shuttle flies through the atmosphere, the air resistance (drag) will affect its speed and trajectory. The shuttle is designed to minimize the amount of drag it experiences, in order to conserve energy and maintain a stable flight path. To do this, the shuttle's shape is designed to reduce drag, and it is also equipped with several maneuvering fins that can be used to control its attitude and orientation.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>A space shuttle must be able to travel through the atmosphere in order to reach its destination. To do this, it relies on a combination of several different types of propulsion, including thrust from its main engines, reaction control thrusters, and aerodynamic forces. By combining these different sources of propulsion, the space shuttle is able to travel safely and efficiently through the atmosphere.</p>
