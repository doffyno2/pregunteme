<p>Elite Dangerous is a space adventure game that takes players on a journey through the depths of the galaxy. Players explore, trade, and fight their way through the stars in search of fame and fortune. However, one of the most important skills in Elite Dangerous is learning how to turn faster. In this article, we'll discuss the best techniques for turning quickly and efficiently in Elite Dangerous.</p>

<h2>The Basics of Turning</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the specifics of turning faster in Elite Dangerous, it's important to understand the basics of turning in the game. When you turn in Elite Dangerous, your ship will rotate around its center of mass, while the vector of its thrust points in the direction of your desired destination. This means that if you want to turn quickly, you will need to apply a greater amount of thrust.</p>

<p>The amount of thrust you apply will depend on the type of ship you are using. Smaller ships, such as fighters, will have a much quicker turn rate than larger ships. This is because larger ships have more mass, which requires more thrust to move. You can also increase the turning rate of your ship by using boost and afterburner. Boost and afterburner will increase the thrust of your ship, allowing you to turn faster.</p>

<h2>Applying the Thruster</h2>

<p>Once you understand the basics of turning in Elite Dangerous, the next step is to learn how to apply the thruster correctly. When turning, you should always aim to keep your ship's vector pointed in the direction you want to go. This means that as you turn, your thruster should always be aimed in the direction of your desired destination. This will help ensure that your ship is turning as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>You should also be aware of the amount of thrust you are applying. If you are applying too much thrust, your ship will lose momentum and will not turn quickly. However, if you are not applying enough thrust, your ship will not turn quickly enough. You should experiment with different amounts of thrust to find the optimum turning rate for your ship.</p>

<h2>Using Afterburner and Boost</h2>

<p>As we discussed earlier, afterburner and boost can be used to increase the turning rate of your ship. Afterburner increases the thrust of your ship, while boost increases the speed of your ship. Both of these can be used to increase the turning rate of your ship.</p>

<p>When using afterburner, you should be aware of the amount of fuel you are using. Afterburner uses a lot of fuel, so you should only use it when you need to turn quickly. Boost can also be used to increase the turning rate of your ship, but it should be used sparingly as it can greatly decrease your ship's fuel efficiency.</p>

<h2>Using Manoeuvres</h2>

<p>Another technique for turning quickly in Elite Dangerous is to use manoeuvres. Manoeuvres are special techniques that can be used to quickly turn your ship. These techniques involve a combination of manoeuvring and boost, and can be used to drastically decrease your turning time.</p>

<p>Manoeuvres are best used in situations where you need to turn quickly, such as when you are being chased by an enemy or when you need to make a quick getaway. However, manoeuvres can be difficult to master and should not be attempted by inexperienced players.</p>
