<p>When it comes to caring for your beloved pet, there are a few things to keep in mind. One of those is that, yes, dogs can absorb drugs through their skin. This means that the drugs you give them, either through topical application or through pills, may be absorbed into their bloodstream and affect their health. It’s important to understand how this works and the risks associated with it. </p>

<p>It’s a well-known fact that dogs have very sensitive skin. This is one of the reasons why they can absorb drugs through their skin. When a drug is applied topically, it can be absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream. This is why it’s important to use topical medications that are specifically labeled for use on dogs. </p>

<p>There are also certain drugs that can be given to dogs orally, such as pills or liquids. While it’s unlikely that these drugs will be absorbed through the skin, they can still enter the bloodstream if they’re not taken as prescribed. It’s important to follow the instructions on the package and make sure that the dosage is correct for your pet’s size and weight. </p>

<p>Although it is possible for drugs to be absorbed through the skin, it’s important to understand that not all drugs are effective this way. Some drugs, such as antibiotics, are designed to be taken orally and won’t be effective if applied topically. It’s important to consult with your veterinarian before giving your pet any medication. </p>

<p>It’s also important to understand that some drugs can be toxic to dogs if they’re absorbed through the skin. This is why it’s essential to be aware of the risks and take precautions to protect your pet. For example, when using a topical medication, make sure to follow the directions exactly, as some drugs can be toxic if they’re used too often or in too large a dose. </p>
