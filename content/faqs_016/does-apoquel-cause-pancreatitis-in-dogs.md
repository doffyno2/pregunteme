Pancreatitis is a common condition in dogs and can be caused by a variety of different factors, including a reaction to certain medications. Many pet owners worry that Apoquel, a popular medication used to treat skin conditions in dogs, may be a possible cause of pancreatitis. In this article, we’ll take a look at the potential link between Apoquel and pancreatitis in dogs and find out if the drug could be the cause of your pup’s pancreatic issues. 

<h2>What is Apoquel?</h2>

Apoquel is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat itching, redness, and other skin issues in dogs. It is often prescribed for dogs with allergies, but can also be used to treat skin conditions such as mange, flea allergy dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. Apoquel works by blocking the release of a chemical called interleukin-31, which is responsible for the itching and inflammation associated with skin conditions. 

<h2>What is Pancreatitis?</h2>

Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, an organ located in the abdomen that produces hormones and enzymes that help digest food. In dogs, pancreatitis can be caused by a variety of different factors, including diet, certain medications, and underlying conditions such as diabetes. Symptoms of pancreatitis in dogs include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dehydration. 

<h2>What is the Link Between Apoquel and Pancreatitis?</h2>

Apoquel has been linked to an increased risk of pancreatitis in some dogs. A study conducted in 2016 found that dogs taking Apoquel were 4.5 times more likely to develop pancreatitis than dogs that were not taking the drug. However, it is important to note that the study did not prove that Apoquel caused the pancreatitis, only that there was an association between the two. 

<h2>What Should You Do if You Suspect Apoquel is Causing Pancreatitis?</h2>

If you suspect that your dog’s pancreatitis may be caused by Apoquel, it is important to contact your veterinarian right away. Your vet will be able to determine if Apoquel is indeed the cause of the pancreatitis and recommend a treatment plan for your pet. In some cases, it may be necessary to switch to a different medication to treat your dog’s skin condition. 

<h2>What Are the Alternatives to Apoquel?</h2>

If your vet decides that Apoquel is not the best treatment option for your pup, there are several alternatives that can be used to treat skin conditions in dogs. These include antihistamines, steroids, and immunosuppressants. Your vet may also recommend dietary changes, such as switching to a hypoallergenic diet, to help control your dog’s skin condition. 

<h2>Can Pancreatitis be Treated?</h2>

Yes, pancreatitis can be treated with a combination of medications and diet changes. Depending on the severity of the condition, your vet may recommend medications such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and antacids. Your vet may also recommend dietary changes such as a low-fat diet and/or a high-fiber diet. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Pancreatitis can be a serious condition in dogs, and it is important to be aware of the potential link between Apoquel and pancreatitis. If you suspect that your dog’s pancreatitis may be caused by Apoquel, it is important to contact your veterinarian right away. Your vet can help determine if the drug is the cause of the pancreatitis and recommend an appropriate treatment plan for your pup.
