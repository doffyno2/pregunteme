<p>Athena is a popular role-playing game that is played by millions of people around the world.

One of the most popular and rewarding ways to play Athena is by doing solo runs, where a single player takes on the monsters alone. But is it possible to get more reputation points by doing solo runs?</p>

There are a few things to keep in mind when doing solo runs, such as your level, the monsters you choose to fight, and how many monsters you choose to fight. By taking on the right monsters and using the right strategies, you can earn more reputation points than you would if you were playing with a full team.</p>
