Sea otters are unique in that they have the densest fur of any animal, with up to 900,000 hairs per square inch. Their fur helps to keep them warm in the cold ocean waters and is an important part of their lives. Sea otters have webbed feet and streamlined bodies that help them to swim quickly and efficiently.

Sea otters are carnivorous and eat a variety of foods. They primarily feed on mollusks, such as clams and mussels, but they also eat crabs, sea urchins, squid, and a variety of fish species. They use rocks to crack open the shells of their prey, and will sometimes use their chest as an anvil to break open the shells.

Sea otters are also known for their use of tools. They will often use rocks to help them open the shells of their prey, and have been known to use pieces of kelp as an anchor when eating.
