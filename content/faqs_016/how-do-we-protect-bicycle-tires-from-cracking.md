<p>Bicycle tires are the most important part of any bicycle. Without them, your bicycle would be unable to move. Thus, it is important to keep them in good condition in order to avoid any potential damage. Unfortunately, bicycle tires can be prone to cracking due to a variety of factors such as age, weather, and usage. In this article, we will discuss how to protect bicycle tires from cracking and what you can do to prevent it from happening in the first place.</p>

<h2>What Causes Bicycle Tires to Crack?</h2>

<p>Bicycle tires can crack for a number of reasons including age, weather, and usage. The most common cause of bicycle tire cracks is age. As bicycle tires age, they become more prone to cracking due to the natural breakdown of their rubber material. Additionally, exposure to extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat or cold can cause bicycle tires to crack, as the rubber is unable to handle the stress of the environment. Finally, overusing bicycle tires can also cause them to crack, as the tires may be forced to stretch beyond their normal limits. </p>

This includes regularly inspecting your tires for any signs of wear or damage, checking for proper tire pressure, and replacing worn out tires when needed. Additionally, it is important to store your bicycle in a cool, dry place when not in use to prevent your tires from becoming exposed to extreme temperatures. Finally, make sure you are not overusing your tires, as this can cause them to stretch beyond their normal limits, leading to cracks.</p>

This is because cracked tires are more prone to punctures and other damage, which could lead to serious injury or death. Additionally, cracked tires may cause your bicycle to be unstable, making it difficult to control. When replacing your tires, make sure you select the correct size and type of tire for your bicycle. Additionally, make sure you use a high-quality tire that is designed to last.</p>
