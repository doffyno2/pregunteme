<p>Wiffle balls are a type of soft plastic ball used for a variety of sports and games, particularly baseball and other batting sports. They are relatively inexpensive and easy to use, making them a popular choice for backyard and recreational play. But how big is a wiffle ball?</p>

<p>Wiffle balls are generally about 8 inches in circumference. This is a little smaller than a regulation baseball, which is 9 inches in circumference. The ball is also slightly lighter than a regulation baseball, weighing in at around 3.2 ounces. This difference in size and weight makes the wiffle ball much easier to hit, allowing for more control and accuracy. </p>

<p>The wiffle ball is also hollow, with eight oblong slots cut into the plastic. This unique design allows the ball to move through the air more quickly and with more spin than a regulation baseball. This makes the ball more difficult to hit, but also more unpredictable and exciting. </p>

<p>The wiffle ball also has a flexible plastic core and a durable, perforated plastic shell. This combination makes the ball more resistant to breaking and helps it maintain its shape during and after long hours of play. </p>
