<p>Southwest Airlines is one of the most popular airlines in the United States, and with good reason. They offer some of the best customer service in the business, as well as a comfortable travel experience. But, how big are Southwest seats?</p>

<p>Southwest has a variety of aircraft models in their fleet, and the size of their seats varies depending on the model. In general, though, Southwest seats measure 17-18 inches in width, and the pitch (the distance from one row of seats to the next) ranges from 31-33 inches. That means that there's plenty of leg room for most passengers, and even taller passengers should be able to find a comfortable fit for their journey.</p>

<p>Of course, the size of the seat also depends on the type of aircraft. For example, the Boeing 737-800 has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while the 737-700 has a seat pitch of 33 inches. The 737-700 also has a wider seat width of 18 inches, compared to the 17 inch width of the 737-800. Similarly, the Airbus A320 has a seat pitch of 31 inches and a width of 17 inches, while the A321 has a seat pitch of 33 inches and a width of 18 inches.</p>

<p>When it comes to comfort, Southwest seats are generally considered to be on par with other airlines. They are well-padded and provide plenty of leg room for most passengers. However, keep in mind that Southwest does not offer reclining seats, so if you're looking for extra space and comfort, you may want to look into other airlines.</p>

<p>Southwest also offers a variety of seating options, including extra-legroom seats, exit-row seats, and even pet-friendly seating. Extra-legroom seats offer up to four extra inches of legroom and are available for an additional fee. Exit-row seats are available for no additional fee, but you must be at least 15 years old to sit in them. And if you're traveling with a pet, you can purchase a pet-friendly seat that offers plenty of space for your pet to stretch out.</p>

<h2>What Are Southwest's Seating Policies?</h2>

<p>Southwest has a few policies that passengers should be aware of when it comes to seating. For one, they offer free same-day standby on flights. This means that if you'd like to switch to an earlier or later flight on the same day, you can do so without any additional cost. However, keep in mind that you must check-in at least 45 minutes before your original flight's scheduled departure time.</p>

<p>Southwest also offers EarlyBird Check-In for an additional fee. This allows passengers to check in up to 36 hours before their flight's scheduled departure time, which allows them to select the best available seats. If you're traveling with a companion, you can also purchase two EarlyBird Check-In tickets for a discounted fee.</p>

<p>Finally, Southwest also offers a complimentary seating option that allows passengers to select their own seats at check-in. This means that passengers can select any available seat on the plane, provided that it is available at check-in. This is a great way to ensure that you get the seat that you want, but keep in mind that the complimentary seating option is subject to availability.</p>
