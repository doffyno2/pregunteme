Have you ever been in a situation where you can't repair your ship in No Man's Sky (NMS)? It's a frustrating experience, especially when you're trying to make progress. Luckily, there are some solutions that may help you get back on track. In this article, we'll explain what you can do when you can't repair your ship in NMS.

<h2>What Causes the Problem?</h2>

There are several different causes for the inability to repair your ship in NMS. First, the game may be experiencing technical difficulties. If the game is running slow or experiencing crashes, it may prevent you from being able to repair your ship. Additionally, certain bugs or glitches may cause the game to be unresponsive when you attempt to repair your ship.

Another cause of the problem could be a lack of resources. In NMS, you need resources to repair your ship. If you don't have enough resources, you won't be able to repair your ship.

<h2>How to Fix the Problem?</h2>

If you're having trouble repairing your ship in NMS, there are several potential solutions you can try.

<h3>Restart the Game</h3>

The first step is to restart the game. This can help if the game is experiencing technical difficulties or if there are bugs or glitches causing the problem. Restarting the game can also help if you don't have enough resources to repair your ship.

<h3>Check for Updates</h3>

If restarting the game doesn't help, you should check for updates. Updates can fix technical issues, as well as provide new resources that can help you repair your ship.

<h3>Get More Resources</h3>

If you don't have enough resources to repair your ship, you'll need to get more. You can do this by mining, trading with other players, or looking for free resources on the galactic map.

<h3>Create a New Save File</h3>

If none of the above solutions work, you may need to create a new save file. This will reset your progress in the game, but it may be the only way to repair your ship.
