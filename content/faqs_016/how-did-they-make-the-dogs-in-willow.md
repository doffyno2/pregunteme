The iconic fantasy adventure movie Willow was a groundbreaking film in 1988, introducing audiences to a world of magic and adventure. One of the most impressive effects of the movie was the transformation of a small dog into a huge, vicious monster. The transformation scene was so realistic that audiences were left wondering how they did it. In this article, we'll take a look at the behind the scenes production of Willow and explore how the filmmakers achieved the jaw-dropping dog transformation. 

<h2>The Story Behind The Transformation</h2>

The story of Willow begins with the main character, a Nelwyn farmer named Willow Ufgood (played by Warwick Davis). He is tasked with protecting a baby girl from an evil queen who wants to take over the kingdom. To help him on his quest, he is joined by a group of misfit adventurers and a magical dog named Eborsisk. As the story progresses, the dog is captured by the queenâ€™s sorcerer and transformed into a huge, vicious monster. 

<h2>How They Achieved The Transformation</h2>

The transformation of a small dog into a huge monster was achieved through a combination of practical effects and stop motion animation. The filmmakers used a life-size puppet of the monster and a small puppet of the dog. The life-size puppet was then operated by puppeteers and the small puppet was animated using stop motion technology. This allowed the filmmakers to create the illusion of a monster transforming from a small dog into a huge beast. 

<h2>The Puppets Used In The Transformation</h2>

The life-size puppet of the monster was created by special effects artist Phil Tippett. Tippett used foam rubber and latex to create the puppet, which was then outfitted with animatronic parts. The smaller puppet of the dog was created by stop motion animator David Allen. The puppet was constructed out of foam rubber, latex, and wire and was then animated using stop motion techniques. 

<h2>The Puppeteers Behind The Scenes</h2>

The transformation scene from Willow was created by a team of puppeteers. The team included special effects artist Phil Tippett and stop motion animator David Allen. Tippett operated the life-size puppet of the monster and Allen operated the small puppet of the dog. The puppeteers worked together to create the illusion of a transformation from a small dog into a huge beast. 

<h2>The Final Transformation</h2>

The final transformation scene from Willow is a stunning feat of practical effects and stop motion animation. The combination of the life-size puppet of the monster and the small puppet of the dog allowed the filmmakers to create an incredibly realistic and believable transformation scene. Audiences were left awestruck by the amazing effects of the movie and the incredible transformation of a small dog into a huge, vicious monster.
