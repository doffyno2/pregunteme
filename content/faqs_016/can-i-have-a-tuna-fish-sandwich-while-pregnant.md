<p>Pregnancy is an exciting time, but it can also be a confusing one. Expectant mothers need to be extra careful with their diet and health during this time, and they often have many questions, including whether or not they can have a tuna fish sandwich while pregnant. The answer is - it depends.</p>

<h2>Potential Risks of Eating Tuna Fish While Pregnant</h2>

<p>Tuna fish is a high-protein food, but it is also high in mercury. Exposure to mercury can have serious consequences on the development of the unborn baby. In pregnant women, high levels of mercury can lead to an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and even developmental delays. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pregnant women and women who may become pregnant limit their consumption of tuna fish, especially albacore tuna.</p>

<p>The FDA also recommends that pregnant women limit their intake of canned light tuna to 12 ounces (340 grams) per week. It is also important to note that tuna steak typically contains more mercury than canned light tuna, and should be avoided altogether by pregnant women.</p>

<h2>Is Canned Tuna Safe to Eat During Pregnancy?</h2>

<p>Canned light tuna is generally considered safe to eat during pregnancy, as long as it is consumed in moderation. Canned light tuna is lower in mercury than other types of tuna, so it is a better option for pregnant women. When choosing canned tuna, look for brands that are labeled as "low-mercury" or "light."</p>

<p>It is important to note that there are other potential risks associated with canned tuna. Some canned tuna can contain high levels of histamine, which can cause an allergic reaction in some people. It is also important to check the label for any potential allergens, such as soy or wheat.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Tuna Fish While Pregnant </h2>

<p>If you are pregnant and want to get the protein and other nutritional benefits of fish, there are some alternatives to tuna that are safer to eat. Some examples include salmon, trout, sardines, and herring. These fish are generally lower in mercury than tuna, and can be a healthy part of a pregnancy diet.</p>

<p>It is also important to get the recommended daily amount of omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for the development of the baby’s brain and eyes. If you are avoiding tuna while pregnant, you can get omega-3 fatty acids from other sources, such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Tuna fish can be a healthy part of a pregnancy diet, as long as it is consumed in moderation. The FDA recommends that pregnant women limit their intake of canned light tuna to 12 ounces (340 grams) per week. It is also important to check the label for any potential allergens, and to look for brands that are labeled as "low-mercury" or "light."
