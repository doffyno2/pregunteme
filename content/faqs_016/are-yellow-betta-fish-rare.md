<h2>What Are Yellow Betta Fish?</h2>

<p>Betta fish are one of the most popular aquarium fish, and they come in a variety of colors, from bright blues and reds to subtle yellows. Yellow betta fish are a rare color variant of the species, and they are prized for their bright, sunny color. Yellow betta fish have become increasingly popular in recent years, and there are now numerous types of yellow betta fish available for sale.</p>

<h2>What Makes Yellow Betta Fish Rare?</h2>

<p>Yellow betta fish are relatively rare because they are a mutation of the standard blue or red betta fish. This mutation is caused by the presence of a gene that codes for the production of a yellow pigment in the fish’s scales. The gene is recessive, meaning that it must be inherited from both parents in order for the yellow color to be expressed in the offspring. As a result, breeding two yellow betta fish together is not guaranteed to produce yellow offspring.</p>

<p>Additionally, yellow betta fish are often harder to come by than other colors, as the demand for them is relatively low. As a result, many fish stores may not carry yellow betta fish, or may only have a few in stock. If you’re looking for a yellow betta fish, it’s best to do your research and find a reputable breeder who specializes in this color.</p>
