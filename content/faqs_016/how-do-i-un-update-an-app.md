<p>In the modern digital age, we rely heavily on apps for a variety of tasks. Whether it’s for business or pleasure, we can find an app to help us out with pretty much anything. As a result, it’s not uncommon to find yourself with dozens of apps installed on your device. Unfortunately, many users run into issues when it comes to un-updating or reverting an app to a previous version. So, if you’re in a situation where you’re trying to figure out how to un-update an app, this guide is for you.</p>

<h2>Why Would You Un-update an App?</h2>

<p>There are a few reasons why you might want to un-update an app. The most common reason is that the newest version of the app is riddled with bugs and crashes. This is a problem that many users run into, especially with apps that don’t receive regular updates. In these cases, you might find that the older version of the app works better than the newest version.</p>

<p>Another common reason to un-update an app is if you’re trying to access a feature that has been removed from the latest version of the app. This is also a problem that many users face, as many app developers remove features from their apps without warning. Fortunately, you can often access these features by un-updating the app.</p>

<h2>How to Un-update an App on Android</h2>

<p>If you’re using an Android device, un-updating an app is relatively easy. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the Google Play Store on your device.</li>
  <li>Tap the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner of the screen and select “My apps & games” from the menu.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to the “Installed” section and tap the app you want to un-update.</li>
  <li>Tap “Uninstall” and confirm that you want to uninstall the app.</li>
  <li>Once the app is uninstalled, open the Play Store again and search for the app.</li>
  <li>Tap the “Install” button and the app will be reinstalled. It will be the old version of the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that you won’t be able to un-update an app if it hasn’t been updated in a while. If the app hasn’t been updated in months or years, then you won’t be able to un-update it.</p>

<h2>How to Un-update an App on iOS</h2>

<p>The process of un-updating an app on an iOS device is slightly different than on Android. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the App Store on your device.</li>
  <li>Tap your profile icon in the upper-right corner of the screen and select “Purchased” from the menu.</li>
  <li>Tap “All” and then find the app you want to un-update.</li>
  <li>Tap the “Download” button and the app will be reinstalled. It will be the old version of the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike on Android, you can’t uninstall an app on iOS. The only way to un-update an app is to download the old version. This means that you won’t be able to un-update an app if it hasn’t been updated in a while.</p>
