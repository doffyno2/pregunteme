<p>Though it may sound like a strange question, many pet owners have asked if it’s safe for their pup to consume cardboard. After all, dogs are curious creatures and will often try to eat anything that catches their eye. But can dogs eat cardboard, or is it a bad idea?</p>

<p>The short answer is no, dogs should not eat cardboard. Like with many other items, cardboard can be dangerous for dogs to consume. It can be difficult for a dog’s digestive system to break down, and it can lead to choking or other health issues. Eating cardboard can also be a sign of a more serious underlying medical problem, so it’s important to speak to your vet right away if your pup is eating cardboard.</p>

In addition, cardboard can contain chemicals such as formaldehyde and zinc, which can be toxic to dogs if consumed in large quantities. Cardboard can also contain sharp edges that can cut a dog’s gums or throat if ingested.</p>
