<p>A corroded zipper is an all too common problem, but the good news is that it’s something that can be fixed. Whether you’re dealing with a corroded zipper on a pair of jeans, a coat, or a piece of furniture, the same repair techniques can be used. Read on to find out how to fix a corroded zipper and get it working like new again.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Corroded Zipper?</h2>

<p>Corroded zippers are caused by a buildup of rust and dirt, which can happen when metal zippers come into contact with water, sweat, or other liquids. The metal can also corrode due to salt or acid in the environment, or simply from age. In any case, a corroded zipper will be difficult to open and close, and can even get stuck in the fabric.</p>

<h2>How to Fix a Corroded Zipper</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Clean the Zipper</h3>

<p>The first step in fixing a corroded zipper is to clean it. Start by using a dry cloth to wipe away any dirt and grime on the zipper. Then, use a cotton swab or cloth with some rubbing alcohol or vinegar to remove any rust or corrosion from the metal.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Lubricate the Zipper</h3>

<p>Once the zipper is clean, you’ll need to lubricate it to make sure it slides smoothly. Use a lubricant specifically made for zippers, such as WD-40, or a lubricant specifically made for outdoor use such as Vaseline or beeswax. Apply the lubricant to the zipper teeth and the pull tab and then open and close the zipper several times to make sure it slides smoothly.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Replace the Pull Tab</h3>

<p>If the pull tab is damaged or corroded, it’s best to replace it. This can be done easily by removing the old tab and replacing it with a new one. Make sure that the new pull tab is the same size and material as the old one. Once the new pull tab is in place, lubricate it to make sure it slides easily.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Test the Zipper</h3>

<p>Once the zipper is clean and lubricated, it’s time to test it. Open and close the zipper several times to make sure it slides smoothly. If it doesn’t, try adding more lubricant and testing again. If it still doesn’t work, the zipper may need to be replaced.</p>
