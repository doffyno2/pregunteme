<p>Fish and shellfish are two very different types of seafood, but they can cause serious allergic reactions in some people. If you’re allergic to shellfish, you may wonder if it’s safe to eat fish. The short answer is yes, it is safe for people with a shellfish allergy to eat fish.</p> 

<p>Fish and shellfish are both aquatic animals, but they’re from two different classes of animals. Fish are from the class Osteichthyes, while shellfish are from the class Crustacea. This means that fish and shellfish have completely different proteins, and people with a shellfish allergy won’t necessarily be allergic to fish.</p> 

<p>However, it’s important to note that some people with a shellfish allergy may also be allergic to fish. This is known as cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity occurs when a person’s immune system mistakes proteins found in fish for the proteins found in shellfish. If you’re allergic to shellfish, it’s important to understand your risk of having a fish allergy, too.</p>

<h2>What Are the Symptoms of a Fish Allergy?</h2>

<p>The symptoms of a fish allergy are similar to those of any other food allergy. Common symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hives or a skin rash</li>
  <li>Itching or tingling in the mouth</li>
  <li>Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, and throat</li>
  <li>Wheezing, trouble breathing, or shortness of breath</li>
  <li>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</li>
  <li>Dizziness or fainting</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, a fish allergy can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction that can cause difficulty breathing and other severe symptoms.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing a Fish Allergy</h2>

<p>If you think you may have a fish allergy, it’s important to see an allergist. An allergist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating allergies. To diagnose a fish allergy, your allergist will likely perform a physical exam and review your medical history.</p>

<p>Your allergist may also recommend a skin prick test or a blood test. Skin prick tests involve pricking your skin with a tiny amount of the allergen and then monitoring your skin for a reaction. A blood test measures the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in your blood. This test can help your allergist determine if you have an allergy to a certain type of fish.</p>

<h2>Treating a Fish Allergy</h2>

<p>If you’re allergic to fish, the best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid fish and fish products altogether. It’s important to read food labels carefully, as fish and shellfish are often hidden ingredients in many foods.</p>

<p>Your allergist may also recommend taking an antihistamine or a corticosteroid to reduce your risk of an allergic reaction. In some cases, your allergist may recommend immunotherapy (allergy shots). Immunotherapy involves receiving a series of shots that contain tiny amounts of the allergen. Over time, your body will build up a tolerance to the allergen.</p>
