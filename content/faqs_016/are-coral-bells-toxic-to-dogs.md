<p>Coral bells, also known as Heuchera and Alum Root, are a popular garden plant that can be found in many gardens across the country. These plants are known for their colorful foliage, which can range from shades of green to purple and even red. They are easy to care for, and they can be found in a variety of sizes and shapes. But, an important question that many pet owners have is whether these plants are toxic to dogs. </p>

<p>The good news is that, generally speaking, coral bells are not toxic to dogs. However, there are some exceptions, so it is important to research the specific variety of coral bells you have in your garden to make sure they are not hazardous to your pet. In addition, it is important to be aware of any potential risks associated with coral bells and take the necessary precautions. </p>

<h2>Are All Varieties of Coral Bells Non-Toxic to Dogs?</h2>

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) lists several varieties of coral bells, including Alum Root (Heuchera americana), Coral Bells (Heuchera sanguinea), and False Alum Root (Heuchera micrantha), as being toxic to dogs. These plants contain saponins, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and other digestive upset if ingested by dogs. </p>

<p>It is important to note, however, that the toxic effects of coral bells are not usually severe and generally only occur if a large amount of the plant is ingested.

For example, the foliage of coral bells can be sharp and can cause cuts and scrapes if touched or brushed against.

<p>To minimize the risks associated with coral bells, it is important to regularly inspect the plants for signs of disease or pests and to keep them away from areas where children or pets may come into contact with them. </p>

<h2>How Can I Keep My Dog Safe Around Coral Bells?</h2>
