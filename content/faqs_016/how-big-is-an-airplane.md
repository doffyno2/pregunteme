<p>An airplane, or aeroplane, is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes and wing configurations. The size of an airplane is typically measured in terms of its wingspan, or the length of its fuselage, or the height of its tail fin. </p>

<h2>What is the Average Wingspan of an Airplane?</h2>

<p>The average wingspan of an airplane is between 33 and 36 feet. The wingspan of a passenger jet is typically between 95 and 125 feet. This measurement is taken from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. Wingspans of military aircraft can be much larger, up to 200 feet. </p>

<h2>How Long is an Airplane's Fuselage?</h2>

<p>The fuselage of an airplane is the main body of the aircraft, which houses the passengers, cargo and engine. The length of the fuselage is typically measured from the nose to the tail. The average length of a commercial airliner is between 110 and 130 feet, while the average length of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 30 and 50 feet. </p>

<h2>What is the Average Height of an Airplane's Tail Fin?</h2>

<p>The tail fin of an airplane is the vertical surface at the rear of the fuselage that provides stability in flight. The average height of a tail fin is between 10 and 15 feet. Some larger aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, have tail fins that are over 20 feet tall. </p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is the Largest Airplane?</h3>
<p>The Antonov An-225 Mriya is the largest airplane ever built. It has a wingspan of 290 feet and a fuselage length of 275 feet. The Antonov An-225 is primarily used for transporting oversized payloads.</p>

<h3>How Much Does an Airplane Weigh?</h3>
<p>The weight of an airplane varies depending on its size and type. The average weight of a commercial airliner is between 200,000 and 300,000 pounds, while the average weight of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 5,000 and 15,000 pounds.</p>

<h3>How Fast Can an Airplane Fly?</h3>
<p>The speed of an airplane varies depending on its type and size. The average speed of a commercial airliner is between 500 and 600 miles per hour, while the average speed of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 100 and 200 miles per hour.</p>

<h3>What is the Range of an Airplane?</h3>
<p>The range of an airplane is the maximum distance it can fly before needing to refuel. The average range of a commercial airliner is between 3,000 and 5,000 miles, while the average range of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 500 and 1,000 miles.</p>

<h3>What is the Ceiling of an Airplane?</h3>
<p>The ceiling of an airplane is the maximum altitude it can reach before losing lift and stalling. The average ceiling of a commercial airliner is between 40,000 and 45,000 feet, while the average ceiling of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 10,000 and 20,000 feet.</p>

<h3>How Many Passengers Does an Airplane Hold?</h3>
<p>The number of passengers an airplane can hold varies depending on its size and type. The average number of passengers a commercial airliner can hold is between 100 and 400, while the average number of passengers a small or mid-sized aircraft can hold is between 1 and 10.</p>

<h3>How Much Fuel Does an Airplane Use?</h3>
<p>The amount of fuel an airplane uses depends on its size and type. The average fuel consumption of a commercial airliner is between 10,000 and 15,000 gallons per hour, while the average fuel consumption of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 1,000 and 5,000 gallons per hour.</p>

<h3>What is the Lifespan of an Airplane?</h3>
<p>The lifespan of an airplane depends on its size and type. The average lifespan of a commercial airliner is between 20 and 30 years, while the average lifespan of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 10 and 15 years.</p>

<h3>How Many Engines Does an Airplane Have?</h3>
<p>The number of engines an airplane has depends on its size and type. The average number of engines a commercial airliner has is between two and four, while the average number of engines a small or mid-sized aircraft has is between one and two.</p>

<h3>How Much Does an Airplane Cost?</h3>
<p>The cost of an airplane varies depending on its size and type. The average cost of a commercial airliner is between $80 million and $150 million, while the average cost of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between $50,000 and $1 million.</p>

<h3>What is the Maximum Altitude an Airplane Can Fly?</h3>
<p>The maximum altitude an airplane can fly is limited by its ceiling, which varies depending on its size and type. The average ceiling of a commercial airliner is between 40,000 and 45,000 feet, while the average ceiling of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 10,000 and 20,000 feet.</p>

<h3>What is the Maximum Speed an Airplane Can Fly?</h3>
<p>The maximum speed an airplane can fly is limited by its engine power and aerodynamic characteristics. The average speed of a commercial airliner is between 500 and 600 miles per hour, while the average speed of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 100 and 200 miles per hour.</p>

<h3>What is the Maximum Takeoff Weight of an Airplane?</h3>
<p>The maximum takeoff weight of an airplane is limited by its structure, engines and fuel capacity. The average maximum takeoff weight of a commercial airliner is between 350,000 and 500,000 pounds, while the average maximum takeoff weight of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 5,000 and 15,000 pounds.</p>

<h3>What is the Maximum Payload of an Airplane?</h3>
<p>The maximum payload of an airplane is the total weight of its passengers, cargo and fuel. The average maximum payload of a commercial airliner is between 80,000 and 120,000 pounds, while the average maximum payload of a small or mid-sized aircraft is between 1,000 and 5,000 pounds.</p>

<h3>What is the Maximum Range of an Airplane?</h3>
