<p>When it comes to fish keeping, one of the most important questions that you need to ask yourself is whether or not you can have 28 fish in a 36 gallon tank. This is an important question to ask because if you put too many fish in a small tank, it can be dangerous for both the fish and the tank itself. In this article, we will look at the factors to consider before adding 28 fish to a 36 gallon tank.</p>

<h2>Factors to Consider Before Adding 28 Fish to a 36 Gallon Tank</h2>

<p>There are several factors to consider before adding 28 fish to a 36 gallon tank. These factors include the type of fish, the size of the fish, the water temperature, and the type of filtration system. It is important to take these factors into account before you make any decisions about adding more fish to your tank.</p>

<h3>Type of Fish</h3>

<p>The type of fish is an important factor to consider when adding 28 fish to a 36 gallon tank. Some fish require more space than others, so it is important to do your research and choose the right fish for your tank. If you are planning on adding 28 fish to a 36 gallon tank, it is best to choose smaller fish such as tetras, guppies, or rasboras.</p>

<h3>Size of Fish</h3>

<p>The size of the fish is also an important factor to consider when adding 28 fish to a 36 gallon tank. If the fish are too large, they will not be able to move around comfortably and they may not be able to find enough food. It is important to choose fish that are the right size for the tank to ensure they have enough room to move and enough food to eat.</p>

<h3>Water Temperature</h3>

<p>The water temperature is also an important factor to consider when adding 28 fish to a 36 gallon tank. Different fish have different temperature requirements, so it is important to research the temperature requirements for the fish you are planning to add. If the water temperature is too high or too low, the fish may not survive.</p>

<h3>Filtration System</h3>

<p>The type of filtration system is also an important factor to consider when adding 28 fish to a 36 gallon tank. It is important to choose a filtration system that is large enough and powerful enough to clean the water and keep the tank healthy. If the filtration system is not large enough or powerful enough, the tank may not remain clean and the fish may become sick.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it is possible to have 28 fish in a 36 gallon tank, but it is important to consider the type of fish, the size of the fish, the water temperature, and the type of filtration system before adding them. If you take these factors into account, you will be able to add 28 fish to your 36 gallon tank safely and successfully.</p>
