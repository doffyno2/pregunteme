  <li><b>Your Current Medications:</b> Your doctor will need to know what medications you are currently taking in order to ensure that the chest X-ray will not interfere with any of them.</li>
  <li><b>Allergies:</b> If you have any allergies, it is important to let your doctor know so that they can take the necessary precautions to ensure your safety and comfort during the procedure.</li>
