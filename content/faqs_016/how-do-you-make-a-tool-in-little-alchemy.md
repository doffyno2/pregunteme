<h2>What is a Tool?</h2>

<p>A tool is an object that is used to assist in completing a task. In Little Alchemy, tools are used to help the player craft new elements or speed up the process of gathering materials. The type of tool you can craft depends on the type of element you are trying to create. For example, if you are trying to create a metal element, you may need to craft a hammer or an anvil. If you are creating a fire element, you may need to craft a flint and steel.</p>

<h2>What Materials Do You Need?</h2>

<p>Before you can craft a tool in Little Alchemy, you will need to gather the necessary materials. Depending on the type of tool you are trying to craft, you will need different materials. For example, if you are trying to craft a hammer, you will need a metal, a handle, and some cloth. If you are trying to craft an anvil, you will need a metal, a handle, and some clay.</p>

<h2>How to Craft a Tool</h2>

Once you have selected the tool, you can use it to create the element you have chosen. Depending on the type of tool you have crafted, you may need to use it in different ways. For example, if you have crafted a hammer, you may need to hit the element with it in order to create it. If you have crafted an anvil, you may need to place the element on top of the anvil and then hit it with a hammer in order to create it.</p>

<h2>Using the Tool to Create New Elements</h2>
