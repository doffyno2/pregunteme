For many years, Druid players in the World of Warcraft have enjoyed the ability to travel in their Travel Form, which enables them to move faster than walking and also provides some defensive boosts as well. During this time, they were also able to use their Travel Form to farm resources, such as herbs and ore, from resource nodes in the game world. This has been a popular way for players to make money in the game, and it has been enjoyed by many players for a very long time.

However, in recent years, the ability to farm in Travel Form has been removed from the game. This has caused a great deal of confusion and frustration among players, who have been accustomed to using Travel Form to farm for many years. In this article, we will look at why the ability to farm in Travel Form has been removed, as well as what players can do to continue making money in the game without relying on Travel Form.

<h2>Why Was the Ability to Farm in Travel Form Removed?</h2>

The primary reason that the ability to farm in Travel Form was removed is because it was seen as an exploit of the game's mechanics. Unlike other forms of travel, such as flying mounts, Travel Form enables players to move much faster than they would normally be able to while in the game world. This can be used to bypass certain areas of the game world, and it can also be used to quickly travel between resource nodes. 

This means that players can farm resources significantly faster than they would be able to if they had to travel in the normal way. This can lead to an unfair advantage for players who are able to make use of Travel Form to farm resources. As such, Blizzard has chosen to remove the ability to farm in Travel Form in order to maintain a level playing field.

<h2>What Can Players Do to Make Money Without Travel Form?</h2>

Players who are used to using Travel Form to farm resources may be feeling frustrated and confused by the recent change. However, there are still plenty of ways for players to make money in the game without relying on Travel Form. One of the most popular ways is to make use of the Auction House, which allows players to buy and sell items for a profit. 

Players can also make money by completing quests and dungeons, which reward players with in-game currency and items. Finally, players can also make money by crafting items and then selling them on the Auction House. All of these methods are viable ways for players to make money in the game, and they can be used to supplement the income that players would have made from farming in Travel Form.
