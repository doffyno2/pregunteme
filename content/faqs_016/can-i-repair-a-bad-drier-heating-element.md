<p>Dryers can seem to have a mind of their own sometimes. When a dryer stops heating, it can be a sign of a bad heating element. In some cases, the heating element can be repaired, but in other cases, it may be necessary to replace the entire heating element. Understanding the signs of a bad heating element and what can be done to repair it can save time, money, and frustration.</p>

<h2>Signs of a Bad Dryer Heating Element</h2>

<p>The first signs of a bad heating element are usually the dryer not heating at all, or not heating enough. If the dryer is not heating up at all, then the heating element is likely bad and needs to be replaced. If the dryer is not heating up enough, the heating element may still be functional, but could need to be replaced. Other signs of a bad heating element include the dryer not drying clothes properly, clothes being too hot when they come out of the dryer, or the dryer becoming too hot to touch.</p>

<h2>How to Test a Dryer Heating Element</h2>

<p>Before attempting to replace the heating element, it is important to test it to ensure it is the cause of the problem. To test the heating element, use a multimeter to check the continuity of the heating element. If the multimeter reads zero or no continuity, then the heating element is bad and needs to be replaced. If the continuity is good, then the problem may lie elsewhere.</p>

<h2>How to Replace a Dryer Heating Element</h2>

<p>Replacing a dryer heating element is a relatively simple process. First, unplug the dryer from the wall and shut off the power to the dryer. Next, remove the back panel of the dryer and locate the heating element. Remove the screws that hold the heating element in place and then unplug the wiring from the element. Carefully remove the element from the dryer and install the new element in its place. Reattach the wires to the element and then replace the screws to secure the element. Finally, replace the back panel and plug the dryer back in.</p>
