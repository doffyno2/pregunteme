It may be tempting to reach for a glass of water after a delicious fish dinner, but there are good reasons why you should avoid drinking water after eating fish. In this article, we’ll explore why you should never drink water after eating fish and the potential consequences of doing so.

<h2>What Happens When You Drink Water After Eating Fish?</h2>

When you drink water after eating fish, the water can cause the proteins in the fish to solidify in your stomach.
