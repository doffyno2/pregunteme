<h2>Introduction</h2>

UHaul vans are a popular choice for many people who need to move items or transport passengers. UHaul vans are often used for short-distance trips, such as moving furniture or traveling to a family gathering. But when it comes to bigger trips, such as a long-distance move or a vacation, it can be difficult to figure out if a UHaul van is the right option.
