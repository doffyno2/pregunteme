<p>K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen or Chhogori, is the second highest mountain in the world, standing at 8,611 meters (28,251ft) above sea level. It is located on the China-Pakistan border in the Karakoram Range of the Himalayas. It is part of the same mountain range as Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.</p>

<p>K2 is an extremely challenging mountain to climb and has only been successfully summited by a few hundred people in history. It is considered to be one of the most dangerous and difficult mountains in the world and has seen more deaths per successful summit than any other mountain on Earth. In fact, it is estimated that there have been around 300 unsuccessful attempts to climb K2, resulting in at least 86 deaths.</p>

<p>The first successful ascent of K2 was made in 1954 by an Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio. The team included famed mountaineers Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli. The first woman to summit K2 was Wanda Rutkiewicz in 1986, who also became the first woman to summit an 8,000-meter peak. Other notable firsts include the first winter ascent of K2 in February 2021 by the Polish alpinist Andrzej Bargiel.</p>

<h2>What Makes K2 So Difficult To Climb?</h2>

<p>K2 is known as the "Savage Mountain" due to its steep slopes, icy conditions, and unpredictable weather. The mountain is characterized by steep faces and sharp ridges that make it difficult to ascend. The terrain is so difficult that a climber must use ropes and other equipment to make progress up the mountain. The weather can be an additional challenge, as whiteouts and high winds can make progress slow and dangerous. The high altitude of K2 also makes it difficult to acclimatize and can cause altitude sickness.</p>

<p>K2 is also a very remote mountain, and it can take days to reach the base camp. This means that climbers must be prepared for a long and arduous journey before they even reach the mountain. Once at the base camp, climbers must be aware of the risks posed by avalanches, crevasses, and falling rocks. Additionally, climbers must be prepared to face temperatures that can plunge to -60°C (-76°F).</p>
