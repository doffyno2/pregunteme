Humans have been using cannabis for centuries, but can other animals get high from it as well? We’ve heard of cats getting high, but what about our fishy friends? Can fish get high from cannabis? Let’s dive in and find out.

<h2>What Is Cannabis?</h2>

Cannabis is a plant that has been used for medicinal, spiritual and recreational purposes for thousands of years. It contains over 100 different compounds called cannabinoids, which interact with the human body’s endocannabinoid system. 

The two main cannabinoids are THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). THC is the psychoactive compound that produces the “high” associated with marijuana, while CBD is non-psychoactive and is often used for a variety of medicinal purposes.

<h2>Can Fish Get High From Cannabis?</h2>

The short answer is no. Fish are not mammals, so they process THC differently than mammals. While THC can still have an effect on fish, it won’t produce the same psychoactive effects that it produces in humans. 

Studies have shown that THC can have a sedative effect on fish, which can make them slower and more lethargic. But this isn’t the same thing as getting “high” from cannabis. 

<h2>What Happens If You Give Cannabis To Fish?</h2>

It’s not a good idea to give cannabis to fish. While it won’t get them “high,” it can still be toxic to them and may even cause death. 

In one study, researchers fed goldfish a solution of THC and CBD. The THC had a sedative effect on the fish, but the CBD caused them to become more active. 

<h2>Can Cannabis Help Fish?</h2>

While giving cannabis to fish isn’t a good idea, it may be possible to use cannabis-based medicines to treat certain conditions in fish. 

For example, a recent study found that CBD could be used to treat fin rot in fish. Fin rot is an infection that can cause the fish’s fins to rot away. The study found that CBD can help reduce inflammation and reduce the symptoms of fin rot. 

<h2>Can Other Animals Get High From Cannabis?</h2>

Yes, other animals can get high from cannabis. Cats, dogs, and even rats have been known to experience the psychoactive effects of cannabis when given the right amount. 

However, it’s important to note that animals process THC differently than humans. So, it’s important to be careful when giving cannabis to pets, as it can be toxic to them in large doses. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

So, can fish get high from weed? No, fish cannot get high from cannabis, as they process THC differently than mammals. That said, it’s not a good idea to give cannabis to fish, as it can be toxic to them. 

Cannabis may be beneficial for some animals, including fish, but it’s important to be careful when giving cannabis to pets. Always consult your vet before giving cannabis to animals.
