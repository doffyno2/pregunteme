<p>You may have heard that having a dog lick your dick is a bad idea, and for good reason. But is it really so bad? It depends on the circumstances, but it’s generally not recommended. Here, we’ll discuss why having a dog lick your dick isn’t a great idea and what you should do instead.</p>

<h2>Why Is Having a Dog Lick Your Dick Not Recommended?</h2>

<p>Having a dog lick your dick is not recommended for several reasons. The first is that it could spread germs and bacteria. Dogs have saliva that contains bacteria, and if this saliva comes in contact with your genitals, it could cause an infection. This is because your genitals are more sensitive than other parts of your body, and the bacteria can easily enter the body through cuts or abrasions on the skin.</p>

<p>Another reason why it’s not recommended is because it could lead to an embarrassing situation. While some people may find it funny, it can also be uncomfortable and embarrassing for both you and the dog. It’s also possible that the dog may not understand what you’re asking it to do, and this could lead to confusion or even aggression.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do Instead?</h2>

<p>If you want to show your dog affection, there are several better ways to do so. A simple pat or a treat are both good ways to show your dog that you care.
