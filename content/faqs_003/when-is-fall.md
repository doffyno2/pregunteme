<p>Fall, also known as autumn, is one of the four seasons that occur in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the transition period between summer and winter, during which the weather gradually cools off and the days become shorter. Fall is a beautiful time of year, with the leaves turning a variety of colors and the air becoming crisp and cool. Fall is a great time to enjoy outdoor activities and relax after a hectic summer.</p>

<p>Fall begins in September in the Northern Hemisphere and ends in December. The exact date of the first day of fall varies each year, but it generally occurs around the 22nd or 23rd of September. The first day of fall is known as the autumnal equinox, and marks the day when the sun is exactly over the equator. On this day, day and night are of equal length, and day length decreases as the fall season progresses.</p>

<h2>Signs of Fall</h2>

<p>There are several signs that indicate the arrival of fall. As the days become shorter, the temperature begins to drop. Leaves start to change color, and the air becomes crisper and cooler. People tend to wear heavier clothing as the weather cools off, and many festivals are held to celebrate the start of fall.</p>

<p>The changing of the leaves is perhaps the most iconic sign of fall. As the days become shorter, the trees start to produce less chlorophyll, resulting in their leaves changing color. Depending on where you live, the leaves will turn a variety of colors, ranging from golden yellows to deep reds and oranges. This is a beautiful sight, and many people enjoy taking walks in the woods during fall to admire the changing leaves.</p>

<h2>Activities to Enjoy During Fall</h2>

<p>Fall is a great time to enjoy outdoor activities. The cooler weather makes it ideal for hiking, biking, and camping. Many people also enjoy apple picking and visiting pumpkin patches to get into the fall spirit. Fall is also a great time for sports, such as football, soccer, and baseball.</p>

<p>The fall season is also a great time for festivals. Many cities and towns host fall festivals, with activities such as hayrides, corn mazes, and live music. These festivals are a great way to get into the spirit of the season and spend time with family and friends.</p>

<h2>What to Wear During Fall</h2>

<p>As the temperatures start to cool off during fall, it is important to dress appropriately for the weather. Layering is the key to staying warm and comfortable during fall. A light jacket or sweater should be worn over a t-shirt or tank top, and a scarf or hat can be added for extra warmth. Jeans and long pants are also essential during fall, as they provide extra protection from the cold.</p>

<p>Boots are also a great way to stay warm during fall. Boots come in a variety of styles and colors, so they can be easily matched with any outfit. They also provide extra protection from the elements, such as rain and snow.</p>
