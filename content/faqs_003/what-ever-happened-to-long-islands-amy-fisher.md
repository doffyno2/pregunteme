In the summer of 1992, a 17-year-old Long Island girl named Amy Fisher became the focus of a sensational media spectacle. Dubbed the “Long Island Lolita” by the press, Fisher’s story of a forbidden love affair with a married man older than her father and the attempted murder of his wife captivated the public and rocked Long Island society. But as the media attention has faded away, what has become of Amy Fisher?

<h2>The Affair</h2>

In May of 1991, Fisher met Joey Buttafuoco, a married man 22 years her senior, at his auto body shop in Massapequa.

Fisher would later tell the police that she and Buttafuoco had an intimate relationship for eight months before the incident.
