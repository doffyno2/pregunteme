We’ve all been there before: you’re walking around in your brand new pair of Air Force Ones and everyone can hear your shoes squeaking! While it may seem embarrassing at first, it’s actually a normal thing that happens with a lot of shoes, especially when you’re breaking them in. Here, we’ll discuss the reasons why your Air Force Ones are squeaking and what you can do to stop them from making so much noise. 

<h2>What Causes Air Force Ones to Squeak?</h2>

One of the most common causes of squeaking in Air Force Ones is due to a lack of friction between the sole and the upper. This is because the upper material is usually made from a smooth, leather or canvas material that doesn’t provide much grip. When you walk, the sole of your shoe can slide across the upper, creating a squeaking noise. 

Another cause could be due to the foam cushioning in the sole of the shoe. The foam material can also be quite slick and slippery, causing it to rub against the upper when you walk. This can create a squeaking sound as well. 

<h2>How to Stop Air Force Ones from Squeaking</h2>

Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to stop your Air Force Ones from squeaking. 

The first thing you can do is to add some friction to the sole of the shoe. This can be easily done by applying a small amount of adhesive such as shoe glue or a rubber-based adhesive. This will help to create more grip between the sole and the upper, reducing the amount of sliding and squeaking. 

You can also try applying some baby powder to the areas where the sole and upper meet. This will help to absorb any moisture that might be present, which can help to reduce the amount of friction as well. 

Finally, if the squeaking persists, you can try using a soft cloth to buff the sole of your shoe. This will help to create a smoother surface, reducing the amount of friction and noise.
