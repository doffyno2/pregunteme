At first glance, it may seem that the rules for Uno Attack are similar to the traditional Uno card game. But there are a few key differences that make Uno Attack much more exciting and challenging.

Uno Attack is a card game for two to ten players that is based on the popular game of Uno. The traditional Uno card game requires players to discard cards that match the current color or number.

The shooter randomly dispenses cards and can also be used to launch a “Fireworks” attack, which lets players discard multiple cards at once.
