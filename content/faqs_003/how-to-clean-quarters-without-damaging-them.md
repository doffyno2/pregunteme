Unfortunately, coins can accumulate dirt and grime over time, making them look dull and unappealing. Fortunately, there are several ways to clean quarters without damaging them.

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>Before you begin cleaning your quarters, you will need to gather the following supplies:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Cleaning Without Detergent</h2>

<p>The most basic method of cleaning quarters is to simply use a soft cloth. Take your cloth and dampen it with water. You don't want it too wet, as this could damage the coin. Gently rub the cloth over the surface of the quarter in a circular motion. This will help to remove any dirt and grime that has accumulated over time. Once you have finished, use a dry cloth to buff the coin. This will help to restore its shine.</p>

<h2>Cleaning With Detergent</h2>

<p>If the quarter is still dirty after using a soft cloth, you can try using a mild detergent. Add a few drops of detergent to a bowl of warm water and mix it together.

<h2>Using Vinegar and Baking Soda</h2>

<p>If the quarter is still dirty after using a soft cloth and soft toothbrush, you can try using a mixture of vinegar and baking soda. Take one part vinegar and two parts baking soda and mix it together to form a paste. Take a Q-tip and dip it into the paste. Gently rub the Q-tip over the surface of the quarter.
