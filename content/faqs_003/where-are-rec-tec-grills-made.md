In this article, we'll provide the answer to that question and explore the history of the company, their commitment to quality, and the types of grills they offer.

<h2>The History of Rec Tec Grills</h2>

Rec Tec Industries was founded in 2009 by brothers Brandon and Chris May. The company is based in Savannah, Georgia, and has become one of the leading producers of high-end grilling equipment.

Rec Tec takes pride in providing the highest quality grills to their customers. Each grill is made with heavy-duty materials and designed to last for years. The grills are powered by a 304 grade stainless steel burner, which provides even and consistent heat. The grates are made of porcelain-coated cast iron, which prevents flare-ups and helps the food cook evenly.
