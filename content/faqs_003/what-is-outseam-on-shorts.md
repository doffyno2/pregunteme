Shorts are a popular and versatile item of clothing for the warmer months. But when you start shopping for shorts, you may encounter a wide range of unfamiliar terms. One of these is the outseam, which describes the length of a pair of shorts from the top of the waistband to the bottom of the leg opening. In this article, we'll explain what an outseam is, how to measure it, and why it's important to consider when selecting shorts.

<h2>What is an Outseam?</h2>

An outseam is the length of a pair of shorts from the top of the waistband to the bottom of the leg opening. As its name suggests, it's measured on the outside of the garment. It's important to note that the outseam measurement doesn't include the rise, which is the distance between the top of the waistband and the crotch. 

<h2>How to Measure Outseam on Shorts</h2>

If you're shopping for shorts, you'll want to make sure you get the right fit. To do that, you'll need to take an outseam measurement. Here's how to do it:

<h3>Step 1: Lay the Shorts Flat</h3>

The first step is to lay the shorts on a flat surface. Make sure that the fabric is smooth and that there are no wrinkles or creases.

<h3>Step 2: Measure from Waistband to Leg Opening</h3>

Once the shorts are flat, use a measuring tape to measure the length from the top of the waistband to the bottom of the leg opening. This is the outseam measurement.

<h3>Step 3: Record the Measurement</h3>

Write down the outseam measurement and use it to compare with the sizing chart for the shorts you're interested in buying. This will help you determine the best size for your body type and shape.

<h2>Why is Outseam Important?</h2>

The outseam measurement is important for two reasons. First, it will help you get the right size for your body type and shape. Second, it will ensure that the shorts you buy will fit you properly.

When selecting shorts, it's important to consider not just the outseam measurement, but also the rise, inseam, and leg opening. These measurements will help you get the perfect fit for your body type and shape.
