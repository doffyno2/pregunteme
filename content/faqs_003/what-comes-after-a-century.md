Throughout the course of human history, eras have come and gone, often marked by significant events or changes. A century is a period of 100 years, and throughout each century, the world has changed in ways both great and small. But what comes after a century? How do we know when one century has ended and another has begun, and what can we expect from the future?

<h2>What is a Century?</h2>

A century is a period of 100 years, and it is often used to measure the passage of time. Centuries are often used to mark important events, such as the start of a new era or the introduction of a new technology. It is also common to use centuries to divide up long periods of time, such as the 20th century, which covers the years from 1900 to 1999.

<h2>When Does a Century Begin and End?</h2>

A century begins with the first year of the century and ends with the hundredth year. For example, the 21st century began on January 1, 2001 and ends on December 31, 2100. In some cases, a century will be divided into two halves, such as the 19th century, which is often divided into the early 19th century (1800-1849) and the late 19th century (1850-1899).

<h2>What Events Mark the Start and End of a Century?</h2>

The start and end of a century can be marked by a variety of events. The start of a new century is often marked by a celebration, such as the start of the millennium in 2000. The end of a century can be marked by a significant event, such as the end of World War II in 1945. In some cases, the start and end of a century may go unnoticed, as certain events may not be considered significant enough to mark the end of one century and the start of another.

<h2>What Can We Expect From the Future?</h2>

Since centuries are periods of 100 years, it is difficult to predict what the world will look like at the end of the 21st century. However, some trends suggest that the world will continue to become more interconnected and that technology will continue to advance. The world may become more globalized, with different countries becoming more intertwined and cultures becoming more similar. Additionally, technology is likely to continue to develop, making the world more efficient and interconnected.
