<p>When it comes to hot dogs, there are two main types: uncured and cured. While they may look the same on the surface, there are some key differences between the two. In this article, we’ll take a look at what sets uncured and cured hot dogs apart, their respective health benefits and drawbacks, and how to tell them apart. </p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between Uncured and Cured Hot Dogs?</h2>

<p>The primary difference between uncured and cured hot dogs is the way in which they are prepared and cooked. Uncured hot dogs are made from raw, unprocessed meat. This means that the meat is not preserved with salt or chemicals, and it is cooked and eaten fresh. Cured hot dogs, on the other hand, are made from processed meat that has been preserved using salt and/or chemicals. These hot dogs are then cooked and eaten. </p>

<p>Uncured hot dogs are usually made with natural ingredients such as pork, beef, chicken, turkey, and sometimes even tofu. They’re usually flavored with spices such as onion, garlic, and paprika. Cured hot dogs, on the other hand, are typically made with processed meat such as beef and pork, and are often flavored with nitrates, nitrites, and other chemicals. </p>
