<h2>Introduction</h2>
An axe is a tool used for cutting, splitting, and chopping wood, and it is an essential tool for anyone who works with wood. It is also a valuable tool for anyone who enjoys outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and bushcraft. However, like any tool, an axe will eventually become dull and require restoration. If you are looking to restore your axe to its former glory, then the following guide will show you how to restore an axe. 

<h2>Safety First</h2>
Before you begin, it is important to take the necessary safety precautions. Wearing safety goggles and gloves is recommended, as is working in a well-ventilated area. Additionally, you should make sure that your axe is properly secured before you start to sharpen it. 

<h2>Cleaning the Axe</h2>
The first step in restoring your axe is to clean it. Begin by wiping away any dirt or debris from the blade and handle with a cloth. You can also use a small brush to remove any tough dirt or rust from the blade. Once the axe is cleaned, it is important to dry it thoroughly. 

<h2>Sharpening the Blade</h2>
Once the axe is cleaned, it is time to sharpen the blade. You will need to use a sharpening stone, which can be purchased at any hardware store. Start by laying the stone flat on a sturdy surface. Place the axe blade against the stone, making sure the cutting edge is facing away from you. Apply light pressure and move the blade in a circular motion, continuing until the blade is sharp. Once you have finished sharpening the blade, use a clean cloth to wipe away any metal filings. 

<h2>Restoring the Handle</h2>
The next step is to restore the handle of the axe. Start by removing the old handle and inspecting it for damage. If the handle is cracked or broken, it should be replaced. If the handle is in good condition, then use a cloth to wipe away any dirt or debris. You can also use a small brush to remove tough dirt or grime. Once the handle is clean, you can apply a sealant to protect it from moisture. 

<h2>Applying a Protective Finish</h2>
Once the handle is restored, it is time to apply a protective finish. This will help protect the axe from rust and corrosion. Start by wiping the blade and handle with a clean cloth to remove any dust or debris. You can then apply a coat of wax or oil to the blade and handle. This will help protect the axe from moisture and make it easier to clean in the future. 

<h2>Storing the Axe</h2>
Once you have restored your axe, it is important to store it properly. Store the axe in a dry location and make sure it is out of reach of children. You should also avoid storing the axe in direct sunlight, as this can cause the blade to become dull over time.
