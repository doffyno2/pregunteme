<p>Lactic acid build-up in the body is a common symptom of strenuous physical activity, such as running or weight lifting. While lactic acid is not necessarily harmful in and of itself, it can lead to pain and discomfort, making it difficult to continue with your exercise. For this reason, many people are looking for supplements that can help reduce lactic acid buildup in the body.</p>

<p>There are a number of different supplements available that are believed to help reduce lactic acid buildup. These supplements may work by providing the body with essential nutrients, such as amino acids, that help to reduce the amount of lactic acid produced. They may also help to increase the body’s ability to process lactic acid, allowing for better recovery and less discomfort.</p>

<h2>What is Lactic Acid?</h2>

<p>Lactic acid is produced in the body as a byproduct of using energy. When the body is using energy, it produces lactic acid as a waste product. Lactic acid is naturally produced in the body, but during periods of intense physical activity, such as weight lifting or running, the body produces more lactic acid than it can process. This causes a buildup of lactic acid in the body, resulting in pain and discomfort.</p>
