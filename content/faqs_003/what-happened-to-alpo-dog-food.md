<p>Alpo is a brand of dog food that has been around since the 1930s, when it was created by Robert F. Hunsicker. The brand has since become one of the most well-known dog food brands in the world, and is a favorite among pet owners everywhere. Despite its popularity, however, Alpo has recently been in the news for not-so-positive reasons, with news reports from 2016 claiming that the brand had been linked to a number of health issues in dogs.</p>

<p>The first controversy surrounding Alpo dog food came in 2016, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it was investigating a number of pet food brands, including Alpo. The FDA had received complaints from pet owners that their dogs had become ill after eating Alpo products, and the agency was looking into the matter to see if there was any truth to the allegations. The FDA ultimately determined that there was not enough evidence to link the illnesses to the brand, but the news still caused a stir among pet owners.</p>

<p>Shortly after the FDA investigation, reports began to surface that Alpo had been using ingredients that were not approved by the American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). This organization sets the standards for pet food ingredients, and any products that do not meet their standards may not be considered safe for consumption. Alpo was found to be using a number of ingredients that were not approved by AAFCO, including some that were found to be potentially toxic to dogs. The brand was quickly forced to remove these ingredients from their products.</p>

<p>The controversy didn't end there, however. In 2018, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Alpo, claiming that the company had made false and misleading statements about the quality of their products. The lawsuit alleged that the company had been using inferior ingredients and marketing their products as being of higher quality than they actually were. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, but the damage had already been done.</p>

<p>Today, Alpo is still a popular brand of dog food, but the controversies of the past have left many pet owners wary. It is important to do your own research and make sure that the ingredients in the food you are feeding your pet are safe and approved by the AAFCO. Alpo has made changes to their products since the controversy, and they are now in compliance with AAFCO standards. However, it is still important to be aware of the issues that have been raised in the past.</p>
