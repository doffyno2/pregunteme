<p>Fallout 76 is the newest addition to the Fallout family, and it brings a whole new set of rules and challenges. One of these rules is the weight limit, or encumbrance, of the player character. In Fallout 76, the weight limit is 5,000 pounds, and if that limit is exceeded, the character is considered over encumbered. But what does this mean for fast travel? Can you fast travel while over encumbered in Fallout 76?</p>

<p>The answer is, unfortunately, no. If your character is over encumbered, you will not be able to fast travel in Fallout 76. This is because the weight limit is a hard limit, and cannot be exceeded, even temporarily. If your character is over encumbered, you will be unable to fast travel until you have lightened your load.</p>

<p>So, what can you do if you are over encumbered? The first step is to lighten your load. This can be done by dropping items, selling them, or storing them in a stash box. Once your load has been lightened and you are no longer over encumbered, you will be able to fast travel. Additionally, if you find yourself over encumbered and unable to fast travel, you can try to find a nearby vendor or stash box to store your excess items.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that fast travel is not the only way to move around in Fallout 76. If you are over encumbered and unable to fast travel, you can always walk or use a C.A.M.P. to move around. This may be slower, but it is still a viable way to get around in the game. Additionally, you can always try to find a teammate or a fellow player to help you out with your load.</p>
