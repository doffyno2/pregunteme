Contrary to popular belief, deserts are not always hot. In fact, some of the coldest temperatures ever recorded on Earth occurred in the Antarctic desert. But if you’re looking for the hottest desert on the planet, then you’ll have to look elsewhere. The world’s hottest desert is the Sahara desert, located in North Africa.

<h2>Location of the Sahara Desert</h2>

The Sahara desert is the largest hot desert in the world. It covers a vast area of more than 3.5 million square miles, which is roughly the size of the United States and Mexico combined. The desert is located primarily in Northern Africa and extends from the Red Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Sahel in the south.

<h2>Climate of the Sahara Desert</h2>

The Sahara desert has a hot, arid climate. The temperatures in the desert can exceed 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) during the day and can drop to below freezing at night. The average annual rainfall in the Sahara desert is less than 4 inches, which is why it is considered a desert. The desert receives most of its rain during the summer months, with an average of 1 inch per month during this time.

<h2>Vegetation in the Sahara Desert</h2>

Due to its arid climate, there is very little vegetation in the Sahara desert. The few plants that do grow there have adapted to survive in the desert’s harsh conditions, such as extreme heat and lack of water. Some of the most common plants in the Sahara desert are acacias, palms, thorn bushes, and grasses.

<h2>Animals in the Sahara Desert</h2>

Despite its harsh environment, the Sahara desert is home to a variety of animals, including birds, reptiles, and mammals. Some of the most common animals in the Sahara desert include desert foxes, gazelles, hyenas, jackals, lizards, and snakes.
