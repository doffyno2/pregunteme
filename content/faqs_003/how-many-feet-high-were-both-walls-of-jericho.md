<p>The walls of Jericho were a set of impressive fortifications that surrounded the ancient city of Jericho in the Middle East. Built thousands of years ago, the walls provided protection and security for the people living within the city, as well as making it difficult for attackers to breach. The walls were so impressive that they have become a part of both religious and cultural lore. But just how high were the walls of Jericho?</p>

<h2>What is the History of the Walls of Jericho?</h2>

<p>The walls of Jericho were first built by the Canaanites, an ancient Semitic people who inhabited the Levant region of the Middle East. The city was located on a hilltop and was surrounded by a wall made of stone and mud-brick. The wall was designed to keep out invaders and protect the city against attack. The Canaanites believed that the wall would make it impossible for any enemy to breach the city, and they believed that it was a sign that the gods favored them.</p>

<p>The walls of Jericho are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, where they are described as being “thirty feet high and ten cubits thick.” This would make the walls approximately 45 feet high, or about the height of a four-story building. The walls were so impressive that they have become a part of both religious and cultural lore. In the Hebrew Bible, the walls are described as being so strong that they could not be breached, even by the forces of Joshua, who is said to have caused the city to collapse by blowing his trumpet.</p>

<p>It is also possible that the walls were even higher than 45 feet. The walls could have been constructed with multiple levels, as was common in ancient cities.
