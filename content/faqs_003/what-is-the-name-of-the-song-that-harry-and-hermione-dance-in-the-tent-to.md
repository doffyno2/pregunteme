<p>“Once there were three brothers,<br>
Who each had a magical gift,<br>
The first had an Elder Wand,<br>
The second had a Resurrection Stone,<br>
And the third had a Cloak of Invisibility.<br>
The three brothers met Death,<br>
Who gave them each a task.<br>
The first was given the task of mastering the Elder Wand,<br>
The second was given the task of resurrecting the dead,<br>
And the third was given the task of finding what could not be seen.<br>
The three brothers accepted the tasks,<br>
And they each set out on their journeys.<br>
The first brother mastered the Elder Wand,<br>
The second brother resurrected the dead,<br>
And the third brother found what could not be seen.<br>
But their journeys were not without danger,<br>
And each brother faced the ultimate evil.<br>
The first brother was defeated by a powerful wizard,<br>
The second brother was betrayed by a friend,<br>
And the third brother was finally defeated by Death himself.<br>
But in the end, each brother was successful,<br>
And they were reunited in death.<br>
They each had faced their fears,<br>
And they had each found what they were looking for.<br>
They had found the truth of their lives,<br>
And they had found the courage to be true to themselves.<br>
And so, the Tale of Three Brothers was born.”</p>
