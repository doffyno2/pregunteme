Manhattan, the most densely populated of New York City's five boroughs, is home to some of the world's most iconic landmarks and sights. But how many miles wide is the island?

The answer to this question is not as straightforward as it may seem. The answer depends on a few factors, including how you define the boundaries of the island and which measurements you use. In this article, we'll explore the different ways to measure the size of Manhattan and the estimated results. 

<h2>Defining the Boundaries of Manhattan</h2>

The first step to answering the question of how many miles wide is Manhattan is to define the boundaries of the island. Generally, Manhattan is considered to include the area of land and water between the Hudson and East Rivers, as well as the Harlem River. The area also includes the smaller islands of Randall's and Wards Islands and the Marble Hill neighborhood, which is located in the northernmost part of Manhattan. 

<h2>Measuring the Size of Manhattan</h2>

Once the boundaries of Manhattan have been defined, the next step is to measure its size. The most common way to measure the size of Manhattan is by calculating the area of the island. The total area of Manhattan is approximately 22.96 square miles. 

Another way to measure the size of Manhattan is by calculating the circumference of the island. To calculate the circumference of Manhattan, one must first measure the length and width of the island. The length of Manhattan is approximately 13.4 miles, and the width of the island is approximately 2.3 miles. Multiplying these two numbers together yields the circumference of Manhattan, which is approximately 30.82 miles. 

<h2>Estimating the Population of Manhattan</h2>

In addition to measuring the size of Manhattan, it is also possible to estimate the population of the island. According to the latest estimates, there are approximately 1,630,000 people living in Manhattan. This means that the population density of Manhattan is approximately 71,000 people per square mile.
