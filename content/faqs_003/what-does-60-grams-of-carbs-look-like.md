Carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet, and knowing how much to consume can be challenging. While there is no single answer to this question, it is helpful to know what 60 grams of carbohydrates looks like in different foods. This article will provide you with an overview of what 60 grams of carbs looks like, as well as information about the types of carbohydrates, their sources, and how they fit into a healthy eating plan. 

<h2>What Are Carbohydrates?</h2>

Carbohydrates are a type of macronutrient found in food that provide the body with energy. They are made up of sugar molecules, and can be found in a variety of foods, including grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and dairy products. The body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which is then used for energy. 

<h2>Types of Carbohydrates</h2>

There are three main types of carbohydrates: simple carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, and fiber. Simple carbohydrates are made up of one or two sugar molecules and are found in foods like white bread, candy, and soda. These types of carbohydrates are quickly broken down and absorbed by the body, providing an instant source of energy. Complex carbohydrates are made up of multiple sugar molecules, and are found in foods like potatoes, whole grains, and legumes. These types of carbohydrates take longer to break down and provide a more sustained source of energy. Fiber is not digested by the body, but is important for digestion and elimination. 

<h2>Sources of Carbohydrates</h2>

Carbohydrates can be found in a variety of foods. Common sources include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, milk, yogurt, and nuts.
