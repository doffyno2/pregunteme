<p>Playing the Sims 4 with a pet can be a great way to add some extra fun to your game. As your pet ages, it can become more powerful and unlock new interactions and abilities.

<p>Unlike other Sims, dogs do not age up automatically in Sims 4. Instead, you must purchase an Age Up Potion from the rewards store. The Age Up Potion is found under the “pet rewards” tab and costs 500 Simoleons. Once you purchase the potion, simply select it from your inventory and click on your pet. The Age Up Potion will turn your pet into an adult. </p>

<h2>What Happens When a Dog Ages Up</h2>

<h2>Tips for Aging Up a Dog</h2>

<p>When you're ready to age up your dog, there are a few things you can do to make sure the process goes as smoothly as possible.
