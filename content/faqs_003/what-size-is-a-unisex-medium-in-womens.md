<p>Clothing sizes can be a source of frustration for many shoppers, especially when it comes to unisex items. Unisex items are designed to fit both men and women, but the sizing is often different than what you would find in a women’s clothing store. In this article, we will explore what size is a unisex medium in womens.</p>

<h2>Unisex Sizing for Clothing</h2>

<p>Unisex sizes are often referred to as ‘one size fits all’. This means that the garment is designed to fit a larger range of body types than a standard women’s or men’s size. Unisex sizes are typically cut a little larger than their gender-specific counterparts. As a result, a unisex medium is likely to be slightly larger than a women’s medium.</p>

<h2>How to Convert Unisex Sizes to Women’s Sizes</h2>

<p>Converting unisex sizes to women’s sizes is not an exact science. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you determine the approximate women’s size for a unisex garment. Generally, it is best to size down one size for women’s clothing; for example, a unisex medium would be approximately the same size as a women’s small.</p>

<p>It is important to note that not all brands use the same sizing guidelines for unisex clothing. For this reason, it is always best to check the manufacturer’s size chart before making a purchase. This will help ensure that you select the correct size for your body type.</p>

<h2>Tips for Buying Unisex Clothing</h2>

<p>When shopping for unisex clothing, it is important to keep in mind that the fit may be different than what you would expect from a gender-specific garment. Unisex clothing is designed to fit a variety of body types, so it may be looser or more relaxed than what you are used to. It is also important to be aware of any brand-specific sizing recommendations. Additionally, it is always a good idea to try on the garment before making a purchase to ensure that it fits properly.</p>
