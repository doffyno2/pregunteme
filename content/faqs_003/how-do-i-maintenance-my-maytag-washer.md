<p>Maintaining a Maytag washer is important for ensuring it performs efficiently and lasts for years to come. Proper maintenance also helps to prevent any costly repairs. Whether you have just purchased a Maytag washer or have owned one for years, it is important to understand how to properly maintain your Maytag washer.</p>

<h2>General Maintenance</h2>

<p>As with any appliance, general maintenance is important for ensuring that your Maytag washer continues to work properly. Cleaning the outside of the washer regularly is essential. This includes wiping off any dust or dirt that may have accumulated. Also check for any signs of rust or damage that may need to be addressed.</p>

<p>In addition to cleaning the outside of the washer, it is also important to periodically check the inside of the washer. This includes checking the seals and gaskets for any signs of wear. Additionally, check the drain hose, as well as the inlet and outlet valves. If any of these components appear to be worn or damaged, they should be replaced.</p>

<p>Once a month, it is also important to check the detergent dispenser for any signs of build up. This build up can cause the detergent to not be dispensed properly, which can lead to poor washing results. Additionally, it is important to periodically check the drain pump for any signs of blockage. If any blockage is found, it should be removed to ensure proper draining of the washer.</p>

<h2>Proper Use of Detergent and Softeners</h2>

<p>Using the proper amount of detergent and softeners is essential for ensuring that your Maytag washer continues to work properly and efficiently. Overloading the washer with detergent can cause the washer to become unbalanced and cause the seals to wear prematurely. Additionally, overloading with detergent can also cause the washer to not clean properly. When adding detergent, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>In addition to using the proper amount of detergent, it is also important to use the proper type of detergent. Generally, liquid detergents are preferred over powder detergents, as they are less likely to cause build-up in the washer. Additionally, it is important to use only high-efficiency (HE) detergents in high-efficiency (HE) washers.</p>

<p>Softeners are also important for ensuring that your Maytag washer continues to work properly. When using softeners, it is important to use the proper amount. Too much softener can cause the seals to wear prematurely, which can lead to leaks. Additionally, softeners can also cause build-up in the washer, which can lead to poor washing results.</p>

<h2>Proper Loading of the Washer</h2>

<p>Properly loading the washer is essential for ensuring that your Maytag washer continues to work properly and efficiently. Overloading the washer can cause the washer to become unbalanced, which can lead to premature wear on the seals and gaskets. Additionally, overloading can also cause the washer to not clean properly.</p>

<p>When loading the washer, it is important to make sure that the load is evenly distributed. Additionally, it is important to not fill the washer above the recommended capacity. Finally, it is important to make sure that any items that are to be washed are suitable for the washer. Not all items are suitable for washing in a Maytag washer, and it is important to read the manufacturer’s instructions before washing any items.</p>

<h2>Proper Care of the Washer</h2>

<p>Proper care of the washer is essential for ensuring that it continues to work properly and efficiently. If the washer is left idle for an extended period of time, it is important to periodically check the seals and gaskets for any signs of wear.
