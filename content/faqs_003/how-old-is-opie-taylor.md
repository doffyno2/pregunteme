Opie Taylor is a fictional character from the American television sitcom The Andy Griffith Show, which originally aired from 1960 to 1968 on CBS. Opie Taylor, played by child actor Ron Howard, is the son of widower and small-town sheriff Andy Taylor. Opie Taylor is one of the most beloved characters in television history, and his age has been the subject of much debate over the years. Here, we will take a look at how old Opie Taylor was during the course of the show and explore the various ways that his age was portrayed.

<h2>Opie Taylor's Age During the Show</h2>

During the first two seasons of The Andy Griffith Show, Opie Taylor was portrayed as a young boy of about six or seven years old. This age is consistent with the age of Ron Howard at the time, who was born in 1954. During the third season of the show, Opie Taylor is shown to be a bit older, as he is seen in school and playing sports with other children his age. This would indicate that he is about eight or nine years old during the third season.

<h2>How Old is Opie Taylor Now?</h2>

Ron Howard, the actor who played Opie Taylor, is now 66 years old. This means that, if Opie Taylor had aged at the same rate as Ron Howard, he would now be in his mid-fifties. However, since the show ended in 1968 and Ron Howard is now 66 years old, it is likely that Opie Taylor has aged a bit slower than Ron Howard has in real life.

<h2>How Old Was Opie Taylor Supposed to Be?</h2>

In the original script for the show, Opie Taylor was supposed to be 10 years old. This age remained consistent throughout the show's first two seasons, but by the third season, Ron Howard had aged to the point where he was no longer believable as a 10-year-old boy. As a result, the writers decided to make Opie Taylor a bit older, which is why he was seen in school during the third season.

<h2>What Did Opie Taylor Do After the Show?</h2>

After The Andy Griffith Show ended in 1968, Ron Howard went on to become a successful director and actor, starring in such films as Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. Opie Taylor, meanwhile, remained in Mayberry and was seen in occasional episodes of the spinoff series Mayberry R.F.D. and the reunion movie Return to Mayberry.
