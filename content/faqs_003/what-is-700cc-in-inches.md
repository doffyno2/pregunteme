<p>700cc is a unit of measurement used to measure the volume or capacity of an item. The cc stands for cubic centimeters, which is the same as milliliters. A cubic centimeter is a unit of volume that is equal to the volume of a cube with edges that are one centimeter in length. To put it simply, it is a measure of how much space something takes up.</p>

<p>Inches, on the other hand, are a unit of length. They are abbreviated as “in”, and are used to measure the length of an object or the distance between two points. One inch is equivalent to 2.54 centimeters, and is represented by the symbol “in”.</p>

<p>To convert 700cc to inches, we must first convert cc to liters. To do this, we divide 700cc by 1000, which gives us 0.7 liters. We then multiply 0.7 liters by 61.02 in³/liter, which gives us 42.714 in³. This means that 700cc is equal to 42.714 inches cubed.</p>
