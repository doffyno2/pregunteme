#What Size is 60 cm? 


In today’s world, sizes can vary greatly between different countries, manufacturers, and even within the same product line. It’s not uncommon to find two items that are labeled with the same measurement, yet are still different sizes. This can be especially confusing when trying to determine the size of something if you don’t have access to a ruler or measuring tape, or if you’re buying something sight unseen. Understanding the size of 60 cm can help you make better decisions when shopping, or help you understand the size of something you already own.
