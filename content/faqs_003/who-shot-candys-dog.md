<p>Candy's dog was a four-year-old black Labrador Retriever named Spot. He was a beloved pet in the small town of Springville, where he was often seen accompanying Candy on her walks around the neighborhood. One evening, Spot was found dead in Candy's yard, shot with a single bullet wound to the head. The town was in shock and everyone wanted to know who had done such a horrible thing.</p>

<p>The police immediately began their investigation, with the first suspect being an ex-boyfriend of Candy's. He had been seen around town recently, and his alibi didn't hold up when questioned. However, he was eventually cleared as a suspect when it was discovered that he had been at work at the time of the shooting. The police continued to investigate, but eventually the case went cold.</p>

<p>It wasn't until two years later that the mystery was solved. A local hunter had seen a man he recognized as a local drifter on the day of the shooting. He had been hunting in the area and noticed the man had a rifle in his possession. He reported this to the police, who were able to trace the rifle back to the drifter. Upon questioning, the drifter admitted to shooting Spot, though he claimed he had been aiming at a rabbit and had not realized what he had done. He was arrested and charged with animal cruelty.</p>

<p>The town was relieved that justice had finally been served, but the incident left a lasting impact on Candy and the other pet owners in Springville. They became more vigilant about their pets' safety and made sure to keep them indoors when possible. It also sparked a conversation about gun control in the town, as many now questioned why someone with a gun was allowed to roam around their neighborhood freely.</p>

The drifter who was arrested for the crime claimed that he had been aiming at a rabbit, but why he would do so in such a populated area is unknown. Some speculate that he may have been trying to scare Candy, while others believe he was trying to send a message to the other pet owners in the town. Whatever the motive, it was a senseless and tragic act of violence.</p>
