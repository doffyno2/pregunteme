<p>Pulled pork is one of the most popular and delicious dishes in the United States. It is a favored barbecue dish because it is easy to prepare, full of flavor and can be served in a variety of ways. But, once you’ve cooked your pulled pork, how do you store it and how long will it last in the fridge?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on a few factors. First, the type of pulled pork you’re dealing with. Second, the way it has been cooked and stored. And lastly, the conditions of your refrigerator. Let’s take a look at each of these factors in more detail.</p>

<h2>Type of Pulled Pork</h2>

<p>The type of pulled pork you are dealing with will have a big impact on how long it will last in the fridge. Typically, pulled pork is made from pork shoulder or pork butt, both of which are tough cuts of meat. The tougher the cut of meat, the longer it can last in the fridge. For instance, a pork shoulder that has been cooked correctly can last up to 4 days in the fridge. On the other hand, a pork butt that has been cooked correctly can last up to 5 days in the fridge.</p>

<h2>Cooking and Storage Methods</h2>

<p>The way you have cooked and stored your pulled pork will also affect how long it will last in the fridge. If you have cooked your pulled pork using low and slow cooking methods, such as smoking, then it can last up to 5 days in the fridge. If you have cooked your pulled pork using a pressure cooker or any other high-temperature cooking methods, then it can last up to 3 days in the fridge.</p>

<p>When it comes to storage, it is best to store your pulled pork in airtight containers or in the refrigerator. This will help to keep the pulled pork fresh and will help it last longer. Additionally, it is important to store your pulled pork in the coldest part of the refrigerator. This will help to keep the pulled pork cold and will help to prevent it from spoiling.</p>

<h2>Conditions of Your Refrigerator</h2>

<p>The conditions of your refrigerator will also affect how long your pulled pork will last in the fridge. If your refrigerator is running at a higher than normal temperature, then your pulled pork will not last as long as it would if it were stored in a cooler temperature. Additionally, if your refrigerator is not clean or is not maintained properly, then this can also affect how long your pulled pork will last.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, how long your pulled pork will last in the fridge depends on several factors, including the type of pulled pork, the way it has been cooked and stored, and the conditions of your refrigerator. Generally speaking, pulled pork can last up to 4 or 5 days in the fridge if it has been cooked correctly and stored properly.
