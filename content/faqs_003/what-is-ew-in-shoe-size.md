Shoe sizing can be a tricky process, especially when it comes to trying to figure out what shoe size to buy. Shopping for shoes online, for example, can be especially difficult, since you can’t try them on or measure your feet beforehand. So, what is new in shoe sizes?

<h2>Measuring Your Feet</h2>

The first step in finding the right shoe size is measuring your feet. This can be done in a few different ways. The simplest and most accurate way is to have your feet measured professionally at a shoe store. This will ensure that your shoes are the proper size. However, if you’re shopping online, this may not be an option.

In this case, you can measure your feet at home using a ruler or measuring tape. Begin by standing on a flat surface and tracing the outline of your foot onto a piece of paper. Then, measure the length and width of your foot in inches and compare the measurements to a shoe size chart.

<h2>International Shoe Sizes</h2>

In addition to standard US/UK shoe sizes, there are also many different international shoe sizes. For example, many European countries use the European Shoe Size (EU) system, which is based on the length of the foot in centimeters. There is also the Mondopoint system, which is mainly used in Asia and is based on the length of the foot in millimeters.

When shopping for shoes online, it’s important to make sure that you’re looking at the correct size chart. Otherwise, you may end up ordering the wrong size.

<h2>Width Sizing</h2>

In addition to length sizing, many shoe stores also offer width sizing. This is especially important for people with narrow or wide feet. Many stores offer widths ranging from extra narrow to extra wide, so it’s important to make sure that you order the correct width. If you’re unsure of your width size, you can measure your feet using a ruler or measuring tape.

<h2>Custom Shoes</h2>

For those who have difficulty finding the perfect size, there are also many companies that offer custom-made shoes. These companies often create shoes to the exact measurements of your feet. This is especially helpful for those with feet of unusual sizes.

<h2>Size Conversion Charts</h2>

If you’re shopping for shoes online and need to convert sizes, there are many size conversion charts available. These charts are helpful when comparing sizes between different countries or systems. For example, if you’re shopping for shoes in the UK and need to convert to US sizes, a size conversion chart can be very helpful.

<h2>Fitting Shoes</h2>

Once you’ve found the right size, it’s important to make sure that the shoes fit properly. Shoes that are too tight can cause blisters, while shoes that are too loose can cause slipping and tripping. Be sure to try the shoes on before buying them and make sure that they fit properly.
