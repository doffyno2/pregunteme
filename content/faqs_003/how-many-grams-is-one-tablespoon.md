<p>One of the most common cooking and baking questions is “how many grams is one tablespoon?” It is an important question to understand when measuring ingredients for recipes, as different ingredients have different weights.</p>

<p>A tablespoon, abbreviated as “tbsp”, is a unit of measurement for volume in the Imperial and United States customary systems of measurement. A tablespoon is equal to 1/2 fluid ounce, which is about 14.8 milliliters. It is also equal to three teaspoons, or 1/16 of a cup.</p>

<p>The weight of a tablespoon of a particular ingredient will depend on the density of that ingredient. The density of an ingredient is how much mass is in a certain volume. For example, a tablespoon of water will weigh less than a tablespoon of sugar because water is less dense than sugar.</p>
