<h2>Step 1: Clean the Velcro</h2>

<p>The first step to making Velcro sticky again is to clean the Velcro. Dirt, dust and other debris can accumulate on the sticky surface and reduce its adhesive properties.

<h2>Step 3: Apply Adhesive</h2>

<p>If the above steps don’t work, then you may need to apply an adhesive to the Velcro.
