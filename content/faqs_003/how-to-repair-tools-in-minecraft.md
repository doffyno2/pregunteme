<p>Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game that has been around since 2009. The game is set in a 3D world, and players can create and explore their own worlds. One of the most important aspects of the game is tools. Tools are used for crafting, mining, and combat. It's important to keep your tools in top condition, as they can become damaged over time. In this article, we'll discuss how to repair tools in Minecraft.</p>

<h2>What Tools Can be Repaired?</h2>

<p>Most tools in Minecraft can be repaired, including pickaxes, axes, swords, and shovels. Some tools, such as hoes and fishing rods, cannot be repaired. It's important to note that some tools, such as enchanted tools, cannot be repaired.</p>

<h2>How to Repair Tools</h2>

<p>Repairing tools in Minecraft is a simple process. First, you'll need a crafting table. You can craft a crafting table by placing four wooden planks in a square on the crafting grid. Once you have a crafting table, place the damaged tool in the center of the crafting grid. Place the repair material in the other slots. The repair material must match the material of the tool to be repaired. For example, an iron pickaxe must be repaired with iron ingots. The repair material will be consumed in the process, so make sure you have enough.</p>

<h2>What Materials Can be Used to Repair Tools?</h2>

<p>The materials used to repair tools depend on the type of tool being repaired. For example, an iron pickaxe must be repaired with iron ingots, while a stone pickaxe must be repaired with cobblestone. You can also use nuggets, which are smaller versions of the repair material. For example, you can use gold nuggets to repair a gold pickaxe.</p>

<h2>Repairing Enchanted Tools</h2>

<p>Enchanted tools cannot be repaired in the traditional way. Instead, you'll need to use an anvil. An anvil can be crafted by placing three iron blocks and four iron ingots in the crafting grid. Once you have an anvil, place the damaged enchanted tool in the top slot and the repair material in the bottom slot. As before, the repair material must match the material of the tool to be repaired.</p>

<h2>Using Mending</h2>

<p>Mending is an enchantment that can be applied to tools. When a tool with the mending enchantment is used, it will slowly repair itself over time. This is a great way to keep your tools in top condition without having to constantly repair them. Mending can be applied to tools by using an enchantment table.</p>
