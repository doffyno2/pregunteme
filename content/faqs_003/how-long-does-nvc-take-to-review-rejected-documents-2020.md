How Long Does NVC Take to Review Rejected Documents in 2020?



The National Visa Center (NVC) is an office within the U.S. Department of State that provides services to foreign nationals applying for an immigrant visa to enter the United States. NVC is responsible for the processing of immigrant visa petitions, the collection and review of visa applications and documents, and the scheduling of visa interviews. 

The length of time it takes for NVC to review a rejected document depends on a few factors. In some cases, the review process can be relatively quick; in others, it can take several months. In this article, we'll discuss how long NVC takes to review rejected documents in 2020, and what you can do to speed up the process.

<h2>What Is the NVC Review Process?</h2>

When a foreign national applies for an immigrant visa, the NVC reviews the applicant's documents to determine if they meet the criteria for approval. This includes verifying the applicant's identity, employment history, education, and any other pertinent information. 

Once the documents have been reviewed, the NVC may either approve or reject the application. If it is rejected, the applicant will receive an email or a letter explaining why the application was denied. The applicant then has a certain amount of time to provide additional documentation to support their claim.

The length of time it takes for NVC to review rejected documents can vary depending on a few factors. Generally, the review process can take anywhere from a few days to several months. In some cases, the review process may take longer due to an excessive backlog of applications. 

In addition, the length of time it takes to review a rejected document can also depend on the type of document being reviewed. Some documents, such as birth certificates, can be reviewed relatively quickly, while others, such as medical records, may take longer.
