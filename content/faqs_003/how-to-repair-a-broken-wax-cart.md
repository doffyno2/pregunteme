<p>If you're a vaper, then chances are you've experienced the unfortunate situation of having a broken wax cart. Whether you've accidentally overfilled it, left it in the sun too long, or just had too much wax in it, it can be a huge hassle to get it back up and running again. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to repair a broken wax cart and get it back to working condition.</p>

<h2>Step One: Clean the Cartridge</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a broken wax cart is to clean it. This should be done with a soft cloth and warm, soapy water. Be sure to rinse the cartridge off thoroughly with warm water to remove any soap residue. Once the cartridge is clean, you can move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Replace the Wick</h2>

<p>The next step in repairing a broken wax cart is to replace the wick. This is the part of the cartridge that absorbs the wax and allows it to be vaporized. To replace the wick, simply unscrew the old wick and replace it with a new one. Make sure to use a wick that is compatible with your wax cart.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Reapply the Wax</h2>

<p>Once you have replaced the wick, it's time to reapply the wax. This should be done with a cotton swab and a small amount of wax. Be sure to apply the wax evenly and to make sure that no excess wax is left behind. You can also use a paper towel or a small brush to help spread the wax evenly.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Reassemble the Cartridge</h2>

<p>Once the wax has been reapplied, it's time to reassemble the cartridge. This should be done carefully, as you want to make sure that the cartridge is properly sealed and that no air is leaking out. Make sure to screw the top cap back on tightly and to replace any O-rings that may have come loose.</p>

<h2>Step Five: Test the Cartridge</h2>

<p>The final step in repairing a broken wax cart is to test it. To do this, simply place the cartridge into your vaporizer and take a few puffs. If the vape is working properly, then the cartridge has been repaired and is ready to be used.</p>
