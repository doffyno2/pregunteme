<p>Skin turgor is the degree of elasticity in the skin when it is pulled and released. It is a measure of the skin's hydration and is an important indicator of overall health. Skin turgor is usually assessed by pinching a fold of skin on the back of the hand or on the abdomen. When skin turgor is decreased, it means that the skin is less elastic and may remain in a tented or raised position when released. Decreased skin turgor is a sign of dehydration, which can be caused by a variety of factors. It is also a sign of certain medical conditions, including diabetes, kidney disease, and malnutrition. </p>
