<p>The idea of enlisting in the military is both exciting and daunting, and many prospective recruits have questions about what they need to do in order to prepare. One of the most common questions relates to immunizations – can recruits get them before boot camp? The answer is, yes – although there are a few important things to consider.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Types of Immunizations Needed</h2>

<p>The military requires active duty and reserve personnel to receive certain immunizations, which are categorized as either core or non-core. Core immunizations are those that all members must receive, regardless of their duty station or conditions of deployment. Non-core immunizations are those that are recommended for certain duty stations or deployments, but are not required for all personnel. </p>

<h2>The Core Immunizations</h2>

<p>The core immunizations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hepatitis A</li>
<li>Hepatitis B</li>
<li>Influenza</li>
<li>Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR)</li>
<li>Meningococcal conjugate (MCV4 or MPSV4)</li>
<li>Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap)</li>
<li>Varicella (chickenpox)</li>
</ul>

<p>These immunizations are typically provided at a military healthcare facility, but many recruits find it beneficial to get them before boot camp. Doing so allows them to focus on their training without worrying about getting immunized.</p>

<h2>Getting Immunizations Before Boot Camp</h2>

<p>Recruits who wish to get their immunizations before boot camp can do so at any healthcare facility, including their doctor’s office, a local clinic, or a hospital. It is important to note, however, that the military requires recruits to receive their immunizations from a healthcare provider who is authorized by the Department of Defense (DoD). </p>

<p>The DoD provides a list of authorized healthcare providers who can administer the required immunizations. In addition, many military healthcare facilities offer pre-enlistment physicals and immunizations to prospective recruits. Recruits should make sure to bring their DD Form 2807-1 (the military’s pre-enlistment physical exam form) to the appointment.</p>

<h2>Non-Core Immunizations</h2>

<p>Non-core immunizations are recommended for individuals who are deployed to certain regions or are assigned to certain duties. These may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anthrax</li>
<li>Cholera</li>
<li>Japanese encephalitis</li>
<li>Plague</li>
<li>Rabies</li>
<li>Typhoid</li>
<li>Yellow fever</li>
</ul>

<p>The military recommends that recruits get these immunizations before they leave for their deployment. However, the decision to get these immunizations is ultimately up to the recruit and should be discussed with their healthcare provider.</p>
