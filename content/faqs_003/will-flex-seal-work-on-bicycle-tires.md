Will Flex Seal Work on Bicycle Tires?

Bicycle tires often experience a lot of wear and tear due to the terrain and conditions in which they are used. Not only do these tires need to provide enough traction to keep the cyclist safe, but they also need to be strong enough to resist punctures, tears, and other damage.
