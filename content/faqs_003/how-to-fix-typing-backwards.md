Typing backwards is a common problem caused by a number of factors. The most common cause is simply typing too quickly. When you type quickly, your fingers may accidentally press the wrong keys. This can cause you to type words or phrases backwards, or even whole sentences. Another common cause is that you may have mistakenly configured your keyboard to use a different language.

Finally, it could also be caused by a hardware issue with the keyboard itself, such as a stuck or damaged key.
