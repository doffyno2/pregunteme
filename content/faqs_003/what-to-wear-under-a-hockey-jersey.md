<p>Hockey is a fast-paced and intense sport, and it requires the right gear to help you stay safe and perform at your best. Wearing the right kind of clothing and equipment underneath your hockey jersey is essential for both safety and comfort. In this article, we’ll explain the different types of clothing and equipment that you should wear under your hockey jersey.</p>

<h2>Base Layer Clothing</h2>

<p>The most important thing to wear underneath your hockey jersey is a base layer. A base layer should be made of a material that is lightweight and breathable, such as polyester or lycra. It should also fit snugly against your body so that it can help wick away sweat and keep you cool. Base layers are designed to help keep your body temperature regulated, so it’s important to choose one that is well-fitted and comfortable.</p>

<p>If you are playing in cold weather, a long-sleeved base layer is recommended. It should fit close to your body, but not so tight that it restricts your movement. Look for a base layer that is made of a lightweight fabric such as polyester or wool, as these are more breathable and better suited for hockey. You may also want to consider wearing a base layer with padding in areas like the elbows and shoulders for extra protection.</p>

<h2>Compression Shirts & Pants</h2>

<p>Compression shirts and pants are another type of clothing that you can wear underneath your hockey jersey. Compression garments are designed to help improve your performance by providing support and reducing fatigue. They are made of a stretchy fabric that fits close to the body and helps reduce muscle soreness, as well as speed up recovery time. Compression garments also help keep you warm and dry by wicking away sweat and regulating body temperature.</p>

<p>Compression garments can be worn under your hockey jersey, but they should be loose enough to allow for full range of motion. You should also make sure that they are made of a breathable fabric such as polyester or spandex. If you are playing in cold weather, you may want to invest in a compression shirt and pants with additional padding for added protection.</p>

<h2>Protective Gear</h2>

<p>Protective gear such as shoulder pads, elbow pads, and shin guards are essential for playing hockey. They help protect you from injuries that could occur during the game. Make sure that your protective gear fits properly and is comfortable to wear. You should also check that the straps are securely fastened so that the gear does not move around during play.</p>

<p>If you are playing in cold weather, you may want to layer your protective gear with a compression shirt and pants for added warmth. You should also look for protective gear that is specifically designed for hockey, as this will provide better protection and fit than other types of protective gear.</p>

<h2>Thermal Underwear</h2>

<p>Thermal underwear is another type of clothing that you can wear under your hockey jersey. Thermal underwear is designed to keep you warm and dry by trapping in your body heat while wicking away moisture. It should be made of a lightweight, breathable fabric such as polyester or wool. It should also fit snugly against your body without being too tight or restricting your movement. Thermal underwear is a great way to keep warm in cold weather without having to layer on too many layers of clothing.</p>

<h2>Socks</h2>

<p>Socks are an often overlooked but essential part of hockey attire. They should be made of a moisture-wicking fabric such as polyester or wool. Look for socks that are specifically designed for hockey, as these are usually more comfortable and better fitting than regular socks. Make sure that the socks fit snugly against your feet and that they are not too tight or too loose.</p>

<h2>Skates</h2>

<p>The final piece of clothing that you should wear under your hockey jersey is a pair of skates. It’s important to choose a pair of skates that fit properly and provide adequate support. Your skates should fit snugly without being too tight or too loose. Make sure that the skates are well-maintained and that the blades are sharpened regularly.</p>
