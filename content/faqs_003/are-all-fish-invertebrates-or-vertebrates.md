<p>Fish are some of the most abundant and diverse species of animals on our planet. Not only are they found in oceans, rivers, and lakes, but they can also be found in more unusual places like hot springs and even in the Antarctic! However, something that many people don’t know is that fish can be divided into two main groups: invertebrates and vertebrates.</p>

<h2>What are Invertebrates?</h2>

<p>Invertebrates are animals that lack a backbone or spinal column. An estimated 97 percent of all living animal species are invertebrates, and this includes fish. Some common examples of invertebrate fish include lampreys, hagfish, and jellyfish. All of these fish are characterized by their lack of a bony skeleton and their generally softer bodies.</p>

<h2>What are Vertebrates?</h2>

<p>Vertebrates, on the other hand, are animals that have a backbone or spinal column. This includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. The majority of fish species are vertebrates and they are typically characterized by their hard, bony skeletons and streamlined bodies. Common examples of vertebrate fish include salmon, trout, and tuna.</p>

<h2>Which Fish are Invertebrates and Which Fish are Vertebrates?</h2>

<p>It’s important to note that not all fish are either invertebrates or vertebrates. Some fish, such as the lamprey, are both. The lamprey is an example of a “primitive” fish, which means that it has characteristics of both invertebrates and vertebrates. Other examples of primitive fish include hagfish and sturgeons.</p>

<p>In general, most of the fish that we are familiar with are vertebrates. This includes saltwater and freshwater fish, such as salmon, trout, catfish, bass, and many others. Invertebrate fish, on the other hand, are mostly found in the oceans and include species such as jellyfish, squid, and octopus.</p>

<h2>What are the Differences Between Invertebrate and Vertebrate Fish?</h2>

<p>The primary difference between invertebrate and vertebrate fish is their skeletal structure. Invertebrate fish, such as jellyfish and squid, have soft bodies with no bones or internal structure. Vertebrate fish, on the other hand, have a hard, bony skeleton and an internal structure that helps to support their bodies and maintain their shape. Another difference is in the way these fish feed. Invertebrate fish typically feed by filtering small particles out of the water. Vertebrate fish, on the other hand, feed by actively chasing and catching their prey.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it is important to note that not all fish are either invertebrates or vertebrates. Some fish, such as the lamprey, are both. In general, however, most of the fish that we are familiar with are vertebrates. This includes saltwater and freshwater fish, such as salmon, trout, catfish, bass, and many others. Invertebrate fish are mostly found in the oceans and include species such as jellyfish, squid, and octopus.</p>
