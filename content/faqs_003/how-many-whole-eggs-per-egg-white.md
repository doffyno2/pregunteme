<p>Eggs are a great source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, and are an essential ingredient of many recipes. But how many whole eggs can you have per egg white? It’s an important question if you’re trying to stay within a healthy diet. </p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the size and type of egg you’re using. The size of an egg is determined by the number of ounces it contains.
