<p>As Good As It Gets is a 1997 romantic comedy-drama starring Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear. The film was written and directed by James L. Brooks and tells the story of a misanthropic, obsessive-compulsive novelist, played by Nicholson, and the waitress, played by Hunt, and gay artist, played by Kinnear, with whom he develops a relationship. The film was a critical and commercial success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.</p>

<p>The film features a variety of animals, including a dog named Verdell. Verdell is a white Bichon Frise who is adopted by Nicholson’s character, Melvin Udall. Verdell is a critical part of the story, providing a source of comfort and companionship to Melvin in his moments of greatest need. Verdell is a source of joy and unconditional love for Melvin, who is often portrayed as being emotionally isolated and unable to express his feelings. Verdell’s presence in Melvin’s life serves as a reminder of the importance of human connection.</p>

<p>Verdell was played by a real-life Bichon Frise named Tramp. Tramp was found at a pet store in California and was adopted by the film’s animal trainer, Bill Koehler. The film’s director, James L. Brooks, was so taken with Tramp’s performance that he decided to keep him on the set for the duration of the shoot. Tramp became a favorite on the set and developed a close bond with Jack Nicholson, who took an instant liking to him.</p>

<p>Tramp was trained to perform a variety of tasks, including sitting, staying, fetching, and responding to verbal commands. He was also trained to do something that is not seen in the film—to kiss Jack Nicholson on the lips! Tramp was reportedly so well-trained that he was able to perform his tasks without a leash or an animal trainer present.</p>
