<p>Citizen Eco-Drive watches are some of the most popular watches on the market. They are powered by light, so they never need to be recharged or have batteries replaced. However, sometimes they may stop working or become unresponsive. If this has happened to your Citizen Eco-Drive watch, there are a few steps you can take to get it working again.</p>

<h2>Check the Battery</h2>

<p>The first step is to check the battery. Citizen Eco-Drive watches use a special type of battery called a photocell. This battery is charged by light and does not need to be replaced. However, the battery can sometimes become weak or depleted. If the watch is unresponsive, it could be due to a weak battery.</p> 

<p>To check the battery, you will need to open the back of the watch. This can usually be done with a small screwdriver. Once the back is open, you should be able to see the battery. If it looks old or worn, it may need to be replaced. You can buy replacement batteries at most watch stores.</p>

<h2>Clean the Contacts</h2>

<p>If the battery looks fine, the next step is to check the contacts. The contacts are the small metal pieces that connect the battery to the watch. Over time, dirt and debris can build up on the contacts, preventing the watch from functioning properly. To clean the contacts, you will need a small brush or cloth.</p>

<p>Gently brush or wipe away any dirt or debris that may have accumulated on the contacts. If you have access to a can of compressed air, you can also use it to blow away any dust or dirt that may be trapped in the contacts.</p>

<h2>Check the Time Setting</h2>

<p>If the contacts are clean and the battery is working properly, then the next step is to check the time setting. A Citizen Eco-Drive watch has an internal clock that is powered by the battery. If the clock has stopped, then the watch will not work properly. To reset the clock, you will need to press the reset button on the watch.</p>

<p>Once you have pressed the reset button, the clock should start working again. If the watch still does not work, then you may need to take it to a watch repair shop for further inspection.</p>
