<h2>Mt Fuji’s Height in Miles</h2>

Mt Fuji is approximately 2.3 miles tall. That’s about 3,818 meters or 12,526 feet. To put that in perspective, Mt Fuji is about 6,000 feet taller than the Empire State Building in New York City and is almost as tall as the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

<h2>How Do We Measure Mountain Height?</h2>

A mountain's height is typically measured from its base to its summit. This is known as its elevation. Elevation is expressed in either feet or meters, depending on the measuring system used. In the case of Mt Fuji, the mountain's elevation is expressed in meters. 

<h2>What Is the Difference Between Height and Elevation?</h2>

Height and elevation are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Height is the distance from the ground to the top of the mountain, while elevation is the distance from the base of the mountain to its summit. To put it another way, height is the vertical distance from a mountain's base to its summit, while elevation is the height above sea level. 

<h2>What Is the Difference Between Feet and Meters?</h2>

The metric system is the most widely used system of measurement in the world. In this system, distances are measured in meters (m) or kilometers (km). The imperial system, which is used in the United States and the United Kingdom, measures distances in feet (ft) or miles (mi). One meter is equal to 3.28 feet, and one mile is equal to 5,280 feet. 

<h2>What Is the Height of Other Famous Mountains?</h2>

Mt Everest is the highest mountain in the world, with an elevation of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet). Other famous mountains include Kilimanjaro in Tanzania (5,895 meters or 19,341 feet), Mount Elbrus in Russia (5,642 meters or 18,510 feet), Mount McKinley in Alaska (6,194 meters or 20,320 feet), and Mont Blanc in France (4,810 meters or 15,781 feet).
