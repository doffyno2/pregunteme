<p>Are you looking to build a bigger chest? If so, you’ve probably heard that push ups are one of the best exercises for building chest muscles. But how many push ups per day should you do in order to see results? The answer isn’t as simple as you might think. </p>

<p>First of all, it’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Everyone is different and has different goals, so the number of push ups you should do each day will depend on your own unique situation. That being said, there are some general guidelines you can use to figure out how many push ups per day you should aim for.</p>

<h2>Factors To Consider When Doing Push Ups</h2>

<p>Before you decide how many push ups you should do per day, there are a few things you should consider. First, you need to think about your current fitness level. If you’re just starting out, it’s best to start with a smaller number of push ups and gradually increase the number as you get stronger. On the other hand, if you’re already in shape, you can probably handle a higher number of push ups right away. </p>

<p>You should also take into consideration any other activities you do throughout the day. If you already do a lot of strength training or cardio, you may want to do fewer push ups to avoid overtraining. On the other hand, if you don’t do any other activities, you can get away with doing more push ups.</p>

<p>Finally, think about your goals. If you’re trying to build muscle, you’ll need to do more push ups than someone who just wants to stay in shape.  </p>

<h2>How Many Push Ups Should You Do?</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve taken into consideration all the factors mentioned above, you can start to figure out how many push ups you should do each day. Generally speaking, you should aim for around 50-100 push ups per day if you’re just starting out. As you get stronger, you can gradually increase the number of push ups you do each day. </p>

<p>If you’re already in shape and want to build muscle, you should aim for around 100-200 push ups per day. Again, it’s important to start slowly and gradually increase the number as you get stronger. </p>

<p>Regardless of your current fitness level, it’s important to take breaks in between sets of push ups. This will give your muscles time to rest and recover, which will help you get the most out of your workouts. </p>

<h2>Tips for Doing Push Ups </h2>

<p>In addition to knowing how many push ups you should do each day, it’s also important to know how to do them correctly. Here are a few tips to keep in mind: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Be sure to keep your body in a straight line from head to toe. </li>
    <li>Keep your elbows close to your sides and don’t let them flare out. </li>
    <li>Don’t let your hips sink towards the floor. </li>
    <li>Keep your core engaged throughout the movement. </li>
    <li>Focus on squeezing your chest muscles at the top of the movement. </li>
