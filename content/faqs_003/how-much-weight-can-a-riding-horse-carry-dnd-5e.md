<p>The 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a popular role playing game that has been around since 1974. One of the most popular aspects of the game involves the use of mounts, such as horses, to traverse the world. But how much weight can a riding horse carry in D&D 5E?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on many factors, such as the size and strength of the horse, the weight of the rider, and the amount of gear the rider is carrying. In general, the maximum weight a riding horse can carry in D&D 5E is determined by its Strength score. The Strength of a horse is rated on a scale of 1 to 30, with 30 being the strongest. A Strength of 30 means the horse can carry up to 600 pounds of weight, including the rider and any gear they are carrying. </p>

<p>However, it's important to note that this is just the maximum weight a riding horse can carry. Depending on the situation, a horse may not be able to carry the full 600 pounds. For example, if the terrain is difficult or the horse is fatigued, the horse may not be able to carry the full weight. </p>

<p>In addition to the Strength score of the horse, the size and weight of the rider also plays a factor in how much weight a riding horse can carry. A large, heavy rider may be too much for a horse with a lower Strength score. A smaller, lighter rider may be able to ride a horse with a higher Strength score. </p>

<p>Finally, the amount of gear a rider is carrying also plays a role in how much weight a riding horse can carry. The more gear a rider is carrying, the less weight the horse can carry. It's important to consider the weight of the gear when calculating the maximum weight a riding horse can carry in D&D 5E.</p>

<h2>Horse Strength and Weight Capacity</h2>

<p>The Strength score of a horse is the most important factor when determining how much weight a riding horse can carry in D&D 5E. As mentioned above, a Strength score of 30 means the horse can carry up to 600 pounds, including the rider and any gear they are carrying. Here is a breakdown of the different Strength scores and their corresponding maximum weight capacity:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Strength Score 1:</b> 50 pounds</li>
<li><b>Strength Score 2:</b> 100 pounds</li>
<li><b>Strength Score 3:</b> 150 pounds</li>
<li><b>Strength Score 4:</b> 200 pounds</li>
<li><b>Strength Score 5:</b> 250 pounds</li>
