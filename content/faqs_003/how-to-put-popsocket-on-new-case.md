<p>PopSockets are becoming increasingly popular with phone and tablet users. They provide a secure grip for your device, and they look cool, too! But how do you put a PopSocket on a brand new phone case?</p>

<p>It's actually very easy to do. All you need is the PopSocket, some rubbing alcohol, and a few minutes of your time. Here's what you need to do:</p>

<h2>Step One: Clean the PopSocket</h2>

<p>The first step is to clean the PopSocket. You can do this with a bit of rubbing alcohol and a soft cloth. Make sure to clean the adhesive side of the PopSocket, as this is the side that will be sticking to your phone case.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Remove the Adhesive Backing</h2>

<p>Once the PopSocket is clean, it's time to remove the adhesive backing. This is easily done by simply peeling it off. Be careful not to touch the adhesive side of the PopSocket, as this can affect its ability to stick to the phone case.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Apply the PopSocket to the Case</h2>

<p>Once the adhesive backing is removed, you can go ahead and apply the PopSocket to the phone case. Make sure to hold the PopSocket firmly in place until it is firmly stuck to the case. If necessary, you can use a bit of pressure to help the PopSocket stick.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Allow the PopSocket to Set</h2>

<p>After the PopSocket is in place, you should let it sit for a few minutes to allow the adhesive to set properly. This will ensure that the PopSocket stays firmly in place and wonâ€™t come off easily.</p>
