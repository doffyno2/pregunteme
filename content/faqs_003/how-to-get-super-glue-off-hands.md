<p>Super glue is an incredibly sticky adhesive, capable of bonding materials together in seconds. The same property that makes it so great for crafts and repairs can be a real problem when it comes in contact with skin. Fortunately, there are a few different methods that can help you get super glue off your hands quickly and easily.</p>

<h2>Using Acetone</h2>

<p>The most common method for removing super glue from skin is to use an acetone-based solvent. Acetone is the main ingredient in most nail polish removers and can be found at most drug stores. To use it, simply soak a cotton ball or rag in acetone and place it on the glue-covered skin for about a minute. The acetone should break down the glue, making it easier to remove. Once the glue has softened, you can gently peel it off with your fingers.</p>

<h2>Using Rubbing Alcohol</h2>

<p>If you don't have access to acetone, you can also try using rubbing alcohol. Soak a cotton ball or rag in rubbing alcohol and place it on the glue-covered skin for about a minute. This should help to break down the glue, making it easier to remove. Once the glue has softened, you can gently peel it off with your fingers.</p>

<h2>Using Soap and Water</h2>

<p>If neither acetone nor rubbing alcohol is available, you can try using soap and water. Soak the affected area in warm, soapy water for about five minutes. This should help break down the glue and make it easier to remove. Once the glue has softened, you can gently peel it off with your fingers.</p>

<h2>Using Petroleum Jelly</h2>

<p>If you don't have access to any of the above-mentioned solvents, you can also try using petroleum jelly. Simply apply a generous amount of petroleum jelly to the affected area and let it sit for about five minutes. This should help to break down the glue and make it easier to remove. Once the glue has softened, you can gently peel it off with your fingers.</p>

<h2>Using Wax Paper</h2>

<p>If nothing else works, you can also try using wax paper. Place a sheet of wax paper over the affected area and press down lightly. This should help break down the glue and make it easier to remove. Once the glue has softened, you can gently peel it off with your fingers.</p>
