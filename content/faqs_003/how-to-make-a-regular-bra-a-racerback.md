<p>For those of us with larger busts, finding a comfortable and supportive bra can be a challenge. Racerback bras are especially popular for providing comfort and support, but they come with a price tag that can be out of reach for many of us. Luckily, you don’t have to break the bank to get the support you need. With a few simple steps, you can quickly and easily convert your existing regular bra into a racerback.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>
<p>To convert your regular bra into a racerback, you will need the following items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A regular bra</li>
  <li>Two small pieces of elastic</li>
  <li>Needle and thread</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step One: Measure and Cut the Elastic</h2>
<p>The first step is to measure and cut the two pieces of elastic. Measure the elastic so that it fits snugly around the back of the bra. Cut two pieces of the same size, and make sure they are both the same length. Once you have cut the elastic, use the needle and thread to sew the two pieces together.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Attach the Elastic to the Bra</h2>
<p>The next step is to attach the elastic to the back of the bra. To do this, take one end of the elastic and pin it to the back of the bra. Make sure the elastic is securely attached, and then sew it into place. Do the same with the other end of the elastic. Make sure the elastic is snug, but not too tight.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Adjust and Secure the Elastic</h2>
<p>Once the elastic is attached to the back of the bra, it’s time to adjust and secure it. Take the elastic and adjust it so that it fits snugly around your body. Once you’re happy with the fit, use the needle and thread to secure it in place.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Check the Fit</h2>
<p>The final step is to check the fit of your new racerback bra. Try it on to make sure it fits comfortably and securely. If it doesn’t fit quite right, you may need to adjust the elastic or add more. Once you’re satisfied with the fit, you’re ready to go.</p>
