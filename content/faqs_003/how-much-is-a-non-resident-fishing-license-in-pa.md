The short answer to this question is that the cost of a non-resident fishing license in Pennsylvania is $22.90 for a one-day license, $31.90 for a three-day license, and $51.90 for an annual license. However, there are a few additional details to consider before purchasing a license, such as what type of fish you’re looking to catch, which body of water you plan to fish in, and whether you’ll be fishing with a boat or from the shore. 

<h2>Types of Fish</h2>

The cost of your fishing license depends on what type of fish you’re looking to catch. A non-resident fishing license allows you to target trout, bass, walleye, muskellunge, and other warm-water and cool-water species of fish. If you’re looking to catch panfish (also known as panfish species), such as crappie and bluegills, you’ll need to purchase an additional panfish license for $11.90.

<h2>Body of Water</h2>

The cost of a non-resident fishing license also depends on which body of water you plan to fish in. If you’re fishing on Lake Erie or in any of the other Great Lakes, you’ll need to purchase a Great Lakes Trout and Salmon Stamp for an additional $10.90. If you plan to fish in any other public water in Pennsylvania, you’ll need to purchase a Lake Erie Permit for an additional $5.90.

<h2>Boat or Shore Fishing</h2>

If you plan to fish from a boat, you’ll need to purchase an additional Boat Fishing Permit for an additional $11.90. If you plan to fish from the shore, this permit is not necessary.
