<p>The African Wild Dog has had a long and storied history on the African continent, with the first specimens being recorded in the late 19th century. Since then, the species has become an iconic symbol of the African wilderness and its unique and endangered ecosystem. For centuries, the species has been feared and revered in African cultures, with many believing that it was a hybrid of hyena and wild dog. But is this actually true?</p>

<h2>What Is An African Wild Dog?</h2> 

<p>The African Wild Dog, or Lycaon pictus, is a large carnivore which is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is the largest species of canid in Africa and is an extremely efficient hunter. It is believed to be the most social of all canids, living in packs of between 6 and 20 individuals. African Wild Dog packs are highly territorial and will defend their territories fiercely. </p>

<h2>What Is A Hyena?</h2> 

<p>The Hyena, or Hyaenidae, is a family of carnivorous mammals which is native to Africa and Asia. There are four species of hyenas, all of which are found in Africa. The most common species is the spotted hyena, or Crocuta crocuta, which is the largest and most successful of the hyena species. Hyenas are known for their vocalisations and for their scavenging habits.</p>

<h2>The History of the African Wild Dog/Hyena Hybrid Theory</h2> 

<p>The belief that the African Wild Dog is a hybrid of hyena and wild dog has been around for centuries. It stems from the fact that the African Wild Dog shares many characteristics with both the hyena and wild dog. For example, they are both highly social animals and they both hunt in packs. Additionally, the African Wild Dog has a similar coat to the spotted hyena and is larger than the average wild dog. All of these similarities led some people to believe that the African Wild Dog was a hybrid species.</p>

<h2>The Truth Behind the Hybrid Theory</h2> 

<p>Despite the similarities between the African Wild Dog and hyena, the two species are not closely related. Scientific studies have shown that the African Wild Dog is not a hybrid species. Instead, it is a distinct species which evolved from an ancient canid ancestor. The closest relative of the African Wild Dog is the African golden wolf, which is found in North Africa.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 

<p>The African Wild Dog is not a hybrid of hyena and wild dog. Instead, it is a distinct species which evolved from an ancient canid ancestor. Despite the similarities between the two species, they are not closely related. The African Wild Dog is an iconic species which is an important part of the African ecosystem and it is important that we do all we can to protect and conserve this unique species.</p>
