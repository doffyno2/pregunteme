<p>Smart Water is a brand of bottled water owned by the Coca-Cola company. It is marketed as a premium product with a variety of health benefits, including increased hydration and better electrolyte balance. But what is the pH of Smart Water?</p>

<p>The pH of Smart Water is 7.4, which means it is slightly alkaline. The pH of Smart Water is achieved through the addition of electrolytes, specifically magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride and potassium bicarbonate. These electrolytes help to create an optimal hydration balance in the body, as well as providing a slightly alkaline pH.</p>

<p>The alkalinity of Smart Water is beneficial to the body as it helps to maintain a healthy pH balance in the body's cells. This helps to prevent acidosis, a condition in which the body becomes too acidic. An acidic environment can lead to fatigue, headaches, and other health problems.</p>

<p>Smart Water also contains electrolytes that help the body to absorb water more efficiently. This means that a person can stay hydrated for longer than with regular water. Additionally, electrolytes can help to replenish electrolyte levels that are lost due to exercise, sweating, and other activities.</p>

<p>In addition to its alkaline pH and electrolytes, Smart Water also contains other minerals, such as calcium and magnesium. These minerals help to replace minerals lost through sweat or other activities. Magnesium, for example, helps to reduce cramps and can even improve sleep quality.</p>

<p>Smart Water also contains a small amount of sodium, which is beneficial for those who need to monitor their sodium intake. The amount of sodium in Smart Water is much lower than in regular bottled water, making it a better choice for those who are trying to limit their sodium intake.</p>

<p>Overall, Smart Water is an excellent choice for those looking for a healthy, natural source of hydration. Its alkaline pH and electrolytes help to maintain a healthy pH balance in the body and provide an excellent source of minerals. Additionally, Smart Water is low in sodium, making it a better choice for those who need to monitor their sodium intake.</p>
