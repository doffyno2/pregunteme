<p>Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are a must-have for any driver who values safety and long-term savings on fuel costs. TPMS monitors the pressure and temperature of your tires, and alerts you when something is amiss. But as with any part of your car, eventually you may need to repair or replace your TPMS. So how much does it cost to repair TPMS?</p>

<p>The cost of TPMS repair will vary depending on the type of repair required and the make and model of your car. If you need to replace a faulty TPMS sensor, it could cost anywhere between $50 and $200 per tire. If the TPMS system needs to be reset or recalibrated due to a software issue, the cost could be between $50 and $150. If the TPMS module needs to be replaced, you may have to pay up to $1,000 for the repair.</p>

<p>In some cases, it may be cheaper to replace the entire TPMS system than repair it. If you have an older car that doesn’t have a TPMS system, you may have to pay for the installation of a new TPMS system. This could cost anywhere from $100 to $400, depending on the make and model of your car.</p>
