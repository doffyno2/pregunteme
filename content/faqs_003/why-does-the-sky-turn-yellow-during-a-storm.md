<p>Have you ever looked up at the sky during a storm and noticed that it has a yellow hue to it? If so, you’re not alone. This phenomenon is common during thunderstorms and is caused by the presence of dust, smoke, and other particles in the atmosphere. In this article, we’ll take a deeper look at why the sky turns yellow during a storm and what you can do to protect yourself from the weather. </p>

<h2>What Causes the Sky to Turn Yellow During a Storm?</h2>

<p>When a storm moves in, the sky can take on a unique yellow hue. This is due to the presence of dust, smoke, and other particles in the atmosphere. These particles reflect and scatter the sunlight, causing the sky to look yellow rather than its usual blue. </p>

<p>Particles in the atmosphere can also absorb some of the sunlight’s energy. This absorbed energy is then re-emitted as heat, which warms the air around us. This warming can create an updraft, which helps to push the storm clouds higher in the sky. This can also make the storm clouds appear more yellow. </p>

<p>Another reason the sky may appear yellow during a storm is due to the presence of ice crystals in the clouds. The ice crystals can refract the sunlight, causing the sky to take on a yellow hue. </p>

<h2>What Can You Do to Protect Yourself During a Storm?</h2>

<p>When the sky turns yellow during a storm, it’s important to take the necessary precautions to ensure your safety. Before a storm, be sure to secure any loose items in your yard, such as patio furniture or outdoor decorations. Additionally, it’s important to bring any pets indoors and to secure all windows and doors. </p>

<p>During a storm, be sure to stay indoors if possible. If you must go outside, be sure to stay away from large trees and power lines. Additionally, it’s important to avoid driving in flooded areas. </p>
