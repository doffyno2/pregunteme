Do you ever find yourself wondering what comes first in pants size? Are you confused about the order of the two measurements, waist and inseam? Don't worry, you're not alone. In this article, we'll be taking a look at what comes first in pants size and why it matters. 

<h2>What Is Pant Size?</h2>

Pant size is typically a combination of two measurements, waist and inseam. Waist size is the measurement around your waistline and inseam is the measurement from the crotch of your pants to the bottom of your leg. When combined, these two measurements tell you the size of your pants. For example, “34x30” would indicate that your waist size is 34 inches and your inseam is 30 inches. 

<h2>What Comes First in Pants Size?</h2>

When it comes to pants size, the waist measurement comes first and the inseam measurement comes second. For example, if your waist size is 34 inches and your inseam is 30 inches, your pants size would be written as “34x30”.
