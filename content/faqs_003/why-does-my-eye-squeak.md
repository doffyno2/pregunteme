<p>Have you ever found yourself wondering why your eye suddenly starts to squeak? While it may seem like a bizarre phenomenon, it is actually a fairly common occurrence. It’s important to understand what’s causing the squeaking, so that you can take the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again.</p>

<h2>What Causes Squeaking Eyes?</h2>

<p>The most common cause of squeaking eyes is dryness. When the eyes become too dry, the eyelids can rub against the surface of the eye, causing a squeaking sound. This is because the eyelids are not lubricated enough to move smoothly across the eye surface. In addition, the dryness can cause the eyelids to become inflamed and irritated, which can also lead to squeaking.</p>

<p>Another possible cause of squeaking eyes is an infection. Certain types of infections, such as conjunctivitis, can cause inflammation of the eyelids, which can lead to squeaking. In addition, certain types of allergies can also cause the eyelids to become irritated and inflamed, resulting in the same squeaking sound.</p>

<p>Finally, certain types of eye surgery, such as laser eye surgery, can cause the eyelids to become dry and irritated, resulting in the same squeaking sound. In some cases, the squeaking can be caused by the anesthesia used during the surgery.</p>

<h2>How to Prevent Squeaking Eyes</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent squeaking eyes is to make sure that your eyes remain properly lubricated. This can be done by using artificial tears, which are available over-the-counter. It is also important to make sure that you are drinking plenty of water throughout the day, as this can help to keep the eyes hydrated.</p>

<p>If you are prone to allergies, it is important to make sure that you are taking the necessary steps to prevent them from occurring. This may include avoiding certain triggers, such as dust or pollen, and taking allergy medication. In addition, if you have recently undergone eye surgery, it is important to make sure that you are following the instructions provided by your doctor to ensure that your eyes remain healthy and lubricated.</p>

<h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>

<p>If your eyes continue to squeak despite taking the necessary steps to prevent it, it is important to see a doctor. In some cases, the squeaking may be a sign of a more serious underlying medical condition, such as an infection or an allergy. Your doctor can help to diagnose the cause of the problem and provide you with the appropriate treatment.</p>
