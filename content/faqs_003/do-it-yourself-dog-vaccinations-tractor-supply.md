<h2>What Are Dog Vaccinations?</h2>

Dog vaccinations are an essential part of your dog's health. Vaccines protect your pup from a variety of infectious diseases and illnesses. They are a necessary part of preventative care for all dogs, regardless of breed or lifestyle. Vaccines are particularly important for puppies, as their immune systems are still developing and they are more susceptible to infection.

Vaccines work by introducing a small amount of dead or weakened virus, bacteria, or toxin into the body. This triggers an immune response from the body, which helps build up immunity to the disease or illness. This is why it's important to keep up with your dog's vaccination schedule.
