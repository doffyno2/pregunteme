<p>Cooking can be a tricky business, especially when you’re dealing with different temperatures and stove settings. If you’re new to cooking or simply want to brush up on your cooking skills, understanding the different temperatures on a stove can be a great first step. One of the most common settings is medium-high heat, which can be identified by a number on many stoves. Here’s a guide to help you understand what medium-high heat is and how to use it.</p>

<h2>What is Medium High Heat?</h2>

<p>Medium-high heat falls somewhere between medium and high heat on a stove. On many stoves, medium-high heat is represented by the number “7” on the knob, though this may vary depending on the stove you’re using. Medium-high heat should be hot enough to cause some sizzling, but not too hot that your food is burning in a matter of seconds. This setting is best used when you want to quickly cook a food item such as a steak, hamburger, or chicken breast.</p>

<h2>What Temperature is Medium High Heat?</h2>

<p>The exact temperature of medium-high heat is difficult to pinpoint as it can vary depending on the type of stove you’re using. Generally speaking, however, medium-high heat is around 375-425 degrees Fahrenheit (or 190-220 degrees Celsius).</p>

<h2>What Foods Should You Cook on Medium High Heat?</h2>

<p>Medium-high heat is best used for cooking foods that require a relatively short cooking time. This includes items such as steak, chicken, hamburgers, and pork chops. Additionally, medium-high heat is great for quickly sautéing vegetables such as bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Foods that require a longer cooking time, such as roasts or stews, should be cooked on lower temperatures.</p>

<h2>How To Tell When Your Food is Done on Medium High Heat?</h2>

<p>The best way to tell when your food is done on medium-high heat is to use a thermometer. A thermometer is the most accurate way to measure the internal temperature of your food and will help you avoid under or over-cooking. For meats, you should refrain from eating the food until it has reached a safe internal temperature according to the USDA.</p>

<h2>Tips For Cooking on Medium High Heat</h2>

<p>When cooking on medium-high heat, there are a few tips to remember. First, make sure that you’re using a good quality pan such as stainless steel or cast iron as these will conduct and hold heat better than other materials. Additionally, make sure that your pan is preheated before adding your food to it. Finally, keep an eye on your food to make sure it doesn’t overcook and burn. </p>
