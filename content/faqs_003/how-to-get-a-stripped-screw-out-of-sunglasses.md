<p>It can be incredibly frustrating when you’re trying to fix your sunglasses and the screws just won’t budge. This is especially true if the screws have become stripped and you can’t seem to get them out. Fortunately, there are some easy ways to get a stripped screw out of sunglasses and get your glasses looking good as new.</p>

<h2>Using Screwdrivers</h2>

<p>If you’re dealing with a stripped screw head, the first thing you should try is using a screwdriver. Start by selecting the correct size and type of screwdriver for the job. Flathead screwdrivers are the most common type and are usually the first choice when dealing with a stripped screw. If a flathead isn’t doing the job, then you may need to look into using a Phillips-head screwdriver. </p>

<p>Once you’ve selected the right screwdriver, it’s time to try and remove the screw. Insert the flathead or Phillips-head screwdriver into the head of the screw and turn it gently to the left. If the screw is only slightly stripped, this should do the trick and you should be able to get the screw out without any further assistance. </p>

<p>If the screw is more severely stripped, however, you may need to use a pair of pliers to turn the screwdriver. Insert the screwdriver into the head of the screw and then use the pliers to turn the screwdriver to the left. This should provide enough torque to loosen the screw and allow you to remove it from the frame. </p>

<h2>Using a Dremel Tool</h2>

<p>If the screw is still proving stubborn, then you may need to resort to more drastic measures. One option is to use a Dremel tool to cut away the head of the screw. Start by selecting the correct cutting bit for the job. A carbide cutting bit should work well for this task. </p>

<p>Once you’ve selected the right bit, insert it into the Dremel tool and then begin cutting away the head of the screw. Make sure to keep the tool steady and to move slowly and methodically as you cut away the head. Once you’ve cut away enough of the head, the screw should be loose enough to remove with your fingers. </p>

<h2>Using a Drill Bit</h2>

<p>If a Dremel tool isn’t an option, then you can also try using a drill bit. Start by selecting a drill bit that is slightly larger than the head of the screw. Once you’ve selected the right bit, insert it into the drill and begin drilling into the head of the screw. </p>

<p>As you drill, the bit will begin to remove the head of the screw and the screw should eventually become loose enough to remove. Be sure to move slowly and methodically as you drill, as it’s important to not drill too deep and damage the frame of the glasses. </p>
