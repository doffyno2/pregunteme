<p>Measuring an iPad screen is not as complicated as it may seem. In fact, it can be done with a few simple steps. In this article, we’ll walk through the process of accurately measuring an iPad screen. </p>

<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>

<p>Before you get started, you’ll need to gather a few items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A ruler (metric or imperial)</li>
  <li>A pen or pencil</li>
  <li>A piece of paper</li>
  <li>Your iPad</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step One: Measure the Width</h2>

<p>The first step in measuring your iPad screen is to measure the width. Place your ruler along the top edge of the screen, making sure the ruler is straight. The width of the iPad screen is the number of centimeters or inches (depending on which ruler you’re using) that fit across the top of the screen. </p>

<h2>Step Two: Measure the Height</h2>

<p>Next, you’ll need to measure the height of the iPad screen. Place the ruler along the left side of the screen, making sure the ruler is straight.
