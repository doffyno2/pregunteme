<p>It's not uncommon for dog owners to witness their canine companions displaying what appears to be dominant behavior toward one another, most often when one dog stands over the other. It's important to understand the reasons behind this behavior, as well as how to respond appropriately if it becomes a problem. </p>

<h2>What Does It Mean When a Dog Stands Over Another Dog?</h2>

<p>When a dog stands over another dog, it is usually a sign of dominance. A dominant dog may stand over another dog in order to appear larger and to assert their authority. The dog standing on top may also be using their body weight to push the other dog down. This behavior is often seen in multi-dog households, where one dog is vying for dominance over the other. </p>

<p>It's important to note that this behavior is not always a sign of aggression. In some cases, dogs may stand over each other in order to show affection. For example, one dog may stand over the other to lick their face or to lay their head on the other dog's neck. This is typically a sign of affection and not a sign of dominance. </p>

<h2>When Does This Behavior Become a Problem?</h2>

<p>While this behavior is usually not a problem when dogs are displaying signs of affection, it can become a problem if it is used as a form of aggression. If the dominant dog is standing over the other dog in an aggressive manner, it is important to take action to prevent the behavior from escalating. </p>

<p>In some cases, the dominant dog may growl or bark while standing over the other dog. This is a sign that the dominant dog is trying to assert their authority over the other dog. If this behavior is allowed to continue, it can lead to physical aggression and even fights. </p>

<h2>How to Address Dominant Dog Behavior</h2>

<p>If you notice that your dog is exhibiting dominant behavior, it is important to take action to stop it. The first step is to make sure that your dog is getting enough exercise and mental stimulation. Dogs that are bored or have pent-up energy can be more likely to engage in aggressive behaviors. </p>

<p>It is also important to make sure that your dog understands that you are the pack leader. If your dog does not understand that you are the one in charge, they may attempt to assert their dominance over other dogs in the household. </p>

<p>If your dog is exhibiting aggressive behavior toward another dog, it is important to intervene immediately. If possible, separate the dogs and provide each with their own space. This will help to prevent any further aggression. </p>

<p>It is also important to provide consistent and clear commands to your dog. This will help them to understand that you are the one in charge and that they are not allowed to engage in aggressive behaviors. </p>
