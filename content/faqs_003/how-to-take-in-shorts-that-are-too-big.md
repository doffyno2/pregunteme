<p>Shorts are a wardrobe staple when the weather is hot and humid. But if you've purchased shorts that are too big for you, don't worry â€“ there are ways to take them in so that they fit you perfectly. Taking in shorts may seem like a daunting task, but with a few basic sewing supplies and some patience, you can have a perfect fit in no time.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<p>You'll need to gather a few materials before you start taking in your shorts. You'll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sewing machine</li>
  <li>thread</li>
  <li>pins</li>
  <li>scissors</li>
  <li>seam ripper</li>
  <li>measuring tape</li>
  <li>a piece of chalk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Measure Your Shorts</h2>

<p>Before you start taking in your shorts, measure them to determine how much fabric needs to be taken in. Measure the waistband, the waistband seam, and the length of the shorts. Make a note of these measurements so that you can compare them to your desired measurements after you've taken in the shorts.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Take Out the Seams</h2>

<p>Most shorts have two seams that run along the sides of the waistband. Use a seam ripper to carefully remove these seams. Be careful not to cut any of the fabric as you remove the seams.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Take In the Fabric</h2>

<p>Once the seams have been removed, it's time to start taking in the fabric. You can do this by pinning the fabric in place and then using a sewing machine to stitch along the pinned edge. Make sure that you are taking in an even amount of fabric on both sides so that the shorts look symmetrical.</p>

<p>When taking in the fabric, it's important to keep the waistband seam in place. Make sure that you are only taking in the fabric along the sides of the waistband, not the seam itself.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Hem the Shorts</h2>

<p>Once you've taken in the fabric, you'll need to hem the shorts. To do this, measure the length of the shorts and mark where you would like to hem them. You can use a piece of chalk to make a mark on the fabric. Then, fold the fabric at the mark and pin it in place.</p>

<p>Once you have the fabric pinned, use a sewing machine to stitch along the pinned edge. When you're done, trim off any excess fabric with a pair of scissors.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Check Your Work</h2>

<p>Once you've finished hemming and taking in the shorts, it's time to check your work. Put on the shorts and compare the measurements that you took before you started to the measurements you took after you finished. If the measurements are the same, then you know you've done a good job.</p>
