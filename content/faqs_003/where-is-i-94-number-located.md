<p>An I-94 number, also known as an Arrival-Departure Record Number, is a unique number assigned to foreign nationals who are admitted to the United States. The I-94 number is used to track the departure and arrival dates of individuals and to verify the terms and conditions of their stay in the U.S. The I-94 number is issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon entry and must be presented to government agencies or employers in order to prove lawful admission to the country.</p>

<p>The I-94 number is a critical document for any foreign national who is living and working in the United States. It is used to verify identity and immigration status, and it is necessary when applying for certain government benefits or services, such as Social Security benefits or a driver’s license. In addition, employers use the I-94 number to verify the work authorization of their foreign employees.</p>

The I-94 number may also be printed on the back of the passport or visa.</p>
