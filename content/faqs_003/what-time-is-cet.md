Most people have heard of Central European Time (CET) but they may not know what it is or how it works. CET is an important time zone used by many countries in Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.

<h2>What is CET?</h2>

Central European Time (CET) is a time zone that covers countries in Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.

CET is used as the official time by many countries in Europe, and is also used to set clocks in many other parts of the world.

<h2>How Does CET Work?</h2>

CET works by setting a standard time for the countries it covers. This standard time is used to set clocks in the countries that are part of the time zone, as well as in other countries around the world. CET is one hour ahead of UTC and seven hours ahead of EST.

<h2>How Do I Convert CET to My Local Time?</h2>

If you need to convert CET to your local time, you can use an online time zone converter. This will allow you to enter CET and your local time and it will calculate the difference between the two. You can then use this difference to adjust your clock to the correct time. 

<h2>When Does CET Start and End?</h2>

CET is a fixed time zone that does not observe daylight saving time. This means that the time in CET remains the same throughout the year. CET starts at 01:00 UTC on the first Sunday of April and ends at 01:00 UTC on the last Sunday of October.
