<p>Removing a belly button ring that won’t unscrew can be a frustrating experience. Whether you’ve had a piercing for years, or you’re just getting one, it’s important to know the proper way to remove the jewelry. The last thing you want is to damage your piercing or jewelry. Here’s how to remove a belly button ring that won’t unscrew.</p>

<h2>Why Won’t My Belly Button Ring Unscrew?</h2>

<p>Before you attempt to remove your belly button ring, it’s important to understand why it’s stuck in the first place. There are several reasons why belly button rings won’t unscrew.

<h2>Tools Needed to Remove a Belly Button Ring</h2>

<p>Once you have the necessary tools, it’s time to remove the belly button ring. The first step is to put on the rubber gloves. This will protect your hands from the jewelry and any bacteria that may be on the jewelry. Next, use the needle-nose pliers to grip the ball of the jewelry. Be sure to grip the ball firmly, but not too tightly. Once you have a good grip, gently twist the pliers in a counter-clockwise motion. If the jewelry still won’t budge, use the tweezers to gently pull the jewelry out of the piercing. Once the jewelry is out, you can use the pliers to unscrew the jewelry.</p>
