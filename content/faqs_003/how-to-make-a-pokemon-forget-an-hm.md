<p>HMs, or Hidden Machines, are special types of moves that are used to progress in certain areas of the game. They are not like regular moves, as they are not forgotten when your Pokemon levels up. They stay with your Pokemon forever unless you use a special move to make your Pokemon forget them. This article will teach you how to make a Pokemon forget an HM.</p>

<h2>What Are HMs?</h2>

Each HM can only be used once by a single Pokemon, so it’s important to manage your HMs carefully.</p>

<h2>How to Make a Pokemon Forget an HM</h2>
