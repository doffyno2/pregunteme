Civilization 6 (or Civ 6) is a turn-based strategy game where players build an empire by expanding their cities, researching new technologies, and negotiating with other civilizations. Although the game has been out for a few years now, it remains one of the most popular strategy games on the market. One of the most popular and powerful new features of Civ 6 are the Apostles, powerful missionaries and inquisitors who can spread their religious faith around the world and even repair damaged buildings.

<h2>What Are Apostles in Civ 6?</h2>

Apostles are special characters in Civ 6 who can spread their religious faith to other civilizations. They can also repair damaged buildings and restore them to their former glory. Apostles are unlocked when a civilization reaches the Classical Era, and they become stronger and more effective as the game progresses.

<h2>How Do Apostles Work in Civ 6?</h2>

Apostles in Civ 6 are powerful characters who can spread their religious faith to other civilizations. When an Apostle is sent to a city, their religious faith will spread to that city and its citizens. If the city is already following a different religion, the Apostle can attempt to convert the citizens to their own faith.

Apostles can also be used to repair damaged buildings. When an Apostle is sent to a city with damaged buildings, they will attempt to repair them. This can be useful for restoring damaged Wonders and other important buildings, or for quickly rebuilding after a war.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Using Apostles in Civ 6?</h2>

Apostles are one of the most powerful tools available in Civ 6. They can be used to quickly spread a religion to other civilizations, or to repair damaged buildings. This can help a civilization quickly expand its influence and gain a foothold in other parts of the world.

<h2>Are There Any Downsides to Using Apostles in Civ 6?</h2>

The main downside to using Apostles in Civ 6 is that they are relatively expensive to produce. They also require a significant amount of Faith to maintain, which can be difficult to come by in later stages of the game.

In addition, Apostles can only be used to spread a civilization's own religion, so they cannot be used to convert other civilizations to a different faith.

<h2>How to Unlock Apostles in Civ 6?</h2>

Apostles are unlocked when a civilization reaches the Classical Era. Once unlocked, they can be recruited in the same way as other Great People. It is important to note that the cost of recruiting an Apostle increases with each one recruited, so it is important to plan ahead and recruit the right number of Apostles for a particular task.

<h2>How to Use Apostles Effectively in Civ 6?</h2>

Apostles are most effective when used to spread a civilization's own religion. This can be done by sending the Apostle to cities where the religion is not yet established, or to cities where it is already present but needs to be reinforced.
