Peloton is a revolutionary stationary bike that offers a range of options to suit everyone’s needs. It’s a great way to get fit and have fun at the same time. But if you’ve recently purchased or acquired a Peloton, how can you tell what generation it is?

<h2>What is a Peloton?</h2>

Peloton is a stationary bike that is equipped with a touchscreen tablet that allows you to take part in live and pre-recorded classes. The classes are taught by real instructors who provide motivation and guidance. The bike is also equipped with a resistance knob that allows you to adjust the intensity of your workout, as well as a cadence tracker so you can track your progress. 

<h2>How to Identify Your Peloton Generation</h2>

The easiest way to tell what generation Peloton you have is to look at the serial number. The serial number is located on the back of the bike and is typically on a white sticker. It should start with either PN or PEL, followed by several numbers.

The first two numbers of the serial number will tell you the generation of your Peloton. For example, if the serial number starts with PN01, then it is a first-generation bike. If the serial number starts with PN02, then it is a second-generation bike, and so on.

<h2>Differences Between the Generations</h2>

Each generation of Peloton brings with it new features and improvements. The first generation of Peloton was released in 2014 and was equipped with a 22-inch touchscreen. It also had a Bluetooth connection for pairing with headphones.

The second generation of Peloton was released in 2016 and featured a larger 24-inch touchscreen, as well as improved Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. It also featured an integrated heart rate monitor and an improved resistance knob.

The third generation of Peloton was released in 2018 and featured even more improvements. These included a larger 27-inch touchscreen, improved sound system, more resistance levels, and an automatic resistance knob.
