<p>A shotgun is a versatile and powerful weapon, capable of delivering a wide variety of ammunition to a target. Depending on the type of shotgun and the model, the maximum amount of shells a shotgun can hold can range from just a few to several dozen. If youâ€™re curious about this weapon and its capacity, read on to learn more about the amount of shells a shotgun can hold.</p>

<h2>What is a Shotgun?</h2>

<p>A shotgun is a firearm which is designed to fire a variety of ammunition, including slugs, pellets, and birdshot. The ammunition is typically loaded into a magazine tube or a box magazine, and the barrel is rifled so that the ammunition will spin as it leaves the gun. This spin creates a pattern of shot that can be widened to hit multiple targets.</p>

<h2>Types of Shotguns and Capacity</h2>

<p>There are a variety of different types of shotguns, each with their own unique capacity. Pump-action shotguns, which are the most common, hold between five and nine shells in the magazine tube. Semi-automatic shotguns typically hold between five and seven shells in the magazine tube, and the capacity can be increased with an extended magazine. Break-action shotguns have a capacity of two to three shells, and single-shot shotguns have a capacity of one shell. The exact capacity of any given shotgun is determined by the length of the magazine tube or box magazine.</p>

<h2>Extended Magazines and Tube Extensions</h2>

<p>In some cases, it is possible to increase the capacity of a shotgun by using an extended magazine or tube extension. An extended magazine is an aftermarket magazine that has a longer capacity than the standard magazine, allowing it to hold more shells. A tube extension is a piece of metal or plastic that is attached to the magazine tube, allowing it to hold more shells. While these modifications are legal in most states, they can be difficult to obtain and must be installed by a qualified gunsmith.</p>

<h2>Shotgun Shells</h2>

<p>The term shotgun shells refers to the ammunition used in shotguns. Shotgun shells are typically composed of a brass casing, a plastic wad, gunpowder, and a lead or steel projectile. Different types of shells are available, including birdshot, buckshot, slugs, and sabot rounds. The capacity of a shotgun is determined by the size of the shells used. Larger shells, such as those used for slugs, will reduce the capacity of the magazine tube.</p>

<h2>Shotgun Capacity and Law</h2>

<p>In some states, there are laws that limit the capacity of shotguns. In California, for example, the maximum capacity for a shotgun is 10 rounds. Other states may have different restrictions, so it is important to check with your local laws before attempting to increase the capacity of your shotgun. It is also important to note that some states prohibit the use of extended magazines or tube extensions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The amount of shells a shotgun can hold depends on the type of shotgun and the size of the shells used. Pump-action shotguns typically have a capacity of between five and nine shells, semi-automatic shotguns can hold between five and seven shells, break-action shotguns typically have a capacity of two to three shells, and single-shot shotguns have a capacity of one shell. It is possible to increase the capacity of a shotgun by using an extended magazine or tube extension, however these modifications are prohibited in some states. Before attempting to modify a shotgun, it is important to check with your local laws.</p>
