<p>Most people don’t realize how important it is to stay hydrated—not just for your physical health, but also for your mental health.

<p>You can also get creative with your water intake by adding a few slices of lemon or cucumber, or some mint leaves. Adding a bit of flavor can make it more enjoyable to drink and help you reach your goal. And if you don’t like the taste of plain water, there are plenty of other beverages that can help you stay hydrated, such as tea, juice, and smoothies.</p>
