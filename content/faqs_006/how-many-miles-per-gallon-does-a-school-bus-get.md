<p>School buses are a vital part of the transportation system in many countries. They transport students and staff to and from school and sporting events, field trips and other activities. But how many miles per gallon does a school bus get? The answer varies depending on the type of bus and the kind of engine it has.</p>

<h2>The Different Types of School Buses</h2>

<p>Most school buses are powered by diesel fuel, but there are also buses that run on gasoline and electric. Diesel buses are the most common type, as they are more efficient and can carry more passengers. Diesel buses usually get between 7 and 10 miles per gallon. Gasoline buses are less efficient, with an average of 5 to 8 mpg. Electric buses, on the other hand, are more efficient, with an average of 16 to 20 mpg.</p>

<h2>The Different Engines</h2>

<p>The type of engine used in a school bus also affects the miles per gallon. Buses can be powered by either a traditional diesel engine or a more modern turbocharged diesel engine. Traditional diesel engines usually get between 7 and 10 mpg, while turbocharged diesel engines can get up to 12 mpg. Gasoline engines usually get between 5 and 8 mpg, while electric engines get between 16 and 20 mpg.</p>

<h2>The Weight of the Bus</h2>

<p>The weight of the school bus also affects its fuel efficiency. Heavier buses require more fuel to operate and will get fewer miles per gallon than lighter buses. This is why larger buses typically get fewer miles per gallon than smaller buses.</p>

<h2>The Age of the Bus</h2>

<p>Older buses tend to be less efficient than newer buses, as they may have outdated engines or be in need of repairs. Newer buses can be more efficient, as they are often equipped with newer engines and have been maintained regularly.</p>

<h2>Other Factors</h2>

<p>There are other factors that can affect a school bus’s fuel efficiency, such as the terrain it is driving on, the weather conditions, and the number of passengers it is carrying. The type of fuel used can also affect the fuel efficiency of a bus. For example, biodiesel can be more efficient than regular diesel.</p>
