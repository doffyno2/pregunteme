<p>Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria. It is one of the most common STIs in the world, and it can have serious consequences if left untreated. In some cases, the infection may lead to infertility in women. While most people associate chlamydia with symptoms such as pain, burning, or itching in the genital area, some may be surprised to learn that chlamydia can also smell like fish.</p>

<h2>What Is Chlamydia?</h2>

<p>Chlamydia is a bacterial infection caused by the Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria. It is usually spread through sexual contact, and it can affect both men and women. The infection can occur in the genitals, rectum, throat, and eyes. In most cases, it is asymptomatic, meaning people may not experience any symptoms. However, when symptoms do occur, they may include pain while urinating, discharge, itching, and burning in the genital area.</p>

<h2>Can Chlamydia Smell Like Fish?</h2>

<p>In some cases, chlamydia can cause a strong, fishy smell in the genital area. This is typically caused by an infection in the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. The smell is usually caused by an accumulation of bacteria and discharge in the urethra that has a fishy smell. This is most common in women, but it can also occur in men.</p>

<h2>What Other Symptoms Are Associated With Chlamydia?</h2>

<p>In addition to a fishy smell, other symptoms of chlamydia may include pain during urination, itching and burning in the genital area, and an abnormal discharge. In women, the infection may also cause lower abdominal pain, bleeding between periods, and pain during intercourse. In men, the infection may cause pain in the testicles and a burning sensation in the urethra. If left untreated, chlamydia can lead to serious complications, including infertility in women.</p>

If the infection is not treated correctly, it can lead to serious complications.</p>
