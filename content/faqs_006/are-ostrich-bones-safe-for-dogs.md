Are Ostrich Bones Safe For Dogs?

When it comes to our beloved furry friends, it’s important to make sure that they are safe and healthy. This includes being aware of any potential risks that may come with the toys and treats they are given. Ostrich bones are a popular treat for dogs, but you may be wondering if they are actually safe or not.

In this article, we will discuss the safety of ostrich bones for dogs, as well as the potential health benefits they can provide. We will also cover some tips on how to keep your pup safe when feeding them any type of bone. 

Are Ostrich Bones Safe For Dogs?

The short answer is yes, ostrich bones are considered safe for dogs. Ostrich bones are much softer and more pliable than other bones, such as beef, pork, or lamb bones. This makes them a much safer option for dogs to chew on, as they will not splinter and pose a choking hazard. 

However, it is important to note that bones of any kind can pose a risk of ingestion, and should be given to your pup with supervision. If a dog swallows a large piece of bone, it could cause an intestinal obstruction, which can be dangerous and may require medical intervention. 

It is also important to keep in mind that ostrich bones are quite hard, so they do not break down easily. This means that they can last a long time, which can be both good and bad. On the one hand, it means that your pup can enjoy the treat for longer. On the other hand, it means that the bone could potentially get stuck in the throat or stomach if it is swallowed. 

Health Benefits of Ostrich Bones

In addition to being a safe treat, ostrich bones can also provide your pup with some health benefits. Ostrich bones are rich in calcium and phosphorus, which are important minerals for bone health. They also contain iron, zinc, magnesium, and potassium, which can help promote a healthy immune system. 

Ostrich bones also contain glucosamine, chondroitin, and collagen, which are all important components of healthy joints and cartilage. These compounds can help reduce inflammation and pain in the joints, which is especially important for older dogs. 

Finally, the act of chewing can help reduce stress and anxiety in dogs. Chewing on bones helps to clean the teeth and remove plaque, while also providing mental stimulation. Chewing can also help to divert a dog’s attention away from negative behaviors. 

Tips For Feeding Ostrich Bones To Dogs

When feeding your pup ostrich bones, it’s important to keep a few safety tips in mind. Here are some tips to keep your pup safe when feeding them ostrich bones:

• Always supervise your pup when they are chewing on an ostrich bone.

• Make sure the bone is the appropriate size for your pup. A bone that is too big can pose a choking hazard.

• If a piece of bone gets stuck in your pup’s throat, do not attempt to remove it. Call your veterinarian immediately. 

• Discard any uneaten pieces of bone after a few days. 

• Do not feed cooked ostrich bones to your pup, as they can splinter and cause injury.
