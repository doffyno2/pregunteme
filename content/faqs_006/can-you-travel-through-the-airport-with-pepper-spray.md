From the initial security screening to the long lines and crowded terminals, it can be difficult to stay calm and collected while trying to make your way to your destination. To make matters worse, many travelers are not aware of the regulations regarding items that can and cannot be taken through the airport. One of the items that can cause confusion is pepper spray. 

<h2>What is Pepper Spray?</h2>

It is made from a combination of chemicals and capsaicin, a substance derived from chili peppers that is used to irritate the eyes and skin of an assailant. While pepper spray is legal in many places, it is regulated in some states and countries, so it is important to check the regulations where you are traveling. 

<h2>Can You Travel With Pepper Spray?</h2>

The container must also have a safety mechanism to prevent accidental discharge.
