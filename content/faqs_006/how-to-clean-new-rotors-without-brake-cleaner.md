<p>Rotors are an integral part of any car's braking system. Not only do they help your car stop on a dime, but they also have to be kept in good working order. Unfortunately, when it comes to cleaning rotors, many people rely on brake cleaner, which can be harmful to the environment, and it can also be dangerous to use. But, don't worry; there are ways to clean rotors without brake cleaner, and it doesn't have to be a difficult process.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>Cleaning rotors without brake cleaner will require a few items. You'll need a soft cloth, a brush that can be used on the rotor, some mild soap, water, and a soft towel or rag. You'll also need a flashlight, so you can clearly see the rotor and make sure you're not missing any spots.</p>

<h2>Step One: Preparing The Rotor</h2>

<p>The first step in cleaning your rotors is to remove any dirt or debris that may have accumulated on them. Use the flashlight to inspect the rotor and look for any dirt, grime, or rust. Make sure that you're thorough in your inspection; you don't want to miss any spots. Once you've identified the areas that need to be cleaned, use the brush to gently scrub away any debris. Be careful not to be too aggressive; you don't want to damage the rotor.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Applying The Soap</h2>

<p>Once you've removed all the debris from the rotor, it's time to apply the soap. Use the soft cloth to apply a generous amount of mild soap to the rotor. Make sure that the soap is evenly distributed and that all of the rotor is covered. Once the soap has been applied, use the cloth to scrub the rotor in a circular motion. Make sure that you're being gentle and that you're not scrubbing too hard. You don't want to damage the rotor.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Rinsing The Rotor</h2>

<p>Once you're done scrubbing the rotor with soap, it's time to rinse it off. Use a garden hose or a bucket of water to rinse off the soap. Make sure that you're rinsing off all of the soap and that no soap residue is left behind. Once you've rinsed off the soap, use the soft towel or rag to dry off the rotor. Be sure to dry the rotor thoroughly; any residual moisture can cause rust and corrosion on the rotor.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Inspecting The Rotor</h2>

<p>Once you've finished cleaning the rotor, it's time to inspect it. Use the flashlight to inspect the rotor and make sure that it's clean and free of any dirt, grime, or rust. If you find any areas that need to be cleaned, repeat the process until the rotor is completely clean.</p>
