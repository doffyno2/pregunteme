Tuna fishing is a lucrative business. It is estimated that the global tuna industry is worth billions of dollars and continues to grow each year. With such a large market, it is no wonder that many people are considering investing in a tuna fishing boat. But how much does a tuna fishing boat cost?

The cost of a tuna fishing boat varies depending on the size, model, and features. Generally, the cost of a tuna fishing boat ranges from $200,000 to $3 million. This price range can be broken down further into three main categories: small tuna fishing boats, mid-sized tuna fishing boats, and large tuna fishing boats.
