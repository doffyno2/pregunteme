Do I Need a Fishing License to Crab in Texas?

Crabbing is a popular fishing activity in Texas, as it offers plenty of opportunities for people to enjoy the outdoors while still catching some delicious seafood. But before you can get started, it is important to know if you need a fishing license to crab in Texas. In this article, we will discuss the regulations and requirements for crabbing in Texas, as well as the types of licenses available.

What Are the Regulations for Crabbing in Texas?

In Texas, recreational fishing for crabs is regulated by the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department (TPWD). The TPWD requires that anyone over the age of 17 must obtain a valid fishing license before engaging in crabbing. There are two types of licenses available: a resident license and a non-resident license. 

Resident Fishing License

A resident license allows any resident of Texas who is 17 years or older to fish for crabs in the state. A resident license is valid for one year from the date of purchase and must be renewed annually.

Non-Resident Fishing License

A non-resident license is available to any non-resident who is 17 years or older and wants to fish for crabs in the state. This license is valid for one year from the date of purchase and must be renewed annually. 

Types of Fishing Licenses

In addition to the two main types of fishing licenses, there are also several other types of licenses that may be required for crabbing in Texas. These include a "catch and release" license, which allows the holder to catch and release crabs without taking them home; a "guide" license, which allows the holder to guide others while fishing; and a "charter" license, which allows the holder to operate a charter boat for recreational fishing. 

What Are the Costs of a Fishing License?

The cost of a fishing license varies depending on the type of license and the length of time for which it is valid. Resident licenses cost $30 for one year and $58 for two years. Non-resident licenses cost $68 for one year and $126 for two years. "Catch and release" licenses cost $10 for one year and $18 for two years.
