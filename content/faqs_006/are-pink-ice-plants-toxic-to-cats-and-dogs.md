Are Pink Ice Plants Toxic to Cats and Dogs?



Pink ice plants are a type of succulent that can be grown in many different climates. They are drought tolerant plants that thrive in bright, indirect sunlight. While these plants can make a great addition to any home, it is important to know if they are toxic to cats and dogs before bringing them into your home. 

<h2>What are Pink Ice Plants?</h2>

Pink ice plants (Delosperma cooperi) are a species of succulent native to South Africa. These plants have thick, fleshy leaves in shades of green, yellow, and pink that are covered in small hairs to help them retain moisture.

<h2>Are Pink Ice Plants Toxic? </h2>

Pink ice plants are considered to be non-toxic to both cats and dogs. The ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) lists pink ice plants as being non-toxic to both cats and dogs.

<h2>How to Keep Your Pet Safe </h2>

Even though pink ice plants are not toxic, it is still important to take precautions to keep your pet safe. Whenever introducing a new plant into the home, it is best to keep it in an area that is out of reach of both cats and dogs. This can help to prevent accidental ingestion and keep your pet safe.
