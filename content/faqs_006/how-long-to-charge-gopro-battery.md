<p>GoPro cameras are one of the most popular action cameras in the world today. They are used by professionals and hobbyists alike, and they offer a great deal of functionality. But like any other device, they require an external power source to function properly. That's why it's important to understand how long to charge a GoPro battery before you head out on your next adventure.</p>

<p>When it comes to charging a GoPro battery, there are a few things to consider. The first is the type of battery you are using. The original GoPro HERO cameras use lithium-ion batteries, while the newer HERO5 and HERO6 models use lithium-polymer batteries. The newer batteries are more efficient and can hold a charge for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>The other factor to consider is the battery capacity. GoPro batteries come in different sizes, ranging from 1100mAh to 4700mAh. The higher the capacity, the longer it will take to charge. The higher the capacity, the longer you can use your camera without having to recharge.</p>
