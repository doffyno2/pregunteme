<p>Helium tanks are often used to fill balloons with helium for special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and other celebrations. But how many balloons can a helium tank blow up? The answer depends on the size of the tank and the size of the balloons.</p>

<h2>What Size Helium Tank Should I Use?</h2>

<p>The size of the helium tank you should use depends on the type and size of the balloons you are filling. Generally, a tank that holds up to 125 cubic feet of helium will be able to fill approximately 50 to 100 11-inch balloons. If you are filling larger balloons (such as 18-inch balloons), then you will need a tank that holds up to 350 cubic feet of helium in order to fill the same amount.</p>

<h2>How Many Balloons Can You Blow Up With a Helium Tank?</h2>
