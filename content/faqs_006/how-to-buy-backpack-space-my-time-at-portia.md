<h2>Types of Backpacks</h2>

Before you purchase a backpack, you should consider the type of backpack that is right for your needs. There are three main types of backpacks: daypacks, weekenders, and extended-stay backpacks.

Weekenders are designed for longer trips. They are larger than daypacks, with more compartments and straps. They are designed to carry more gear and provisions, including food, clothing, and camping supplies.
