<h2>Treating Dog Prolapse at Home</h2>

<p>If your dog is suffering from prolapse, it is important that you take him to the vet immediately. However, there are some things that you can do at home to help ease his discomfort. The most important thing is to keep the area clean. This can be done by gently cleaning the area with a mild soap and warm water. It is also important to keep the area dry and free of moisture. To do this, you can use a soft cloth or cotton ball dipped in witch hazel.</p>

<p>You should also keep your dog on a soft, comfortable surface. This can be a towel, blanket, or even a pet bed. This will help keep pressure off of the area and make your dog more comfortable. Additionally, you should restrict your dog's activity to short walks and avoid any type of strenuous exercise. This will help reduce any strain on the area and help it to heal.</p>
