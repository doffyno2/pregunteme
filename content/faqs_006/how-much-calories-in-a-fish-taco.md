Fish tacos are a popular and delicious meal, but do you know exactly how many calories you are consuming when you indulge in this delicacy? The answer may surprise you. 

<h2>Nutritional Facts About Fish Tacos</h2>

A typical fish taco contains between 200 and 250 calories. This is based on the type of fish used and the amount of fish in the taco. If you are using a leaner cut of fish, such as cod or tilapia, the calorie count may be slightly lower than if you were using a fattier fish, such as salmon or tuna. If you are using a grilled fish, the calorie count is likely to increase due to the added oil and fat used for cooking. 

The calories in a fish taco also depend on the type of ingredients used to make the taco. If you are using a flour tortilla, the calories in the taco will be slightly higher than if you are using a corn tortilla. In addition, if you are using other ingredients, such as cheese, sour cream, or salsa, the calorie count will be higher.
