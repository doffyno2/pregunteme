<p>Flushing antifreeze from a camper is an important maintenance task that ensures your camper is running properly and prevents it from freezing in cold temperatures. The process of flushing antifreeze from your camper is not complicated, but it is important to follow the right steps so that you can be sure you have done the job correctly. This article will explain the process of flushing antifreeze from a camper, including the necessary tools, supplies, and steps.</p>

<h2>Tools and Supplies Needed</h2>

<p>The first step in flushing antifreeze from a camper is to gather the necessary tools and supplies. You will need a bucket, a garden hose, a funnel, a pair of gloves, antifreeze, and a couple of rags. Make sure you have all of these items on hand before beginning the flushing process.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Once you have gathered all the necessary supplies, it is time to begin the process of flushing antifreeze from your camper. The steps are as follows:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Drain the Existing Antifreeze</h3>

<p>Start by draining the existing antifreeze from your camper. To do this, locate the antifreeze drain plug on the side of the camper and remove it. Place the bucket underneath the drain plug and allow the antifreeze to drain completely. Once the antifreeze has drained, replace the drain plug and move on to the next step.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Fill the Camper with Water</h3>

<p>Next, fill the camper with water. Using the garden hose, fill the camper with fresh water until it is full. Make sure to use the funnel to avoid spilling water on the ground.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Drain the Water</h3>

<p>Once the camper is full of water, it is time to drain it. Begin by removing the drain plug again and placing the bucket underneath it. Allow the water to drain completely. Once the water has drained, replace the drain plug and move on to the next step.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Refill the Camper with Water</h3>

<p>Repeat steps two and three until the water that is being drained from the camper is free of antifreeze. After draining the water, refill the camper with fresh water and repeat the process until the water that is being drained is free of antifreeze.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add Antifreeze</h3>

<p>Once the water is free of antifreeze, it is time to add new antifreeze. Begin by filling the camper with fresh water and then adding the antifreeze. Make sure to use the funnel to avoid spilling the antifreeze on the ground. Once you have added the antifreeze, drain the water and antifreeze mixture from the camper. Repeat this step until the water that is being drained is free of antifreeze.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Dispose of the Antifreeze</h3>

<p>Once the flushing process is complete, it is important to dispose of the antifreeze properly. You can do this by taking the antifreeze to a recycling center or by pouring it into a container and then disposing of it in an appropriate manner.</p>
