<p>GoPros are incredibly popular action cameras that are used by people all around the world. Whether you are an extreme sports enthusiast, an outdoor adventurer, or just someone who loves to capture all of your fun moments, a GoPro can help you out. But one of the most common questions people have about GoPros is how many hours can they record?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the type of GoPro you have. For example, the HERO8 Black can record up to 4K resolution video at 60 frames per second (fps) for up to 1 hour and 45 minutes. The HERO7 Black can record up to 4K resolution video at 30 frames per second (fps) for up to 2 hours and 15 minutes. The HERO6 Black can record up to 4K resolution video at 30 frames per second (fps) for up to 2 hours and 30 minutes. Lastly, the HERO5 Black can record up to 4K resolution video at 30 frames per second (fps) for up to 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p>

<h2>How to Maximize Recording Time on Your GoPro</h2>

<p>If you are looking to maximize the recording time on your GoPro, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure you are using the highest quality video settings that your GoPro can handle. Higher quality video takes up more storage space, so it is important to find the right balance between quality and storage space.</p>

<p>Second, use a larger storage card. Most GoPros come with a microSD card, but you can upgrade this to a larger capacity. Higher capacity cards will give you more storage space, meaning you can record more video.</p>

<p>Third, delete any videos or photos you no longer need. This will free up storage space, allowing you to record more video.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure your GoPro is fully charged before you start recording. A fully charged GoPro can record for longer than one that is not fully charged.</p>
