<p>The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is an iconic structure that spans the Narrows, the body of water separating Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City. The bridge is an impressive feat of engineering and an important part of the city's infrastructure, connecting the two boroughs and allowing for easy travel between the two. But how long is the bridge?</p>

<p>The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is one of the longest suspension bridges in the world. It is 4,260 feet long, or just over two and a half miles, from shore to shore. The bridge is made up of two towers, each 693 feet tall, connected by a single span of steel cables. The roadway is 160 feet wide and carries 12 lanes of traffic. The total weight of the bridge is over 100,000 tons.</p>

<p>The bridge was opened in 1964, after four years of construction. The project was a joint effort between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, with funding provided by the federal government. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its completion, a record that it held until 1981 when the Humber Bridge in England was completed.</p>

<p>In addition to its impressive size and length, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge also features some unique design elements. It is the first suspension bridge to use a hybrid cable system, combining steel cables and high-strength steel rods. The bridge also features a distinctive arch design, which helps to reduce the amount of steel needed for its construction. The bridge is also noted for its two sets of suspender cables, which run from the bridge deck to the main cables and help to support it.</p>
