<p>The world population is estimated to be 7.8 billion people and counting. With so many people, itâ€™s no surprise that there are an estimated number of houses in the world as well. But what is the exact number of houses in the world? And why is it so difficult to determine an exact number?</p>

<p>In order to answer these questions, we must first understand the definition of a house. A house is defined as a building in which people live, typically consisting of a single family, but sometimes with multiple families living together. Houses can be permanent or temporary, and can come in many different shapes and sizes. For example, a house could be a tent, a single-family home, a duplex, an apartment building, a villa, a townhome, or even a mobile home.</p>

<p>In addition to understanding the definition of a house, it is important to understand the different types of housing that exist in the world. These include public housing, government subsidized housing, private housing, and informal housing. Public housing is owned and operated by the government and is typically available to low-income families. Government subsidized housing is a type of housing that is offered at a low cost to those who are eligible. Private housing is typically owned by individuals or companies and is not subsidized by the government. Informal housing is any type of housing that is not regulated by the government and is typically characterized by low-cost and informal living arrangements.</p>

This includes all types of housing, from informal dwellings to permanent homes. This number does not include people who are living in shelters or other temporary housing.</p>
