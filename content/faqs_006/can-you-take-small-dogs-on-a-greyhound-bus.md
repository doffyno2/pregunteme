<p>Greyhound buses are a great way to travel but many people don’t realize that they also allow small pets on board as well. Small dogs can be a great companion on a long road trip and Greyhound buses are a great way to take them with you. But before you decide to take Fido along on your next Greyhound adventure, there are a few things you need to know.</p>

<h2>What Are the Rules For Taking Dogs On Greyhound Buses?</h2>

<p>Greyhound buses allow small dogs on board as long as they are contained in a secure carrier. The carrier must be able to fit comfortably under the seat in front of you and should be able to be securely closed. The carrier should also have adequate ventilation and should be large enough for your pet to stand up, turn around and lie down in. Greyhound also requires that your pet be vaccinated and have all their paperwork up to date. They also require that your pet be housebroken and not display any aggressive behavior.</p>

<p>Greyhound also requires that you purchase a special ticket for your pet. This ticket is only available at the ticket counter and not online. The cost of the ticket is usually around $25 and is non-refundable. You will also have to pay an additional fee for any extra legroom that you require for your pet. If you have a large dog, you may be asked to pay for an additional seat. This will depend on the size of the dog and the size of the seat.</p>
