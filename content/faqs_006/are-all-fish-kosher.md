Are All Fish Kosher?

When it comes to keeping kosher, the question of whether or not fish is kosher is a frequent one. It turns out that not all fish are kosher, and understanding which ones are and which ones aren’t can be a bit of a challenge. In this article, we’ll be looking at the basics of kosher fish, so that you can make sure you’re eating the right kind of fish. 



Kosher fish are fish that meet the requirements of Jewish dietary laws, which are known as kashrut. These laws are based on ancient biblical and rabbinic writings, and they set out specific rules for which types of food can be eaten and which types cannot. 

When it comes to fish, the main rule is that the fish must have both fins and scales. This means that some of the most popular types of fish, such as catfish, eel, and sturgeon, are not considered to be kosher. On the other hand, salmon, trout, and tuna are all considered to be kosher.



Eating kosher fish has a number of benefits. For starters, it ensures that the fish you’re eating is of the highest quality. By following the rules of kashrut, you can be sure that the fish you’re eating is fresh and free of any contaminants or additives. 

In addition, eating kosher fish is also a great way to ensure that you’re getting a healthy and balanced diet. The fish that are considered to be kosher are typically high in essential vitamins and minerals, and they can also provide your body with a good source of protein. 

Finally, eating kosher fish is also a great way to ensure that you’re supporting the environment. By eating only those fish that are considered to be kosher, you can help to ensure that fish populations remain healthy and sustainable.



The easiest way to tell if a fish is kosher is to look for the presence of scales and fins. All fish that are considered to be kosher must have both of these features. 

If a fish does not have scales, then it is not considered to be kosher. Similarly, if a fish does not have fins, then it is also not considered to be kosher. 

You can also check the label of any fish you purchase to determine if it is considered to be kosher. Most fish that are considered to be kosher will have a label that states this, so this is a good way to ensure that you’re only eating the right type of fish.



Shellfish, such as oysters, clams, mussels, and crabs, are not considered to be kosher. This is because they do not have both fins and scales. 

Shellfish can also be difficult to prepare in a way that meets the requirements of kashrut. For this reason, they are typically not consumed by those who keep kosher. 



In conclusion, not all fish are considered to be kosher. In order for a fish to be considered to be kosher, it must have both fins and scales. Fish that do not have both of these features are not considered to be kosher. In addition, shellfish are also not considered to be kosher. 

By understanding the basics of kosher fish, you can make sure that you’re eating the right kind of fish, and that you’re getting the most out of your meals.
