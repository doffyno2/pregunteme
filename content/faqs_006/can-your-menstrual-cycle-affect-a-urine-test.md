<p>A urine test is a common procedure used for diagnosing and monitoring various medical conditions. The test is used to detect a wide range of substances in the body, from hormones and proteins to glucose and illicit drugs. Urine tests are also used to monitor the progress of a health condition. But can the menstrual cycle affect the results of a urine test?</p>

<p>The answer is yes. Depending on the time of month, your menstrual cycle can affect the results of a urine test. This is because the hormones that govern your menstrual cycle will influence the levels of other hormones in your body. This means that, when you are menstruating, your hormone levels will be different than when you are not.</p>

<p>For example, during ovulation, your body produces higher levels of estrogen and luteinizing hormone (LH). These hormones can influence the levels of other hormones, such as testosterone and cortisol, which are often tested in urine tests. As a result, the levels of these hormones measured in the urine sample will be different than when you are not ovulating.</p>

<p>In addition, the menstrual cycle can also affect the levels of proteins, glucose, and other substances found in the urine. During menstruation, the levels of these substances can be higher or lower than normal. This can affect the results of a urine test and make it difficult to accurately diagnose or monitor a health condition.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the menstrual cycle does not always affect the results of a urine test. In some cases, the levels of hormones, proteins, and other substances in the urine can remain stable throughout the menstrual cycle. However, it is always best to inform your doctor or health care provider if you are menstruating when you are scheduled for a urine test.</p>
