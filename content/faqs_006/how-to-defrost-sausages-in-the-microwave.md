<p>Sausages are an incredibly versatile type of food. They can be grilled, boiled, fried, or even microwaved! Defrosting sausages in the microwave is a fast and easy way to prepare them for cooking. It’s important to remember, however, that you should always cook sausages thoroughly after defrosting them in the microwave. With some patience and a few simple steps, you can defrost your sausages in the microwave in no time.</p>

<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>

<p>To defrost sausages in the microwave, you’ll need the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A microwave-safe plate or container</li>
  <li>Paper towels</li>
  <li>A microwave</li>
  <li>The sausages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Defrosting Sausages in the Microwave</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Place the Sausages on a Plate or in a Container</h3>

<p>Place the sausages on a microwave-safe plate or in a container. If using a plate, cover the sausages with a few layers of paper towels. This will help absorb any excess moisture as the sausages defrost.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Set the Microwave Power Level</h3>

<p>Set the microwave power level to 50 percent. If your microwave does not have a variable power level, set it to medium or medium-high power.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Defrost the Sausages</h3>

<p>Place the plate or container in the microwave and set the timer for two minutes. After two minutes, check the sausages to see if they have defrosted. If not, continue microwaving the sausages in one-minute increments until they are fully defrosted.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Cook the Sausages Immediately</h3>

<p>Once the sausages are fully defrosted, they should be cooked immediately. Do not leave them at room temperature for more than two hours, as this could cause food-borne illness. Cook the sausages according to the instructions on the package.</p>
