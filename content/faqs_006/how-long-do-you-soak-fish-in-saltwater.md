<p>If you’re planning to cook fish, you may want to consider soaking it in saltwater first. This is a common practice that helps to remove any impurities and draw out any unwanted flavors from the fish. But how long should you soak fish in saltwater?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the type of fish you’re using and the size of the pieces. Generally speaking, small pieces of fish should be soaked for about 10 minutes, while larger pieces can be soaked for up to 1 hour. If you’re using a whole fish, it should be soaked for at least 2 hours. For optimal results, it’s best to soak fish in cold water and make sure to change the water every 30 minutes or so.</p>

<p>Soaking fish in saltwater is beneficial because it helps to remove any impurities, draw out any unwanted flavors, and tenderize the fish. It also helps to reduce the fishy smell and improve the flavor. The saltwater solution also helps to keep the fish from sticking to the pan when it’s cooked.</p>

<p>When you’re soaking fish in saltwater, it’s important to use a good quality salt. You should always use a fine-grain sea salt, and avoid table salt or any other type of salt that has added preservatives or chemicals. The amount of salt you use will depend on the size of the fish and the size of the pieces you’re soaking. Generally speaking, you should use about 1 tablespoon of salt for every cup of water.</p>

<p>When you’re finished soaking the fish, it’s important to drain the saltwater solution and rinse the fish with cold running water. This will help to remove any remaining impurities and help to reduce the saltiness of the fish. It’s also important to make sure that the fish is completely dry before cooking it.</p>
