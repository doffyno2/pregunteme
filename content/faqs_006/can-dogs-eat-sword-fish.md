<p>Swordfish is a large, predatory fish that lives in the open ocean, and it is a popular food choice for humans around the world. But, can dogs eat swordfish safely? The answer is generally no, but there are a few exceptions to this rule.</p>

<h2>Are Any Parts of Swordfish Safe for Dogs to Eat?</h2>
