Adderall is a prescription medication that is used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in humans. It is also commonly used to treat narcolepsy, a sleep disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. While Adderall is approved for use in humans, it is not approved for use in pets. Nevertheless, Adderall is sometimes prescribed off-label for dogs with similar conditions, such as hyperactivity or attention issues. It is important to note that Adderall is a stimulant and can cause serious side effects if not used as directed. In this article, we will explore how long Adderall typically lasts in a dog and the potential side effects associated with the drug.

<h2>What is Adderall?</h2>
