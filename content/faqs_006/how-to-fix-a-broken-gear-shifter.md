<p>A broken gear shifter can be a major headache for any car owner. The gear shifter is responsible for shifting the car’s transmission into the various gears, so if it’s not working right, then your car won’t be able to shift properly. This can lead to serious problems and may even require expensive repairs. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to try and fix a broken gear shifter. Read on to learn more.</p>

<h2>Steps to Fix a Broken Gear Shifter</h2>

<p>If you’ve noticed that your car’s gear shifter is not working properly, then you should take the following steps to try and fix it.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Check the Gear Shifter Cable</h3>

<p>The first thing you should do is check the gear shifter cable. This is the cable that runs from the gear shifter to the transmission. If the cable is loose or frayed, then it may be the cause of the problem. To check the cable, you’ll need to remove the shift knob from the shifter and then move the shifter back and forth. If the cable is loose or frayed, then you’ll need to replace it.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Inspect the Gear Shifter Linkage</h3>

<p>The next step is to inspect the gear shifter linkage. This is the linkage that connects the gear shifter to the transmission. If the linkage is loose or worn, then it may be causing the shifter to not work properly. To check the linkage, you’ll need to look under the car and locate the linkage. Inspect it for any signs of wear or damage. If the linkage is damaged, then you’ll need to replace it.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Check the Shift Lever</h3>

<p>The next step is to check the shift lever. This is the lever that moves the shift rod from one gear to the next. If the lever is loose or worn, then it may be causing the shifter to not work properly. To check the lever, you’ll need to locate it under the car and inspect it for any signs of wear or damage. If the lever is damaged, then you’ll need to replace it.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Lubricate the Gear Shifter</h3>

<p>The last step is to lubricate the gear shifter. This will help to reduce friction and make it easier for the shifter to move. To lubricate the shifter, you’ll need to remove it from the car and then apply a lubricant to all of the moving parts. Be sure to wipe off any excess lubricant before re-installing the shifter.</p>
