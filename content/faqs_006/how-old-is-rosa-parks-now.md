<p>Rosa Parks is an iconic figure in American civil rights history and her legacy still resonates today, more than 50 years after her famous protest. One of the most influential African-Americans of the twentieth century, Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. She died on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92.</p>
