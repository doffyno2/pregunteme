<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving technique used to restore circulation and breathing to someone who is in cardiac arrest. It is usually administered by a healthcare professional, but it can also be performed by a bystander with basic training. The American Heart Association recommends that CPR be administered in cycles of 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths. Five cycles of CPR should take approximately 2-2.5 minutes to complete.</p>

<h2>What Is Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)?</h2>

<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency medical procedure used to restore circulation and breathing to someone who is in cardiac arrest. It is usually administered by a healthcare professional, but it can also be performed by a bystander with basic training. It involves chest compressions, which are performed to pump oxygenated blood to the body, followed by rescue breaths, which are used to restore breathing. The American Heart Association recommends that CPR be administered in cycles of 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths.</p>

<h2>What Is the Purpose of CPR?</h2>

<p>The purpose of CPR is to restore circulation and breathing to someone who is in cardiac arrest. It is a life-saving technique, as it can keep the person alive until medical help arrives. CPR also helps stabilize the person's condition until they can be transferred to a hospital for further treatment.</p>

<h2>What Is the Recommended Technique for Administering CPR?</h2>

<p>The American Heart Association recommends that CPR be administered in cycles of 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths. It is important to note that the chest compressions should be performed at a rate of 100-120 per minute and the rescue breaths should be delivered over 1 second. It is also important to ensure that the chest compressions are deep and that the rescue breaths are delivered with enough force to make the chest rise.</p>

<h2>How Long Should Five Cycles of CPR Take?</h2>

<p>Five cycles of CPR should take approximately 2-2.5 minutes to complete. This includes the 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths for each cycle, as well as any pauses that may occur in between cycles. It is important to note that the exact time will vary depending on the rate at which the chest compressions are performed and the depth of the chest compressions.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risks of Administering CPR?</h2>

<p>Administering CPR carries certain risks, including the risk of injuring the person being resuscitated. It is important to remember that chest compressions should be performed at a rate of 100-120 per minute and that the chest compressions should be deep. It is also important to remember to deliver the rescue breaths with enough force to make the chest rise. Additionally, there is a risk of infection from administering CPR, so it is important to use personal protective gear (such as gloves and a face shield) when performing CPR.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do if the Person Being Resuscitated Does Not Respond?</h2>

<p>If the person being resuscitated does not respond, it is important to stop CPR and call for medical help immediately. Do not attempt to perform any additional chest compressions or rescue breaths if the person is not responding. Additionally, it is important to follow any instructions given by the medical personnel when they arrive.</p>
