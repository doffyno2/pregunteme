<p>If you own a Whirlpool refrigerator and you're having trouble with it not defrosting, then it's time to force the defrost cycle. Fortunately, this is a relatively simple process. All you need is a few basic tools and a little bit of knowledge about how Whirlpool refrigerators work. In this article, we'll show you how to force the defrost cycle in a Whirlpool refrigerator.</p>

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

<p>To force the defrost cycle, you'll need a few simple tools. Here's a list of what you'll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A flathead screwdriver</li>
  <li>A Phillips head screwdriver</li>
  <li>A pair of pliers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Locate the Evaporator Fan</h2>

<p>The first step is to locate the evaporator fan. This is the fan that is responsible for circulating the cold air in your refrigerator. To find the fan, you'll need to remove the back panel of the refrigerator. This is done by using a flathead screwdriver to unscrew the panel. Once the panel is removed, you should be able to see the fan.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Disconnect the Fan Motor</h2>

<p>Once you've located the fan motor, the next step is to disconnect it. To do this, you'll need to use the Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the two screws that are securing the fan motor in place. Once the screws are removed, you can carefully disconnect the fan motor from the wiring.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Remove the Fan Motor</h2>

<p>Once the fan motor is disconnected, you can then use a pair of pliers to carefully remove it from the refrigerator. Be sure to be careful when doing this, as the fan motor is delicate and can be easily damaged.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Force the Defrost Cycle</h2>

<p>Once the fan motor has been removed, you can then force the defrost cycle by pressing and holding the defrost button on the control panel. This will cause the refrigerator to enter the defrost cycle and should resolve any issues you were having with the refrigerator not defrosting.</p>
