<p>GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. </p>

<p>GitHub allows developers to collaborate on projects by adding other developers to a repository as collaborators. Collaborators can push, pull, commit, and edit files just like the repository's owner, but only the owner has full control over the repository. </p>
