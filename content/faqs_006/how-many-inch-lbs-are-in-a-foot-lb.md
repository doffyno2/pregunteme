<p>Inch-pounds and foot-pounds are both units of torque, which is a measure of rotational force. When it comes to understanding torque, it is important to know how to convert between the two units. This article will explain how to convert from foot-pounds to inch-pounds and vice versa.</p>

<h2>What Is Torque?</h2>

<p>Torque is a measure of rotational force, which is the force that causes an object to rotate. Torque is measured in units of force multiplied by distance, which are typically expressed in either foot-pounds or inch-pounds. The unit of torque is the same as the unit of work, which is the energy required to move an object a certain distance.</p>

<h2>How To Convert Foot-Pounds To Inch-Pounds</h2>

<p>To convert foot-pounds to inch-pounds, simply multiply the number of foot-pounds by 12. For example, if you have 10 foot-pounds of torque, then you have 120 inch-pounds of torque. The formula for converting foot-pounds to inch-pounds is as follows:</p>

<p><b>Inch-pounds = Foot-pounds x 12</b></p>

<h2>How To Convert Inch-Pounds To Foot-Pounds</h2>

<p>To convert inch-pounds to foot-pounds, simply divide the number of inch-pounds by 12. For example, if you have 120 inch-pounds of torque, then you have 10 foot-pounds of torque. The formula for converting inch-pounds to foot-pounds is as follows:</p>

<p><b>Foot-pounds = Inch-pounds รท 12</b></p>

<h2>What Is A Foot-Pound?</h2>

<p>A foot-pound is a unit of torque or rotational force, which is an expression of the amount of energy required to move an object a certain distance. A foot-pound is equal to the amount of energy required to move one pound of mass a distance of one foot. The symbol for a foot-pound is ft-lb.</p>

<h2>What Is An Inch-Pound?</h2>

<p>An inch-pound is a unit of torque or rotational force, which is an expression of the amount of energy required to move an object a certain distance. An inch-pound is equal to the amount of energy required to move one pound of mass a distance of one inch. The symbol for an inch-pound is in-lb.</p>

<h2>Example Of Converting Foot-Pounds To Inch-Pounds</h2>

<p>For example, let's say you have a wrench that can apply 10 foot-pounds of torque. To find out how many inch-pounds this is, simply multiply 10 foot-pounds by 12, which gives you 120 inch-pounds.</p>

<h2>Example Of Converting Inch-Pounds To Foot-Pounds</h2>

<p>For example, let's say you have a wrench that can apply 120 inch-pounds of torque. To find out how many foot-pounds this is, simply divide 120 inch-pounds by 12, which gives you 10 foot-pounds.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, inch-pounds and foot-pounds are both units of torque or rotational force. To convert from foot-pounds to inch-pounds, simply multiply the number of foot-pounds by 12. To convert from inch-pounds to foot-pounds, divide the number of inch-pounds by 12. Knowing how to convert between the two units is important when it comes to understanding torque.</p>
