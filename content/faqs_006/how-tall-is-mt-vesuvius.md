<p>Mt Vesuvius is one of the most iconic and famous volcanoes in the world. Located in southern Italy, it is the only active volcano on the mainland of Europe, and is known for its violent eruptions. In 79 AD, it famously destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. But how tall is Mt Vesuvius?</p>

<h2>Mt Vesuvius' Height</h2>

<p>Mt Vesuvius stands at an impressive 1,281 meters (4,203 feet). This makes it the tallest mountain in the Campania region of Italy, and the highest peak in the Phlegraen Fields. It is also the second highest mountain in the entire country, behind Mt Etna in Sicily.</p>

<h2>Geology of Mt Vesuvius</h2>

<p>Mt Vesuvius is actually a stratovolcano, which is a type of volcano that has alternating layers of ash, lava, and solidified rock. It is located on the western side of the Bay of Naples, and is part of the Campanian volcanic arc. This arc is a chain of volcanoes that stretches from southern Italy to the island of Ischia.</p>

<p>Mt Vesuvius is also part of a larger volcanic region known as the Campi Flegrei ("burning fields"). This area is made up of 24 volcanic craters, most of which are located around the Bay of Naples. The area is also home to several other active volcanoes, including Mt Epomeo, Mt Somma, and Mt Nuovo.</p>

<h2>History of Mt Vesuvius</h2>

<p>Mt Vesuvius has been erupting regularly since the year 79 AD, when it famously destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Since then, it has had several eruptions, the most recent one occurring in 1944. During this eruption, over 500 people died and the nearby city of San Sebastiano was completely destroyed.</p>

<p>The volcano is also famous for its Plinian eruptions. These types of eruptions are characterized by a tall, mushroom-shaped cloud of ash and gas, as well as powerful pyroclastic flows of hot ash, rocks, and gas. These flows can move at speeds of up to 100 kilometers per hour, and can reach temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h2>Dangers of Mt Vesuvius</h2>

<p>Due to its location near the densely populated city of Naples, Mt Vesuvius is a serious hazard. The city is home to over 3 million people, and an eruption could potentially cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the volcano is considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world.</p>

<p>The Italian government has taken steps to reduce the risk of an eruption. These include monitoring the volcano with a network of seismometers and tiltmeters, as well as maintaining an evacuation plan for the area. In addition, there are regular field exercises to practice for a potential eruption.</p>
