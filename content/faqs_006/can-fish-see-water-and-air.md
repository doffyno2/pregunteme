<p>Fish are unique creatures in the animal kingdom in that they have adapted to live in both water and air. But can they actually see both? As it turns out, the answer to this question is "yes." Fish can see both water and air, but their vision is limited depending on the environment they are in. In this article, we will explore how fish see in water and air, and what they can actually see. </p>

<h2>How Fish See in Water</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of fish vision is that they can see in water. This is because the water has molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen that can be detected by the eyes of the fish. The eyes of fish are specially adapted to allow them to see in water, with the lenses in their eyes being able to focus the light from the water molecules. Fish are also able to detect movement in the water, as well as changes in light intensity. This allows them to detect prey, predators, and other creatures in the water.</p>

<p>In addition to seeing in the water, fish are also able to detect colors in the water. This is because the light that passes through the water is made up of different colors, which can be seen by the fish. Fish can also detect ultraviolet light, which is invisible to humans, but is visible to fish. This allows them to detect objects and prey that are hidden in the water.</p>

<h2>How Fish See in Air</h2>

<p>Just as fish can see in water, they are also able to see in air. The eyes of fish are specially adapted to allow them to see in air, with the lenses in their eyes being able to focus the light from the air molecules. Fish are able to detect movement in the air, as well as changes in light intensity, which allows them to detect prey, predators, and other creatures in the air. </p>

<p>In addition to seeing in the air, fish are also able to detect colors in the air. This is because the light that passes through the air is made up of different colors, which can be seen by the fish. Fish can also detect ultraviolet light, which is invisible to humans, but is visible to fish. This allows them to detect objects and prey that are hidden in the air. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Fish are truly amazing creatures, and their ability to see in both water and air is just one example of their incredible adaptability. Fish can see in water and air, allowing them to detect prey, predators, and other creatures in both environments. They are also able to detect colors and ultraviolet light in both water and air, allowing them to detect objects and prey that are hidden from view. </p>
