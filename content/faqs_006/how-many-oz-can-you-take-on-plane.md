Traveling by plane can be a tedious process, and it can be made even more difficult if you are not aware of the rules and regulations regarding what items you can and cannot bring onto the aircraft. One of the most common questions travelers have when packing for a flight is how much liquid they can bring on the plane. While some liquids are allowed, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has very specific guidelines for the amount of liquid you are allowed to bring on board a plane. 

<h2>What Are the Rules Regarding Liquids on a Plane?</h2>

The TSA has set guidelines for travelers regarding what liquids they can bring on board an airplane. According to the TSA, “You are allowed to bring a quart-sized bag of liquids, aerosols, gels, creams and pastes in your carry-on bag and through the checkpoint. These are limited to travel-sized containers that are 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item.” If a container is larger than 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters), it must be checked in with your luggage. 

<h2>What Items Are Considered Liquids?</h2>

The TSA states that “Liquids include toiletries such as shampoo, after-shave, hand or body lotion, mouthwash and liquid makeup.” These items must be in containers no larger than 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) and must fit in a single quart-sized bag. The quart-sized bag must be clear and sealable, and it must fit comfortably in the one-quart bag provided by the TSA at the airport. 

<h2>Are There Any Exceptions to the TSA's Rules?</h2>

The TSA does make some exceptions to their restrictions on liquids. Medically necessary items, such as contact lens solution, insulin, and other life-sustaining liquids, are allowed in larger quantities, as long as the individual is able to provide proof that the item is medically necessary. These items must be declared at the security checkpoint and will be inspected. 

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on Aerosol Items?</h2>

The TSA also has restrictions on aerosol items, such as hairspray, shaving cream, and spray deodorant. These items must also be in containers no larger than 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) and must fit in a single quart-sized bag. If the container is larger than 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters), it must be checked in with your luggage. 

<h2>What Is the Maximum Amount of Liquids I Can Bring on the Plane?</h2>

The TSA allows travelers to bring up to 12 ounces (340 milliliters) of liquid through the security checkpoint in total. This includes all of the individual containers that fit in the quart-sized bag, so travelers should keep this in mind when packing their liquids. 

<h2>What Happens if I Have More Than 12 Ounces (340 Milliliters) of Liquid?</h2>

If a traveler has more than 12 ounces (340 milliliters) of liquid, it must be checked in with their luggage. The TSA does not allow travelers to bring more than 12 ounces (340 milliliters) of liquid through the security checkpoint. 

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on Alcoholic Beverages?</h2>

The TSA states that “alcoholic beverages greater than 140 proof are not allowed in carry-on bags and should be placed in checked baggage.” Alcoholic beverages that are 140 proof or less may be brought on board the aircraft, but they must be in containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less and must fit in a quart-sized bag. 

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on Gels and Creams?</h2>

Gels and creams, such as those found in toothpaste, shaving cream, and cosmetics, must be in containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less and must fit in a quart-sized bag. These items must be clearly labeled with the name of the product. 

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on Baby Food and Formula?</h2>

Baby food and formula may be brought on board the plane in containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less that fit in a quart-sized bag. These items must be clearly labeled with the name of the product. 

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on Pet Food?</h2>

The TSA states that “pet food is allowed in carry-on bags or checked bags. Solid pet food can be transported in either a carry-on or checked bag. Liquid, semi-solid, or gel pet food items larger than 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) are not allowed in carry-on bags and should be placed in checked bags.”
