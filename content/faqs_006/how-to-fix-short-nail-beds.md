<p>Having short nail beds can be frustrating for anyone who enjoys polishing their nails. Short nail beds can make it difficult to keep your nails looking neat, and can also make it hard to get a good manicure. Fortunately, there are several things you can do to fix short nail beds and help your nails look their best.</p>

<h2>What Causes Short Nail Beds?</h2>

<p>Short nail beds can be caused by a wide range of factors, including genetics, age, injury, or even certain illnesses. People who have naturally short nail beds are likely to have them throughout their lives, although they can be improved with the right care. People who have experienced injury or illness that has caused their nail beds to shorten may also find it difficult to get them back to normal.</p>

<h2>Tips for Fixing Short Nail Beds</h2>

<p>1. Trim your nails regularly. Trimming your nails regularly is one of the most important steps in keeping your nail beds healthy. Trimming your nails can help to keep them from becoming too long, which can make them more prone to breaking and splitting. Keeping your nails trimmed can also help to prevent the nail bed from becoming too short.</p>

<p>2. Moisturize your nails. Keeping your nails moisturized is essential for keeping them healthy and preventing them from becoming too short. Choose a moisturizer that is specifically formulated for nails and apply it regularly to keep your nail beds hydrated and healthy.</p>

<p>3. Use a nail hardener. If your nails are weak and prone to breaking, using a nail hardener can help to strengthen them and prevent them from becoming too short. Nail hardeners can also help to make your nails more resistant to damage from everyday activities, such as typing on a keyboard or opening cans.</p>

<p>4. Use a nail buffer. A nail buffer can help to even out the length of your nail beds, making them look more natural. Buffing your nails can also help to make them stronger, which can help to prevent them from becoming too short.</p>

<p>5. Take a biotin supplement. Biotin is a vitamin that can help to strengthen your nails and prevent them from becoming too short. Taking a biotin supplement can help to provide your nails with the nutrients they need to stay healthy and strong.</p>
