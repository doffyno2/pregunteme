<p>It's a summer afternoon and you're out on the town running errands. You decide to make a quick stop at the grocery store to pick up a few items. After you've finished shopping, you realize that you have to leave your purchases in the car while you continue with your day. You may be wonderingâ€”how long can you leave food in the car before it becomes unsafe to eat?</p>

<p>In general, you should not leave food in the car for longer than two hours. This is because temperatures in cars can reach upwards of 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the temperature at which bacteria will start to grow rapidly. If the food is left in the car for longer than two hours, it is likely to spoil and become unsafe to eat. It's important to note that this time frame varies based on the type of food, the temperature outside, and the temperature inside the car.</p>

<p>Foods that are particularly prone to spoilage include dairy products, eggs, deli meats, and cooked meats. These foods should be stored in a cooler with ice packs if they will be left in a car for any period of time. If the temperatures outside are above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, food should not be left in the car for more than an hour. Additionally, if the car is parked in direct sunlight, food should not be left in the car for more than 30 minutes.</p>
