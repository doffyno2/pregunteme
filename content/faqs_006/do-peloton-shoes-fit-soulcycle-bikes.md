<p>When it comes to home exercise, Peloton and SoulCycle are two of the most popular and well-known brands. Peloton bikes and SoulCycle bikes are both great options for people looking to get in shape from the comfort of their own homes. One of the biggest differences between the two brands is the type of shoes they require. While Peloton bikes require dedicated Peloton shoes, SoulCycle bikes are compatible with any SPD cleat compatible cycling shoe.</p>
