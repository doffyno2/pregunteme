<p>When it comes to hydration, water is key. A human body needs to consume a certain amount of water each day to remain healthy and hydrated. But how much is 100 oz of water in terms of bottles?

People who are engaging in more strenuous activities such as running or playing sports will need to drink more water than someone who is sitting at a desk all day.
