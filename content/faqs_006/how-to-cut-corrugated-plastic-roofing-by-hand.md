<p>Corrugated plastic roofing is an inexpensive and lightweight alternative to traditional roofing materials. It is often used for sheds, garages, and other outbuildings, and is especially popular for greenhouses. Cutting corrugated plastic roofing is a relatively simple process when done with the right tools and safety precautions.</p>

<h2>Tools Needed to Cut Corrugated Plastic Roofing</h2>

<p>Before beginning the process of cutting corrugated plastic roofing, it is important to make sure you have the right tools on hand. The most important tool is a sharp pair of scissors or shears. It’s also important to have a tape measure, a straight edge, and a marker. Finally, you’ll need safety goggles and gloves.</p>

<h2>Preparing to Cut Corrugated Plastic Roofing</h2>

<p>Before beginning the cutting process, the first step is to measure the area that needs to be cut. Measure the length, width, and height of the area, and then mark the measurements on the plastic sheeting with the marker. Using a straight edge, draw a line connecting the marks. This will be the cutting line.</p>

<p>Now that the area is measured and marked, it’s time to begin the cutting process. Put on safety goggles and gloves to protect your eyes and hands from flying debris. Place the sheet of plastic on a flat surface, making sure the cutting line is visible. Firmly hold the sheet in place with one hand, and then use the scissors to cut along the line. Make sure to cut slowly and evenly to ensure a clean cut.</p>
