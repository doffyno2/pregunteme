<p>A mini fridge is a great way to keep small amounts of food, drinks, and other items cold and fresh. But how much power does it use? In this article, we'll explain how many amps a mini fridge pulls and how you can calculate the electricity usage in your own home.</p>

<h2>What is a Mini Fridge?</h2>

<p>A mini fridge is a compact refrigerator that is used to store food and drinks in a small space. It typically has a capacity of around 4-5 cubic feet and is often used in dorm rooms, offices, or even as a secondary refrigerator in a home. Mini fridges can come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and they are often used to store beverages and fresh food.</p>

<h2>How Much Amps Does a Mini Fridge Pull?</h2>

<p>The amount of power a mini fridge uses will vary depending on the size of the unit, the age of the unit, and the type of compressor it uses.
