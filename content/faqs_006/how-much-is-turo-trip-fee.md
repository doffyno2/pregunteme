Turo is a car rental marketplace that allows renters to rent vehicles from private car owners. It’s an online platform that enables renters to search for cars, compare prices, and book their ideal rental car. Turo provides an easy way to rent cars with low trip fees. 

<h2>How Does Turo Work?</h2>

The Turo rental process starts by signing up for an account and submitting a profile. Once the profile is approved, users can start searching for cars in their area. They can search by make, model, year, and location. Once they find a car they like, they can book it. The booking process is easy, and renters can do it from their mobile phone or laptop. 

Once the car is booked, the renter will be sent a confirmation email and instructions for picking up the car. The car owner will then meet the renter at the agreed-upon time and place to hand the keys over. 

The renter will then be able to drive off with the car. The car owner will be responsible for providing the vehicle in a safe and clean condition.
