<p>Ohio is a state known for its various species of fish, but many people don't know that one of the most unique and dangerous fish species, the snakehead, can be found in some of the lakes and rivers in the state. The snakehead is an invasive species of fish that has caused major problems in other parts of the world, and its presence in Ohio is a cause for concern.</p>

<p>The snakehead is a fish native to Asia and Africa, and it has been accidentally or intentionally introduced to many other parts of the world. In Ohio, the snakehead was first found in the Grand River in 2009, and since then, it has been reported in several other water bodies, including the Muskingum River, Lake Erie, and the Ohio River. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) has been monitoring the presence of the snakehead in Ohio waters and has been working to prevent further spread of the species.</p>

<p>The snakehead is a large, predatory fish that can reach up to three feet in length and weigh up to 15 pounds. It is an aggressive fish that feeds on other fish, amphibians, and crustaceans. It has the ability to survive out of water for several days and can travel short distances by "walking" across land, which has enabled it to spread to new habitats.

<p>The presence of the snakehead in Ohio waters is a cause for concern because it can out-compete native fish species for food and habitat. It also has the potential to spread to other water bodies, which could have a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem. The ODNR is currently working to prevent the further spread of the snakehead in Ohio, and it is important that people take steps to help prevent the spread of this invasive species.</p>

<h2>How Does the Snakehead Spread?</h2>

<p>The snakehead is spread primarily through human activities, such as releasing aquarium fish into the wild, or using live bait that contains snakehead eggs. The snakehead can also spread naturally by swimming or “walking” across land. It is important to note that the snakehead can not survive long periods of time out of water, so it is unlikely that it would be able to spread far from its current habitats in Ohio.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do If You See a Snakehead in Ohio?</h2>

<p>If you see a snakehead in Ohio, it is important to report it to the ODNR. You should not attempt to capture or kill the fish yourself, as this could be illegal. The ODNR will investigate any reported sightings and take necessary steps to prevent the further spread of the species. You can report a sighting of the snakehead by calling the ODNR Division of Wildlife hotline at 1-800-WILDLIFE.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risks of the Snakehead in Ohio?</h2>

<p>The snakehead is an aggressive predator that has the potential to out-compete native fish species for food and habitat. It is also capable of spreading to other water bodies, which could have a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem. The presence of the snakehead in Ohio waters could also impact the recreational fishing industry, as anglers may be less likely to fish in areas where the snakehead is present.</p>

<h2>How Can You Help Prevent the Spread of the Snakehead?</h2>

<p>There are several steps that individuals can take to help prevent the spread of the snakehead in Ohio. It is important to never release aquarium fish into the wild, as this is one of the primary ways that the snakehead is spread. It is also important to only use bait that is free of snakehead eggs or larvae. Finally, it is important to report any sightings of the snakehead to the ODNR so that they can take necessary steps to prevent its further spread.</p>
