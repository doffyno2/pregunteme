<p>If you are playing a game that has a Player Test Realm (PTR) server, you may find yourself wanting to copy your character to the PTR server. Copying your character to the PTR server allows you to test new content and features before they are released on the live server. This article will explain how to copy your character to the PTR server.</p>

<h2>What is a Player Test Realm Server?</h2>

<p>A Player Test Realm (PTR) server is a special game server used by game developers to test upcoming changes and content before they are released to the live server. It is also used to collect feedback from players about the changes and content, allowing developers to make adjustments and improvements. Players who copy their characters to the PTR server can take part in testing the new content and features, and can provide valuable feedback to the developers.</p>

<h2>What is Character Copying?</h2>

<p>Character copying is a process by which players can copy their characters from the live server to the PTR server. This allows players to test upcoming content and features with their existing characters, rather than having to create new characters on the PTR server. This is especially useful for players who have invested a lot of time and effort into their characters, as they can continue to progress their characters while testing upcoming content.</p>

<h2>How to Copy Character to PTR?</h2>

<p>The process of copying your character to the PTR server is fairly straightforward. The first step is to log into the game's website and navigate to the character select screen. Here you will see a list of your characters and an option to copy them to the PTR server. Select the character you wish to copy and click the "copy to PTR" button. Once the copying process is complete, your character will be available on the PTR server.</p>

<p>Once your character is copied to the PTR server, you will need to log in to the PTR server to play with your character. The login screen for the PTR server will be different from the login screen for the live server. The PTR server login screen will usually have a special logo or banner indicating that it is the PTR server. Once you have logged in to the PTR server, you can begin testing upcoming content and features with your character.</p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between the Live Server and the PTR Server?</h2>

<p>The main difference between the live server and the PTR server is that the PTR server is used to test upcoming content and features. This means that the content and features available on the PTR server may be unstable or incomplete, and may change at any time. As such, it is important to remember that the PTR server is not intended for long-term play, and is only meant to be used for testing and providing feedback.</p>
