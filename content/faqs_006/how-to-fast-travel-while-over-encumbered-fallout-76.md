<p>Fast traveling in Fallout 76 can be a great way to get around the massive post-apocalyptic world, but it’s not always possible if you’re carrying too much weight. If your inventory is full and you’re over encumbered, you won’t be able to fast travel. Fortunately, there are a few ways to get around this issue and fast travel even when you’re over encumbered. </p>

<h2>Drop Your Load </h2>

<p>The simplest way to fast travel while over encumbered is to drop your load. Go to your inventory, highlight the items you want to drop, and press the appropriate button to drop them. You don’t have to discard them forever; you can just store them in your stash so you can retrieve them later. By dropping enough items, you can get your weight under the encumbered limit and fast travel.</p>

<h2>Prioritize Your Items </h2>

<p>If you don’t want to drop any of your items and still be able to fast travel, you can prioritize your inventory. Take a look at what you have in your inventory, and determine which items are the most important to keep. Put those items at the top of your inventory, and move any items you can do without to the bottom. This will make sure the most important items are weighed first, and if you’re still over encumbered, you can just discard the items at the bottom until you’re under the limit.</p>

<h2>Stash Your Load </h2>

<p>If you don’t want to drop or prioritize your items, you can store them in your stash. You can access your stash by visiting the nearest camp. Once you’re there, open up your stash and transfer the items you don’t need right away. This will reduce your encumbrance and allow you to fast travel. Just make sure you have enough space in your stash, as it has a limited capacity.</p>

<h2>Use a Power Armor </h2>

<p>If you’re wearing a Power Armor, your encumbrance won’t matter. Power Armors have a full inventory which does not count towards your encumbrance, so you can fast travel with it even if you’re over encumbered. This is a great way to get around the issue, and it also offers some added protection from the dangerous creatures you’ll encounter in the wasteland.</p>

<h2>Find a Lightweight Solution </h2>

<p>Finally, you can reduce your encumbrance by finding lightweight alternatives. For example, if you’re carrying a lot of ammo, you can switch to a weapon that uses a lighter ammo type. You can also find lighter armor and weapons, which will reduce your weight and allow you to fast travel.</p>
