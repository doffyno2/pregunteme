<p>Apple iPads are one of the most popular pieces of technology available, and with good reason. They offer all the functionality and portability of a computer in a much smaller form factor. One of the main advantages of iPads is the size of their screens. Understanding how iPad screens are measured is essential for anyone looking to buy one. The iPads are available in a variety of sizes, and knowing how they are actually measured can help you choose the right size for your needs.</p>

<h2>What Exactly Is Measured?</h2>

<p>When measuring iPad screens, the display size is usually the main point of focus. This measurement is taken diagonally, and is expressed in inches. For example, the iPad Pro 12.9-inch model has a display size of 12.9 inches. This measurement is taken from corner to corner, and is not the same as the overall size of the device.</p>

<h2>Determining Screen Resolution</h2>

<p>The resolution of an iPad's display is measured in pixels. The higher the number of pixels, the sharper and more detailed the display will be. The iPad Pro 12.9-inch model, for example, has a resolution of 2732 x 2048 pixels. This means that it can display images with a resolution of up to 2732 x 2048 pixels, providing a very sharp and clear picture.</p>

<h2>Calculating Pixel Density</h2>

<p>Pixel density is a measure of how many pixels are packed into an area of a given size. It is often expressed in pixels per inch, or PPI. The higher the PPI, the sharper the display will be. The iPad Pro 12.9-inch model has a PPI of 264, which is considered very high for a display of its size.</p>

<h2>Understanding Aspect Ratio</h2>

<p>The aspect ratio of a display refers to its width-to-height ratio. The iPad Pro 12.9-inch model, for example, has an aspect ratio of 4:3, which means that its width is 1.33 times its height. This is considered a standard aspect ratio for tablet displays.</p>

<h2>Comparing Different Models</h2>

<p>The different iPad models come in a range of sizes and resolutions. For example, the iPad Pro 11-inch model has a display size of 11 inches, a resolution of 2388 x 1668 pixels, and a PPI of 264. The iPad Pro 12.9-inch model, on the other hand, has a display size of 12.9 inches, a resolution of 2732 x 2048 pixels, and a PPI of 264. Both models have the same aspect ratio of 4:3.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Understanding how iPad screens are measured is essential for anyone looking to buy one. The display size is measured diagonally in inches, the resolution is measured in pixels, the pixel density is measured in pixels per inch, and the aspect ratio is measured in the width-to-height ratio. Comparing the different models will help you determine which one is best suited for your needs.</p>
