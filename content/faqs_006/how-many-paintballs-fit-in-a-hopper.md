Paintball is a game of strategy, skill, and accuracy. It is a game of speed, agility, and reflexes. It is a game of teamwork and camaraderie. And, of course, it is a game of paintballs. But how many paintballs can actually fit in a hopper? 

<h2>What is a Paintball Hopper?</h2>

A paintball hopper is a container that holds paintballs and feeds them into the gun. Paintball hoppers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but they all have a few things in common.

<h2>How Many Paintballs Fit in a Hopper?</h2>

The amount of paintballs that can fit in a hopper depends on the size of the hopper and the size of the paintballs. Gravity fed hoppers typically hold approximately 200 to 300 paintballs, while force-fed hoppers can hold up to 500 paintballs. Electric hoppers typically hold the most paintballs, up to 1,500.

Some hoppers are designed to fit both 0.68 and 0.72 caliber paintballs, while others are designed to fit only one size.

<h2>What Else Should I Know About Hoppers?</h2>
