<p>Vacuum leaks can cause serious issues with modern car engines, as they can lead to a decrease in fuel efficiency, a rough idle, poor acceleration and a decrease in overall engine performance. Fortunately, vacuum leak repairs are usually relatively inexpensive, though the exact cost of repair can vary depending on the source of the leak and the parts required. In this article, we'll explore the potential causes of a vacuum leak, the potential costs of repair and the steps you can take to help prevent the issue from recurring.</p>
