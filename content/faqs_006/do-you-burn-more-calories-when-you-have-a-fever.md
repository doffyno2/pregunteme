<p>When you have a fever, your body is working hard to fight off infection and stay healthy. As a result, you may find that you are burning more calories than usual. But does having a fever actually increase your calorie burn?</p>

<p>In short, the answer is yes. When you have a fever, your body has to work harder to maintain your temperature. This increased energy expenditure can lead to an increased calorie burn. But it's important to note that this increase in calorie burn is relatively small. For most people, the increase in calorie burn during a fever is not enough to make a significant difference in their overall calorie burn.</p>

<p>There are a few factors that can influence how much of an increase in calorie burn you experience when you have a fever. One factor is the severity of the fever. The higher the fever, the greater the energy expenditure and the more calories you’ll burn. The other factor is the duration of the fever. The longer the fever lasts, the higher your calorie burn will be.</p>

<h2>How to Burn More Calories When You Have a Fever</h2>

<p>If you want to maximize your calorie burn when you have a fever, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure you’re getting plenty of rest. Resting helps your body conserve energy and can help reduce the severity of the fever. Second, drink plenty of fluids. Staying hydrated can help prevent dehydration, which can increase the severity of the fever.</p>

<p>In addition, you can also try to engage in light physical activity. Some light exercise, such as walking or gentle yoga, can help you burn more calories, even when you have a fever. Just make sure to listen to your body and stop if you start to feel worse.</p>

<p>That being said, it’s important to remember that the increase in calorie burn during a fever is relatively small. It’s important to focus on getting plenty of rest and drinking plenty of fluids during a fever to help your body fight off the infection.</p>
