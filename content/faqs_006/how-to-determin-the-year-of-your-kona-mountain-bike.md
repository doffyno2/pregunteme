<p>If you are a mountain biker, you know that Kona mountain bikes are some of the best on the market. But if you have an older Kona mountain bike, you may be wondering how you can determine the year of your bike. Fortunately, Kona makes it relatively easy to determine the year of your bike. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to determine the year of your Kona mountain bike.</p>

<h2>Check The Serial Number</h2>

<p>The first step in figuring out the year of your Kona mountain bike is to check the serial number. All Kona mountain bikes have a serial number, usually found on the underside of the bottom bracket. The serial number should have a two-digit number that indicates the year of production. For example, if the serial number has a “19” at the end, the bike was made in 2019. If the serial number has a “18” at the end, the bike was made in 2018. This is the quickest and easiest way to determine the year of your Kona mountain bike.</p>

<h2>Check The Warranty Card</h2>

<p>Another way to determine the year of your Kona mountain bike is to check the warranty card. Many Kona mountain bikes come with a warranty card that indicates the year of production. This is especially true for newer Kona mountain bikes. If you have a warranty card for your bike, you can look at the date on the card to determine the year of production. However, if your Kona mountain bike does not come with a warranty card, this method will not work for you.</p>

<h2>Check The Frame</h2>

<p>The last way to determine the year of your Kona mountain bike is to check the frame. Many Kona mountain bikes have a date stamped onto the frame. This date is usually located on the underside of the bottom bracket. If the bike has a date stamped onto the frame, this will give you an indication of the year of production. However, it is important to note that this method is not always reliable, as the date stamped onto the frame may not always be accurate.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>In most cases, the year of production will not affect the performance of your Kona mountain bike. However, newer bikes may be equipped with newer technologies that can improve the performance of your bike.</p>

<h3>What other information can I find on the serial number?</h3>

<p>In addition to indicating the year of production, the serial number may also provide information about the model of your Kona mountain bike. For example, some serial numbers may indicate the type of frame, components, and other features.</p>

<h3>What should I do if I can’t find the serial number on my Kona mountain bike?</h3>
