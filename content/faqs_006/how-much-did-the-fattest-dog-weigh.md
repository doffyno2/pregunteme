Dogs come in all shapes and sizes, and some can get quite big. But did you know the fattest dog ever recorded was a hefty 150kg? That's heavier than a fully grown human! 

In this article, we'll take a look at the heaviest dog ever recorded, and all the other contenders for the title of fattest dog. We'll also find out what health risks come with being overweight, and what steps you can take to keep your canine companion at a healthy weight.

<h2>The Heaviest Dog Ever Recorded</h2>

The fattest dog ever recorded was a Neapolitan Mastiff named Zorba. Zorba weighed an incredible 150kg, making him much heavier than the average human. He lived in the United Kingdom and was owned by Anne Heritage, who had to build a special cart for Zorba to move around in. 

Zorba's size was due to a combination of genetics and improper diet. He was fed up to 10kg of food per day, and was allowed to eat as much as he wanted. His owners recognized that he was overweight, but weren't able to control his diet. 

<h2>Other Contenders for Fattest Dog</h2>

The Guinness World Records lists the heaviest living dog as being a male English Mastiff named Freddy. Freddy weighed 123.8kg when weighed in 2019. He was owned by Claire Stoneman of Australia. 

The Guinness World Records also lists the heaviest dog ever as being a male Saint Bernard named Benedictine. He weighed an incredible 159.6kg, but sadly died in 1793.
