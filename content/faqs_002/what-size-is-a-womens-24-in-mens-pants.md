What Size is a Women's 24 in Men's Pants?
Are you ever in a situation where you need to buy pants for someone else, but you’re not sure what size they wear? If you’re shopping for a woman but only know the size she wears in men’s pants, then you may be wondering what size is a women’s 24 in men’s pants?



When it comes to clothing, it’s important to remember that men’s and women’s sizing is not the same. Even if you’re buying for someone who wears the same size in men’s and women’s clothing, the fit won’t be the same. Men’s clothing tends to be larger than women’s clothing, so it’s important to know the conversion between men’s and women’s sizes. 

<h2>What is a Women’s 24 in Men’s Pants?</h2>

A women’s 24 in men’s pants is equivalent to a men’s size 28. This means that if you’re shopping for a woman who wears a size 24 in men’s pants, you should look for a size 28 in women’s pants. 

<h2>What Does Men’s and Women’s Sizing Mean?</h2>

Men’s and women’s sizing refers to the measurements used to determine the size of clothing. Men’s sizing is usually based on waist, hip, and inseam measurements, while women’s sizing is usually based on bust, waist, and hip measurements. This is why it’s important to know the difference between men’s and women’s sizing when shopping for clothing. 

<h2>Why is Men’s and Women’s Sizing Different?</h2>

Men’s and women’s sizing is different because men and women have different body shapes. Men tend to have broader shoulders and narrower hips than women, so their clothing needs to be cut differently. Women’s clothing is usually cut to accommodate their curves, while men’s clothing is cut to be more boxy and straight. 

<h2>How to Convert Men’s to Women’s Sizing?</h2>

Converting men’s to women’s sizing can be tricky, especially when it comes to pants. However, there are some general guidelines that you can use to make sure you’re getting the right size. Generally, you should subtract 4 from the men’s size to get the corresponding women’s size. So, a men’s size 24 is equivalent to a women’s size 20. 

<h2>How to Measure for Men’s and Women’s Pants?</h2>

When shopping for pants, it’s important to know how to measure for the right size. For men’s pants, you should measure the waist and inseam. The waist should be measured around the natural waistline, while the inseam should be measured from the crotch to the bottom of the leg. For women’s pants, you should measure the waist, hips, and inseam.
