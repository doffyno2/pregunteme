The Conjuring House is an iconic historical landmark located in the small town of Harrisville, Rhode Island, that is said to be haunted by multiple spirits. This house is most famously known for being the setting for the hit horror movie series The Conjuring, based on the real-life paranormal investigations conducted by Ed and Lorraine Warren in the 1970s. The house has been a source of fascination for many paranormal enthusiasts and has become a tourist attraction due to its eerie backstory.

<h2>The Haunted History of the Conjuring House</h2>
The Conjuring House was built in the early 1700s by John and Sarah Arnold, who moved to Harrisville from Massachusetts. The house remained in the Arnold family until the early 20th century, when it was sold to the Snedeker family. It was during this time that the Snedekers began to experience strange events in the house, such as objects moving on their own, strange sounds, and apparitions. 

The Snedeker family contacted Ed and Lorraine Warren for help in 1971, and the couple conducted several months of investigations in the house. During their investigations, the Warrens encountered several spirits, including a seven-foot-tall demon known as Bathsheba. The Warrens determined that the house was haunted by a witch named Bathsheba Sherman, who had cursed the house with her dark magic. 

<h2>The Current Owners of the Conjuring House</h2>
The Conjuring House was sold to the current owners, Norma and Carmen Snedeker, in the early 2000s. The couple has since opened up the house to visitors, offering guided tours and paranormal investigations.
