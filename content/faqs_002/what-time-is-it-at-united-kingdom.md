The United Kingdom (UK) is a group of islands off the northwest coast of Europe, comprising England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. With a population of over 66 million people, the UK is a vibrant and diverse nation with a rich history and culture. The UK is also known for its distinctive time zones, which can be confusing for visitors and those who are unfamiliar with the local customs. So, what time is it in the UK?

<h2>Time Zones in the United Kingdom</h2>

The UK is split into three distinct time zones: Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in England, Wales, and Scotland; British Summer Time (BST) in England, Wales, and Scotland; and Irish Standard Time (IST) in Northern Ireland. 

<h3>Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</h3>

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the time zone for the UK mainland, covering England, Wales, and Scotland. As the name suggests, it is based on the average solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. The time zone is five hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In summer, GMT is converted to British Summer Time (BST) when the clocks are put forward one hour.

<h3>British Summer Time (BST)</h3>

When the clocks go forward in spring, the UK mainland is converted to British Summer Time (BST). This is the UKâ€™s daylight saving time and is one hour ahead of GMT. BST is observed from the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October. During this period, the clocks go back one hour to GMT in the autumn.

<h3>Irish Standard Time (IST)</h3>

Northern Ireland is one hour ahead of the UK mainland and observes Irish Standard Time (IST). IST is the same as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) but is not adjusted for daylight saving time.
