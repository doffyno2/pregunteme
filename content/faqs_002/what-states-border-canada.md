<h2>Canada's Land Borders</h2>

Canada is bordered by three countries and nine US states. The longest border between Canada and the United States is the 5,525-mile-long Canada–United States border. It runs from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west, and is the world's longest land border.

<h2>Geographical Features of Canada's Borders</h2>

The Canada-United States border is marked by a variety of geographical features, including rivers, lakes, mountains, and valleys. The border also runs through major urban centres, including Montreal and Toronto.

The border between Canada and Greenland is the Davis Strait, a body of water that separates the two countries. The sea is home to a variety of fish species, including cod, halibut, and herring. 

The border between Canada and Norway's Svalbard is the Arctic Ocean. The sea is known for its cold temperatures and is home to a variety of sea mammals, including walruses, polar bears, and narwhals.

<h2>Importance of Canada's Borders</h2>

Canada's borders are important for a variety of reasons. The border between Canada and the United States is the longest undefended border in the world and serves as an important symbol of the two countries' close relationship.

The borders between Canada and Greenland and Norway's Svalbard are also important, as they provide a buffer zone between the two countries and help to protect Canada's sovereignty.

<h2>Border Security</h2>

Despite its long and undefended border with the United States, Canada takes border security very seriously. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is responsible for protecting Canada's borders. The CBSA operates at ports of entry, monitors air, land and sea travel, and helps to ensure that laws and regulations concerning immigration, customs, and security are enforced.

The CBSA also works with other Canadian government departments and agencies, as well as with the United States and other international partners, to ensure the safety and security of Canadians.

<h2>Border Crossings</h2>

Crossing the border between Canada and the United States is relatively easy. There are more than 120 ports of entry along the border, and travellers can cross with valid identification and a passport or other travel document.

Crossing the border between Canada and Greenland is more difficult, as there are fewer ports of entry and the crossing can take up to five days.

Crossing the border between Canada and Norway's Svalbard is even more difficult, as there are no ports of entry and travellers must obtain special permission to enter the islands.
