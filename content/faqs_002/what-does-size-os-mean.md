What Does Size OS Mean?

We understand that it can be quite confusing when it comes to learning about sizing for shoes, clothing, and accessories, especially when there is more than one sizing system available.

Size OS is a sizing system often used for shoes, apparel, and accessories that stands for "One Size". This means that the item is only available in a single size and does not come in multiple sizes.
