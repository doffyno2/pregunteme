<h2>The History of Standard Time in Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>The concept of standard time was first proposed by Canadian railway engineer Sir Sandford Fleming in 1879. At the time, each city and town around the world had their own local time based on the position of the sun in the sky. This made coordination between locations difficult as each city had a different time. Fleming proposed that the world should be divided into 24 time zones based on the Greenwich Meridian. This would make it easier for people to communicate with each other, as well as for transportation.</p>

<p>The first time zone in Pennsylvania was established in 1883. The time zone was based on the meridian running through Philadelphia. This was later changed to the current Eastern Standard Time zone in 1918. At that time, the entire state of Pennsylvania was placed in the EST time zone.</p>

<h2>Daylight Saving Time in Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Daylight Saving Time (DST) is a practice of setting clocks forward by one hour during the spring and summer months.

The state has adopted Daylight Saving Time every year since then, with the exception of a few years during World War II.</p>
