<p>Many dog owners may be wondering what do normal dog testicles look like. After all, if your pup is neutered, you may have never seen a full set of testicles on a dog before. It can be helpful to know what a normal set of dog testicles looks like in case you ever need to inspect your pup’s genital area.</p>

<h2>What Are Dog Testicles?</h2>

<p>Dog testicles are organs that are located in the scrotal sac, which is found on either side of the penis. The testicles produce sperm and male hormones, such as testosterone. They are two oval-shaped organs that are covered with a thin membrane called the tunica albuginea.</p>

<h2>What Do Dog Testicles Look Like?</h2>

<p>Normal dog testicles are usually small, oval-shaped organs that are about the size of a grape or small marble. They can range in color from light pink or white to a darker, purplish hue. The size and color of the testicles will usually be the same on both sides. Many testicles will have a small amount of fur on them, although some breeds may have more than others.</p>

<p>In some cases, the testicles may appear to be slightly swollen or enlarged. This could be a sign of an infection or other medical issue, and it’s important to contact your vet if you notice this. It’s also important to note that the testicles may appear to be slightly different in size and shape from one side to the other; this is perfectly normal and nothing to be concerned about.</p>

<h2>What Else Should I Look For?</h2>

<p>In addition to inspecting the size and color of the testicles, you should also take note of any lumps or bumps that may be present. While these could be something as innocuous as an ingrown hair, they could also be a sign of a serious medical condition such as testicular cancer. If you notice anything abnormal, contact your vet immediately.</p>

<h2>When Should I Inspect My Dog’s Testicles?</h2>

<p>Ideally, you should be inspecting your pup’s genital area on a regular basis. This can help you detect any potential problems or changes in the size and shape of the testicles. If you have never inspected your pup’s testicles before, it’s a good idea to get into the habit of doing so. This can help you catch any medical issues early on and get your pup the help he needs.</p>
