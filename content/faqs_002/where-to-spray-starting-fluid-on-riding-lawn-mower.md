Where to Spray Starting Fluid on Riding Lawn Mower

<p>Starting fluid is a fuel additive that helps to start a lawn mower engine, especially when the engine is cold or has been sitting for a while. It is applied directly to the engine and is essential in helping to get a lawn mower started. However, it is important to know where to spray starting fluid on a riding lawn mower in order to ensure that it is applied correctly and safely.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is to never spray starting fluid into the air filter or the carburetor. This can cause a fire or explosion. Instead, it should be sprayed directly into the engine's intake manifold, which is located low on the engine. This is usually just above the oil filter and is marked with a small black box.</p>

<h2>Steps for Applying Starting Fluid</h2>
<p>After you have located the intake manifold, follow these steps to apply starting fluid correctly and safely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check that the engine is cool before spraying.</li>
  <li>Check the engine oil level to make sure it is full.</li>
  <li>Check the fuel level in the tank to make sure it is full.</li>
  <li>Check the air filter to make sure it is clean and free of debris.</li>
  <li>Check the spark plug to make sure it is properly connected and in good condition.</li>
  <li>Open the hood of the mower and locate the intake manifold.</li>
  <li>Spray one or two squirts of starting fluid into the intake manifold.</li>
  <li>Close the hood and attempt to start the mower.</li>
  <li>If the mower fails to start, repeat steps 6-8.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Safety Tips</h2>
<p>It is important to follow these safety tips when applying starting fluid to a riding lawn mower:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Never spray starting fluid near an open flame or spark.</li>
  <li>Never spray starting fluid into the air filter or the carburetor.</li>
  <li>Always wear safety goggles and gloves when spraying.</li>
  <li>Always keep the container of starting fluid upright and away from children.</li>
  <li>Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Know if the Mower is Flooded</h2>
<p>It is important to know if the mower is flooded before attempting to start it. A flooded engine will not start, even if starting fluid is used. To determine if the mower is flooded, check to see if the spark plug is wet. If it is, then the engine is flooded and must be dried out before it can be started. To dry out the engine, remove the spark plug and turn the engine over several times. This will allow the gasoline to drain out and allow the engine to start. Once the engine is dry, replace the spark plug and attempt to start it.</p>

<h2>What to do if the Mower Still Won't Start</h2>
<p>If the mower still won't start after applying starting fluid and drying out the engine, there may be a deeper problem. The carburetor may be clogged or the air filter may be dirty, preventing the mower from starting. In this case, it is best to take the mower to a qualified repair shop for servicing and repairs.</p>
