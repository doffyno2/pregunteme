<p>Sprays are one of the most popular features in Team Fortress 2 (TF2), and they can be used to show off your personal style, express yourself, and even advertise your favorite products. Unfortunately, there are times when you can't see sprays in the game, and this can be incredibly frustrating.  In this article, we'll explain what sprays are, why you might not be able to see them, and how you can get them back.</p>

<h2>What are Sprays?</h2>

<p>Sprays are small images that players can put onto surfaces in TF2. They're usually used to show off a player's personal style or to advertise a product or service. You can create your own sprays in a variety of different formats, including .png, .jpg, and .gif. Sprays can be used for a variety of different purposes, including expressing yourself, advertising your favorite products, and even showing off your artistic skills.</p>

<h2>Why Can't I See Sprays?</h2>

<p>There are a few different reasons why you might not be able to see sprays in TF2. The most common reason is that your graphics settings are set too low. If your graphics settings are set too low, the game won't be able to render the sprays correctly. Additionally, the game may not be able to load the sprays if you have too many other programs running in the background.</p>

<p>Another reason you might not be able to see sprays is that they've been disabled by the server. Some servers don't allow players to use sprays, so if you're playing on one of these servers, you won't be able to see them. Additionally, some servers may have disabled sprays for a specific reason, such as to reduce lag or to keep the game running smoothly.</p>

<h2>How Can I Get Sprays Back?</h2>

<p>If you can't see sprays in TF2, there are a few things you can do to try and get them back. The first thing you should do is check your graphics settings. If they're set too low, try increasing them and see if that helps. Additionally, you should check to make sure you don't have too many other programs running in the background.</p>

<p>If your graphics settings are set correctly and you don't have too many other programs running, then you should check to see if the server has disabled sprays. If sprays are disabled on the server, there's nothing you can do to get them back. However, if they're not disabled, you should be able to see them once the server has been restarted.</p>
