What Is The First Month Of Autumn?



Autumn is one of the most beautiful seasons of the year, and it brings with it a sense of wonder and excitement as the summer fades away and the cooler temperatures of the season begin to arrive. But when exactly does autumn begin? When is the first month of autumn?

The answer to this question depends on where you live in the world. In the Northern Hemisphere, autumn typically begins on the autumnal equinox, which arrives in late September or early October. In the Southern Hemisphere, autumn begins on the vernal equinox, which arrives in late March or early April.

<h2>What Is The Autumnal Equinox?</h2>

The autumnal equinox occurs when the sun crosses the equator, signaling the end of summer and the start of autumn. This event usually occurs on September 22 or 23 in the Northern Hemisphere, and on March 20 or 21 in the Southern Hemisphere. On the day of the equinox, the sun rises due east and sets due west.

<h2>Why Do Seasons Change?</h2>

Seasons change because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Earth's axis is an imaginary line that runs through the North and South Poles. It's tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees. As the Earth orbits around the Sun, the tilt of its axis causes the amount of sunlight hitting different parts of the planet to change.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the tilting of the Earth's axis away from the Sun in late September causes the days to get shorter and the temperatures to drop, marking the start of autumn. In the Southern Hemisphere, it's the oppositeâ€”the Earth's tilt toward the Sun in late March causes the days to get longer and the temperatures to rise, signaling the start of autumn.

<h2>What Are The Different Seasons Of Autumn?</h2>

The season of autumn is typically divided into three distinct parts: early autumn, mid-autumn, and late autumn. Each of these parts is characterized by different weather patterns and temperatures.

Early autumn, which lasts from late September to early October, is usually the mildest part of the season. Temperatures are still relatively warm, and there is often a lot of sunshine. This is a great time for outdoor activities such as hiking or biking.

Mid-autumn, which lasts from mid-October to late November, is typically the coldest part of the season. Temperatures begin to drop, and there is often rain and snow. This is a great time for indoor activities such as baking, crafts, and movie nights.

Late autumn, which lasts from late November to mid-December, is usually the mildest part of the season. Temperatures begin to rise, and there is often sunshine. This is a great time for outdoor activities such as apple picking and visiting pumpkin patches.

<h2>What Is The Weather Like In Autumn?</h2>

The weather in autumn varies greatly depending on where you live in the world. In general, temperatures begin to drop as the days get shorter and the nights get longer. In some places, like the Northern Hemisphere, autumn is characterized by cool, crisp days and chilly nights. In other places, like the Southern Hemisphere, autumn is characterized by warm days and cool nights.

No matter where you live, autumn is often a very beautiful season. The leaves on trees change color and fall to the ground, creating a stunning landscape. There is often a wide variety of outdoor activities to enjoy, such as apple picking, hiking, and visiting pumpkin patches.
