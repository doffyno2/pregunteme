The classic question of what do pink and blue make is often asked by young children when first learning about the concept of two colors being combined. It’s a simple but powerful concept that can be used to introduce children to the idea of how different colors can be combined to create new ones. The answer to this question is that when pink and blue are combined, they make purple.

<h2>The Basics of Color Combinations</h2>

The basics of color combinations involve the mixing of two primary colors to create a third color. These primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. Red and blue when mixed together make purple, while blue and yellow make green. Red and yellow make orange. This is known as the subtractive theory of color mixing, meaning that the result of combining two colors together is a darker color than the two that were originally used.

<h2>The Color Wheel</h2>

The color wheel is a visual representation of these primary colors and their combinations. It’s a circular diagram that displays the different colors and their relationships with one another. On the wheel, the primary colors are located at the top, with the secondary colors below them. The tertiary colors are located in between the primary and secondary colors. This visual representation can be used to teach kids about the different color combinations, as well as their relationships with one another.

<h2>Color Mixing with Pink and Blue</h2>

When pink and blue are mixed together, the result is purple. Pink is a secondary color, which means that it is made up of two primary colors, red and white. Blue is also a secondary color, made up of the two primary colors, blue and yellow. Therefore, when pink and blue are combined, the result is a mix of red and blue, which makes purple.

<h2>The Science Behind Color Combinations</h2>

The science behind color combinations is based on the fact that light is composed of different wavelengths. Each of these wavelengths corresponds to a different color. When two of these colors are combined, the result is a third color. This is why when pink and blue are combined, the result is purple.
