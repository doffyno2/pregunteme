<p>Backfiring is a loud, unexpected sound that occurs when a car's engine misfires. It is caused by a combination of unburned fuel and air entering the exhaust system, resulting in an explosive sound. The sound of a car backfiring can range depending on the engine size and type, but in general it is a loud, sharp sound that can be alarming to hear. Fortunately, backfiring is usually not a serious problem and can be fixed with a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Car to Backfire?</h2>

<p>Car backfiring is caused when the air and fuel mixture in the engine is not burning correctly. This can be caused by a number of issues, such as a faulty spark plug, clogged air filter, or a fuel injector that is not working correctly.
