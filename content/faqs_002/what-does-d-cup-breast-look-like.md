<p>When it comes to bra sizes, a D cup is considered to be on the larger side. It’s a great size to have if you’re looking for a supportive bra that lifts and shapes your bust. But what exactly does a D cup breast look like? We’ll explore this question and other details about the D cup size in this article.</p>

<h2>What Does the D Cup Size Mean?</h2>

<p>When it comes to bra sizes, the cups are designated by letters. The letters A, B, C, and D indicate the size of the cup, with D being the largest.

This means that a D cup bra is designed to provide more coverage and support than a smaller cup size.</p>

<h2>How is the D Cup Size Measured?</h2>

<p>The D cup size is determined by measuring the circumference of the chest at its fullest point (usually right below the bust) and subtracting the band size. For example, if a woman’s chest measures 36 inches and her band size is 34, then her cup size is a D. The difference between the two measurements determines the cup size.</p>
