TSA PreCheck is a program established by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that allows travelers to go through security screening faster and more efficiently. The program was designed to speed up the process of getting through airport security and provide more convenience for travelers.

TSA PreCheck is available to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, as well as some members of the military and select other travelers. TSA PreCheck members are given a unique identification number (UE ID) that is used to determine their eligibility for the program. To become a member, travelers must submit an application and provide certain personal information, including their full name, date of birth, and Social Security number.

<h2>How Does TSA PreCheck Work?</h2>

Once a traveler becomes a member of TSA PreCheck, they are given a unique identification number (UE ID). This number is used to identify them as a member of the program and can be found on the back of their boarding pass. When a traveler arrives at the airport, they can proceed directly to the designated TSA PreCheck security lane, without having to remove their shoes, laptops, liquids, belts, and light jackets. 

Once the traveler is in the TSA PreCheck security lane, they will be asked to present their boarding pass and the UE ID number to the TSA agent. The agent will then scan the boarding pass and UE ID to confirm the traveler’s membership in the program. Once the traveler’s membership is confirmed, they will be allowed to proceed through security without having to remove any items.

<h2>Benefits of TSA PreCheck</h2>

TSA PreCheck offers several benefits to travelers. The most obvious benefit is the time saved by not having to remove items such as shoes, laptops, liquids, belts, and light jackets. This can save travelers up to 15 minutes in security lines. Additionally, TSA PreCheck members are eligible for expedited screening at more than 200 U.S. airports, meaning they can get through security faster than non-members.

TSA PreCheck also offers an increased sense of security for travelers. Members of the program are subject to a more thorough background check than non-members, ensuring that only those with no criminal record or other issues are allowed to participate. This provides an additional layer of security for travelers, as well as peace of mind.

<h2>Who is Eligible for TSA PreCheck?</h2>

TSA PreCheck is available to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, as well as some members of the military and select other travelers. To become a member, travelers must submit an application and provide certain personal information, including their full name, date of birth, and Social Security number. 

Travelers must also be willing to undergo a background check by the TSA, as well as completing an in-person interview. The background check includes a review of the traveler’s criminal record, immigration status, and other factors that may make them ineligible for the program. 

<h2>How Much Does TSA PreCheck Cost?</h2>

TSA PreCheck is currently available for a fee of $85 for a five-year membership. This fee covers the cost of the background check and in-person interview. Applicants who are approved for the program will receive a unique identification number (UE ID) that is valid for five years.
