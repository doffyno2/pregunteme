Traveling to the United States has become increasingly difficult with the recent changes to the visa waiver program. To make the process easier and more efficient, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has created a program called Global Entry. Global Entry is a trusted traveler program that allows eligible travelers to bypass the traditional passport control process and instead quickly and easily pass through US customs. As part of the Global Entry program, travelers are issued a special card, known as a Global Entry card. This card contains a unique identifier known as a Known Traveler Number (KTN), which is used to identify the traveler when they enter the United States.

<h2>What is the Purpose of a Known Traveler Number (KTN)?</h2>

The purpose of a Known Traveler Number is to identify travelers who have been pre-approved for expedited entry into the United States. The KTN is a unique number, assigned to each Global Entry participant, which is used to verify the traveler's identity at the airport. The KTN is linked to the traveler's passport number, so it can be used to quickly cross-check the traveler's identity and ensure they are who they say they are.

<h2>How Do I Get a Known Traveler Number (KTN)?</h2>

In order to get a Known Traveler Number, you must first apply for the Global Entry program and be approved. The application process includes an online application, an in-person interview and a background check. Once you are approved for the program, you will be issued a Global Entry card, which contains your Known Traveler Number.

<h2>Where Do I Find My Known Traveler Number (KTN)?</h2>

Your Known Traveler Number is printed on the front of your Global Entry card. It is the nine-digit code located underneath the barcode. It is also printed on the back of the card, underneath your photo.

<h2>How Do I Use My Known Traveler Number (KTN)?</h2>

When you travel to the United States, you will be required to present your Global Entry card at the airport. The CBP officer will scan your card to verify your identity and check your Known Traveler Number. You will then be able to proceed through the expedited Global Entry line. 

<h2>What Other Benefits Does My Known Traveler Number (KTN) Offer?</h2>

In addition to expedited entry into the United States, your Known Traveler Number also offers other benefits. For example, some airlines offer discounts to Global Entry members. You may also be eligible for reduced screening at airports in other countries.
