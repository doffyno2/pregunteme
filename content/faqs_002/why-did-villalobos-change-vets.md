For many pet owners, the thought of changing their pet’s vet can be daunting, especially if their pet has been seeing the same vet for years.

The second reason was that the previous vet was not always able to provide the specialized care that some of the animals required. With a large number of animals in their care, Villalobos needed to find a vet that could provide the specialized care that some of the animals needed.
