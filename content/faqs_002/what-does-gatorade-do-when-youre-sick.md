When it comes to being sick, staying hydrated is one of the most important things you can do. But what if you're not a fan of plain water? Is Gatorade a good substitute?

<h2>What is Gatorade?</h2>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Gatorade When You're Sick?</h2>

Finally, Gatorade can interfere with certain medications, so it is important to consult with your doctor before drinking it. 

<h2>When Should You Avoid Gatorade When You're Sick?</h2>

Gatorade should be avoided if you are on a low-sodium or low-sugar diet. It should also be avoided if you have kidney or heart problems, as high amounts of sodium and sugar can be dangerous. Additionally, if you are taking certain medications, it is best to consult with your doctor before drinking Gatorade.

<h2>What Are Some Alternatives to Gatorade When You're Sick?</h2>
