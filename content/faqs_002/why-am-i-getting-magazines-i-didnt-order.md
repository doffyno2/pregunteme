<p>Getting magazines in the mail that you didn't order can be a confusing and frustrating experience. It's especially confusing if you don't know why you're receiving them in the first place. It's even more frustrating if you're getting charged for them. But what does it mean when you're getting magazines you didn't order? In this article, we'll discuss why you may be receiving magazines that you didn't order, and how to stop them.</p>

<h2>What Is Magazine Subscription Fraud?</h2>
