<p>Putting on a dog harness is a relatively easy task and can be done in just a few minutes. However, it’s important to make sure that the harness fits correctly and comfortably for your pet so that they can enjoy their walks without feeling restricted. Here are some tips on how to put on a Top Paw dog harness.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Measure Your Dog</h2>

<p>Before you start, it’s important to make sure that the harness you’re using is the right size for your dog. To do this, measure your dog’s chest and neck both with a flexible measuring tape. Make sure that you measure from the base of the neck to the widest part of the chest, and then refer to the size chart on the packaging of the harness to make sure you get the right size.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Put The Harness On</h2>

<p>Now that you have the right size, you can put the harness on your dog. Place the harness over your dog’s head so that the chest strap is at the widest part of the chest. Make sure that the harness is not too tight and that the straps are not digging into your dog’s skin.</p>

<p>Next, take the two straps at the back of the harness and slide them through the loops at the front of the harness. This will help secure the harness in place, and will also make it easier to adjust the straps to the right fit.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Adjust The Straps</h2>

<p>Adjust the straps of the harness so that they fit snugly, but not too tightly around your dog’s chest and neck. You should be able to fit two fingers between the straps and your dog’s body. This will ensure that your dog is comfortable and can move freely while wearing the harness.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Secure The Buckles</h2>

<p>Once the straps are adjusted, it’s time to secure the buckles. Make sure that all the buckles are tightly fastened and that the straps are not loose. This will ensure that the harness stays in place and doesn’t come undone during a walk.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Put On A Leash</h2>

<p>Finally, attach a leash to the D-ring on the back of the harness. This will make sure that your dog is securely attached to you and can’t wander off during your walk.</p>
