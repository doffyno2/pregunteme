The sternum, or breastbone, is a flat bone located at the center of the chest. It’s connected to the ribs on either side and protects the organs of the chest. It’s also the point of attachment for some of the muscles of the chest and back. As you move and stretch, you may sometimes hear or feel a popping or cracking sound coming from your sternum. In this article, we’ll take a look at what causes this popping sound and what it means for your health.

<h2>What Causes Sternum Popping?</h2>

When you move and stretch, your sternum may pop due to a variety of causes. In some cases, it’s nothing to worry about and is simply a normal phenomenon. In other cases, it may be indicative of a more serious underlying condition.

<h3>Normal Popping</h3>

In most cases, sternum popping is caused by normal movement of the sternum and the surrounding structures. As we move and stretch, our sternum and ribs can rub against each other and create a popping or cracking sound. This is more likely to occur in people who are more flexible or have more mobile sternums.

<h3>Hypermobility Syndrome</h3>

Hypermobility syndrome is a condition in which your joints are more mobile than normal. It’s most commonly seen in the shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles, but it can also affect the sternum. If you have hypermobility syndrome, your sternum may pop more often and more intensely when you move and stretch.

<h3>Sternoclavicular Joint Dysfunction</h3>

The sternoclavicular joint is the joint that connects the sternum to the collarbone. If this joint becomes inflamed or irritated, it can cause popping and cracking in the sternum. This can be caused by an injury, a repetitive motion injury, or an underlying health condition.

<h3>Costochondritis</h3>

Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the sternum. This condition can cause pain and tenderness in the chest and can cause the sternum to pop or crack when you move or stretch.

<h2>When Should You See a Doctor?</h2>

In most cases, sternum popping is not a cause for concern. However, if you experience pain or tenderness in the sternum area, difficulty breathing, or any other symptoms, you should see a doctor. Your doctor will be able to determine if there is an underlying medical condition that is causing the symptoms.

<h2>How to Prevent Sternum Popping</h2>

There are a few things you can do to reduce the chances of your sternum popping when you move and stretch.

<h3>Stretch Regularly</h3>

Stretching can help keep your joints and muscles flexible and reduce the chances of your sternum popping when you move. Regular stretching can also help reduce the symptoms of hypermobility syndrome.

<h3>Avoid Repetitive Motions</h3>

Repetitive motions, such as those used in certain sports or activities, can cause the sternoclavicular joint to become irritated and lead to sternum popping. If you participate in activities that involve repetitive motions, be sure to take breaks and give your body time to rest.

<h3>See a Doctor</h3>

If you experience frequent sternum popping, see a doctor. They can determine if there is an underlying condition that is causing the popping and recommend treatment.
