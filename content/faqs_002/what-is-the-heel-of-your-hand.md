<p>The heel of your hand is a term that is commonly used in martial arts and self-defense techniques. It is the area of your hand that is located just below your fingers and is used to strike and block. It is an important part of your body that is used in many martial arts techniques and should be trained and developed properly.</p>

<p>The heel of your hand is composed of three main bones: the metacarpal bones, the carpals, and the phalanges. The metacarpals are the five long bones of your hand, which connect your wrist to your fingers. The carpals are the eight small bones that make up the wrist joint, and the phalanges are the bones of your fingers. Together, these three bones form the heel of your hand.</p>

<p>When executing a punch or block, the heel of your hand is used to provide stability and power. It is important to remember to keep your wrist straight and your elbow bent to support the power of the strike. When blocking, the heel of your hand is used to absorb and deflect the impact of the strike. It is important to practice proper form and technique to develop strength, speed, and power.</p>

<p>In addition to its use in martial arts, the heel of your hand is also used in everyday activities. It is used to grip objects, hold tools, or type on a keyboard. It is important to keep the heel of your hand strong and flexible to perform these activities. Stretching and strengthening exercises can help maintain proper hand health.</p>
