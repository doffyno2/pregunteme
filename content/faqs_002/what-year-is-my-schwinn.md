<p>Schwinn is one of the most recognizable bicycle brands in the world. From the classic Stingray and the timeless cruisers to modern fitness machines, the Schwinn brand has stood the test of time. But, how do you know what year your Schwinn bicycle is from?</p>

<h2>How to Identify the Year of Your Schwinn Bicycle</h2>

<p>If you want to know what year your Schwinn bicycle is from, the best place to start is by looking for the serial number. The serial number can be found on the underside of the bike’s frame, usually near the bottom bracket or the rear dropouts. The serial number is usually a combination of letters and numbers, and it can tell you the production year of the bike.</p>

<p>Schwinn used a two-letter coding system to identify the year of production. The first letter is the month of production and the second letter is the last digit of the year. For example, the letter “A” stands for January and “B” stands for February. The letter “9” stands for the year 2019 and “0” stands for the year 2020.</p>

<p>You can also use the Schwinn Catalog Library to find the year of production. The Catalog Library contains detailed information about all Schwinn bikes, including year of production. All you need to do is enter the model of your bike and the year of production will be displayed.</p>
