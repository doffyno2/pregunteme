<p>Netflix is known for having a wide variety of movies and TV shows available to stream, but one thing that it doesn’t have a lot of is workout videos. While there are a few available, you’ll find that there are far more workout videos available on other streaming services like Amazon Prime, Hulu, and YouTube. So why can’t you find workout videos on Netflix?</p>

<h2>What Types of Workout Videos Are Available on Netflix?</h2>

<p>Netflix does have a limited selection of workout videos that you can stream, but they are mostly focused on Pilates and yoga. While this is great for those looking for a more relaxed workout, it doesn’t offer much for those looking for more intense workouts like HIIT or weightlifting. Netflix also doesn’t have any videos that show you how to perform specific exercises, which can be helpful if you’re trying to learn how to do something new.</p>

<h2>Why Don’t They Have More Workout Videos?</h2>

<p>The main reason why Netflix doesn’t have more workout videos is because they focus more on creating their own original content. This means that they don’t spend much time and money acquiring the rights to stream existing workout videos. They also don’t have the same kind of resources that other streaming services have, which means they can’t create their own workout videos. This is why you’ll find more workout videos on other streaming services.</p>

<h2>What Other Streaming Services Have Workout Videos?</h2>

<p>There are several other streaming services that have a wider selection of workout videos than Netflix. Amazon Prime Video has a wide selection of workout videos, including instructional videos and full-length classes. Hulu also has a selection of workout videos, mostly focused on yoga and Pilates. YouTube is another great option for finding workout videos. You can find a variety of instructional videos, as well as full-length classes from top trainers.</p>

<h2>Do I Need to Subscribe to Multiple Streaming Services?</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for more variety in your workouts, then it might be worth subscribing to multiple streaming services. However, this can become expensive, as some streaming services can cost up to $15 a month. Before you subscribe to multiple streaming services, it’s important to consider how often you’ll be using them. If you’re only looking for occasional workouts, then it might be more cost-effective to rent or purchase individual workout videos.</p>

<h2>What Are Some Other Options for Finding Workout Videos?</h2>

<p>If you don’t want to subscribe to multiple streaming services, then there are other options for finding workout videos. You can rent or purchase individual workout videos from Amazon or iTunes. You can also find free workout videos on YouTube. If you’re looking for something more personalized, then you might want to consider a fitness app like Aaptiv or FitOn, which offer personalized workout plans and video classes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Netflix may not have a wide selection of workout videos, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t other options available. You can find a variety of workout videos on other streaming services like Amazon Prime, Hulu, and YouTube. You can also rent or purchase individual videos from Amazon or iTunes, or find free videos on YouTube. If you’re looking for something more personalized, then you might want to consider a fitness app like Aaptiv or FitOn.</p>
