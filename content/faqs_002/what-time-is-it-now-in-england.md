<p>England is a country steeped in history and culture, making it a popular tourist destination. The time in England, however, can be a bit confusing for some visitors, as there are a few things to consider when figuring out what time it is. This article will explain the basics of time in England, and help you figure out what time it is now in England.</p>

<p>The one exception to the UTC+0 rule is during the summer months. During the summer, England observes British Summer Time (BST), which is UTC +1. This means that during the summer months, the time in England is one hour ahead of the rest of the UTC+0 countries. It is important to note that BST does not apply to Ireland, as the Republic of Ireland is in the UTC+0 time zone year-round.</p>

During DST, the clocks are set one hour ahead of the standard time. This means that during DST, the time in England is two hours ahead of the rest of the UTC+0 countries.</p>

<p>It is important to note that while England observes DST, Scotland does not. This means that during the summer, Scotland is one hour ahead of England. However, during the winter months, Scotland is in the same time zone as England.</p>
