<p>Moonshine is a type of distilled spirit that is made illegally with the intention of avoiding taxes and regulations. It is made from various grains, such as corn, rye, and barley, and is traditionally produced in rural areas. It is often referred to as “white lightning” or “hooch” due to its high alcohol content. Moonshine is illegal to produce, transport, and sell in most countries, though it is still manufactured and consumed in certain parts of the world. So how much alcohol percent does moonshine actually contain?</p>

<h2>What Is Moonshine?</h2>
<p>Moonshine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermenting and distilling grains, such as corn, rye, and barley, and other fermentable sugars. It is usually produced in rural areas, as it is easier to hide the distillation process. It is generally referred to as “white lightning” or “hooch” due to its high alcohol content and its clandestine nature. Moonshine is illegal to produce, transport, and sell in most countries, though it is still manufactured and consumed in certain parts of the world.</p>

<h2>What Is the Alcohol Content of Moonshine?</h2> 
<p>The alcohol content of moonshine can vary greatly depending on the type of grain and the method of distillation. Generally, moonshine can range from as low as 25% alcohol by volume (ABV) to as high as 95% ABV. The strongest moonshine can be up to 190 proof, or 95% ABV, which is nearly twice as strong as the average bottle of vodka. The average moonshine, however, is typically around 40-50% ABV.</p>

<h2>How Is Moonshine Made?</h2>
<p>Moonshine is made by fermenting and distilling grains, such as corn, rye, and barley, and other fermentable sugars. The process starts by mashing the grains and boiling them to extract the sugars. The liquid is then cooled and fermented with yeast, which turns the sugars into alcohol. The alcohol is then distilled in order to increase the alcohol content and remove impurities. This process can take several days to complete.</p>

<h2>What Is the Difference Between Moonshine and Other Spirits?</h2>

This means that it can vary significantly in quality and alcohol content, and can even be dangerous to consume. It is also often produced in rural areas, where it can be difficult to track or regulate. Other spirits, such as whiskey and vodka, are produced legally and are subject to government regulations, meaning they are generally of a higher quality and more consistent alcohol content.</p>

<h2>What Is the Legal Status of Moonshine?</h2>
<p>Moonshine is illegal to produce, transport, and sell in most countries. In the United States, the federal government regulates the production and sale of alcohol, meaning moonshine is illegal. In some states, such as North Carolina, it is legal to produce limited amounts of moonshine for personal consumption. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, moonshine is illegal to produce and sell, but some forms may be legal for personal consumption.</p>
