<p>When you plan a trip, one of the most important packing considerations is the size of your luggage. Airlines have size restrictions on the bags that you can bring on board, and if you have oversized luggage, you may have to pay for an extra bag or check it in. To ensure that your luggage meets the airline restrictions, you need to understand what the linear inches measurements mean.</p>

<h2>What Are Linear Inches?</h2>

<p>Linear inches are the combined length and width of a bag. The measurement is determined by adding all of the external measurements of the bag. For example, if you have a bag that is 20 inches long, 15 inches wide and 10 inches deep, the linear inches of the bag will be 45 inches (20 + 15 + 10 = 45). The linear inches are the total of the length, width and depth of the bag.</p>

<h2>What Is The Maximum Linear Inches Allowed For Luggage?</h2>

<p>The maximum linear inches allowed for most airlines is 62 inches. This means that your luggage must not exceed a combined linear length of 62 inches. If you have a bag that is larger than 62 linear inches, you will not be able to carry it on board and will have to check it in. It is important to measure your bag before you travel to ensure that you are within the size restrictions.</p>

<h2>How To Measure Linear Inches?</h2>

<p>Measuring your bag for linear inches is simple. First, measure the length of the bag by placing a tape measure along the longest side. Then measure the width of the bag by placing a tape measure along the narrowest side. Finally, measure the depth of the bag by placing a tape measure along the side of the bag. Once you have all three measurements, add them together and you will have the total number of linear inches.</p>

<h2>Does The Linear Inches Measurement Include Wheels And Handles?</h2>

<p>No, the linear inches measurement does not include the wheels and handles. The measurement is only for the body of the bag and not for any additional parts such as wheels and handles.</p>

<h2>What If My Bag Is Larger Than 62 Linear Inches?</h2>

<p>If your bag is larger than 62 linear inches, you will need to check it in for your flight. Most airlines will have a fee for checking in oversized luggage, so it is important to measure your bag beforehand to ensure that you are within the size restrictions.</p>
