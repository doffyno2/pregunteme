Gatorade is one of the most popular sports drinks in the world and is considered one of the most effective hydration solutions for athletes. But who makes Gatorade and what goes into their iconic sports drink?

<h2>The History of Gatorade</h2>

Gatorade was invented in 1965 by a team of researchers at the University of Florida, who were looking for a way to help the school's football team stay hydrated during the hot, Florida summers. The team, led by Dr. Robert Cade, created a drink from a combination of water, salts, sugars, and lemon juice. The team called the drink “Gatorade” in honor of the University of Florida's football team, the Gators.
