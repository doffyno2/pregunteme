Coughing is a normal part of life. It's the body's way of ridding itself of irritants and foreign particles. But when a cough tastes like blood, it can be alarming. There could be a variety of causes, some of which may require medical attention. In this article, we'll discuss the potential causes of a cough that tastes like blood, as well as the treatment options available.

<h2>What Are the Causes of a Cough That Tastes Like Blood?</h2>

There are several potential causes of a cough that tastes like blood. The most common include:

Damage to the lungs or a lung disease can cause blood to seep into the airways and be expelled when coughing. This can cause a cough that tastes like blood. Lung conditions that can cause this include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and other forms of lung damage.

<h3>2. Upper Respiratory Infection</h3>

Upper respiratory infections such as the common cold or the flu can cause a cough that tastes like blood. This is because the infection causes irritation and inflammation of the airways, which can lead to bleeding.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that can cause a persistent cough that sometimes tastes like blood. TB is spread through the air and can cause severe damage to the lungs.

Lung cancer can cause a cough that tastes like blood. This is because tumors in the lungs can cause bleeding into the airways.
