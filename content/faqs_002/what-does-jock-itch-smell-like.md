<p>Jock itch is an irritating fungal infection that affects the groin area, including the inner thigh and buttocks. It's caused by a fungus called tinea cruris, which thrives in warm, moist environments. The telltale symptom of jock itch is an itchy, red rash with scaly patches. In some cases, the rash may turn into blisters or bumps. There may also be a noticeable odor associated with the rash, leading many to wonder what jock itch smells like.</p>

<h2>What Does Jock Itch Smell Like?</h2>

<p>In most cases, jock itch has a musty smell, similar to the smell of mold or mildew. This smell may become more intense if the fungal infection continues to spread and worsen. The odor is usually easy to detect and can linger in the air even after you have showered or changed clothes. If you experience a strong, unpleasant odor from the affected area, it's likely a sign that your jock itch is worsening.</p>

<h2>What Causes the Smell of Jock Itch?</h2>

<p>The musty odor associated with jock itch is caused by the fungus that is responsible for the infection. The fungus thrives in warm, moist environments, which is why it often develops in the groin area.
