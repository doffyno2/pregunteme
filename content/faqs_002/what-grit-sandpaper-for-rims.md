<p>When it comes to sanding down the rims of your car, you have to make sure you use the right grit sandpaper. Different grits of sandpaper are available and choosing the right one depends on the job you are doing. In this article, we will look at the different types of grit sandpaper and how to choose the best one for your needs.</p>

<h2>Types of Grit Sandpaper</h2>

<p>Grit sandpaper is available in a range of different grits, from very coarse to very fine. The coarser the grit, the more aggressive the sanding action. Coarse grit sandpaper is generally used for removing rust and paint from metal surfaces, while finer grits are used for polishing and finishing. The most commonly used grits for sanding rims are 120, 220, 320, 400 and 600.</p>

<h2>What Grit Sandpaper for Rims?</h2>

<p>When it comes to sanding down the rims of your car, the best type of grit sandpaper to use is 120 grit. This grit is coarse enough to remove any rust or paint, while still being gentle enough to avoid damaging the rim itself. For polishing and finishing the rims, you should use 400 or 600 grit sandpaper. This will give you a smooth, glossy finish without damaging the rim.</p>

<h2>Tips for Sanding Rims</h2>

<p>Before you start sanding, make sure you clean the rim thoroughly. Use a wire brush or a cloth to remove any dirt, dust and rust. Once the rim is clean, use a damp cloth and some soapy water to clean off any remaining dirt or debris. When sanding, use a circular motion and make sure to cover the entire surface of the rim.</p>

<p>When using the sandpaper, make sure you use light pressure. Too much pressure can cause the sandpaper to become clogged with debris, which can result in uneven sanding. Make sure to use the correct sandpaper for the job. Start with a coarser grit and move up to a finer one for polishing and finishing.</p>
