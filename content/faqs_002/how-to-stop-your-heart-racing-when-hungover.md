<h2>What Causes a Racing Heart When Hungover?</h2>

When it comes to hangovers, the physical and mental side effects can be a bit overwhelming. From nausea and headaches to confusion and dizziness, these after-effects are enough to make anyone feel uncomfortable. But one of the most common physical symptoms of a hangover is a racing heart.

So why does this happen? It all comes down to the way alcohol affects the body. When you’re hungover, your body is still trying to process and metabolize the alcohol you drank the night before. As your body works to break down the alcohol, its hormones become unbalanced and can result in a racing heart.

<h2>Risk Factors of Having a Racing Heart When Hungover</h2>

Although a racing heart is a common symptom of a hangover, there are certain factors that can increase your risk of having a racing heart when hungover. These factors include:

<ul>
  <li>Drinking too much alcohol</li>
  <li>Having a weakened immune system</li>
  <li>Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach</li>
  <li>Drinking alcohol with certain medications</li>
  <li>Drinking alcohol that is high in sugar or caffeine</li>
</ul>

If you’re prone to having a racing heart when hungover, it’s important to be aware of these risk factors and take steps to reduce your risk.
