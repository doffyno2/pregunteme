Broom covered hill is a term used to refer to a hill or mountain covered with a carpet of a yellowish-green flowering plant called broom, or in some cases, Scotch Broom. Broom is a common sight in the landscape of many countries, particularly in the Mediterranean region, where it is native. It is also found in many other parts of the world, including North and South America, Asia, and Australia.

Broom is a perennial shrub that grows to a height of up to five feet and produces clusters of yellow and orange flowers in the spring. The flowers of this plant have an intense fragrance and are often used in the making of perfumes. Broom is also used as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks, as well as in landscaping.

The term "broom covered hill" is often used to describe a hill or mountain that is covered with a thick layer of broom. This is usually seen in areas where the climate is warm and dry, such as in the Mediterranean region. Broom is a hardy plant and can withstand long periods of drought, making it ideal for dry, hilly, and mountainous areas.

Broom covered hills are often a source of great beauty, providing a picturesque backdrop to the surrounding landscape. The carpet of broom is also a great habitat for wildlife, providing food and shelter for birds, mammals, and insects. 

Broom is a fast-growing plant and can quickly take over an area if it is not kept in check. In some cases, broom can be invasive and can choke out native plants, making it important to monitor its growth and take action if necessary.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Broom Covered Hills?</h2>
Broom covered hills have a number of benefits, both for humans and for the environment. Here are just a few of the advantages that broom covered hills can bring:

<h3>Shelter for Wildlife</h3>

<h3>Beautiful Landscape</h3>
The carpet of broom provides a striking and beautiful backdrop to the surrounding landscape. This can make a great addition to any garden or park, and can be a great way to add a unique and eye-catching feature to the area.

<h3>Prevention of Erosion</h3>
