What is the Fastest Compound Bow on the Market?



Compound bows are a popular choice among archers because of their great accuracy and fast shooting speeds. But when you’re looking for the fastest compound bow on the market, you need to consider a few things. The draw weight, draw length, and axle-to-axle length of the bow all affect the speed and accuracy of your shots.

<h2>What You Need to Know About Compound Bow Speeds</h2>

When it comes to speed, compound bows are generally faster than traditional, recurve bows. But the speed of your shot also depends on the individual bow and its draw weight, draw length, and axle-to-axle length. Generally speaking, a longer draw length and lighter draw weight will result in a faster arrow speed. 

A compound bow with a longer axle-to-axle length will also shoot faster, as the bow will be able to store more energy. For example, a compound bow with an axle-to-axle length of 40 inches will shoot faster than a bow with an axle-to-axle length of 30 inches.
