<p>A blowout ear is a condition in which the eardrum ruptures due to an increase in pressure in the middle ear. It is a painful condition and can have long-term repercussions if not treated promptly. Fortunately, there are some signs and symptoms to watch for that can alert you to the presence of a blowout ear. In this article, we will look at how to tell if you have a blowout ear.</p>

<h2>Signs and Symptoms of a Blowout Ear</h2>

<p>The most common sign of a blowout ear is a sudden, sharp pain in the ear. This pain usually lasts only a few seconds but can be severe enough to cause dizziness and nausea. After the initial pain subsides, a feeling of fullness in the ear may remain. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, ringing in the ear, and fluid drainage from the ear. In some cases, an earache may be present.</p>

<p>If you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. Untreated blowouts can lead to long-term hearing loss, dizziness, and other complications.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis of a Blowout Ear</h2>

<p>Your doctor will perform a physical examination of your ear to determine if you have a blowout. This examination may include looking in the ear with an otoscope and/or measuring the air pressure in the ear with a manometer. If a blowout is suspected, your doctor may also order an imaging test such as an MRI or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Your doctor may also perform a visual inspection of the eardrum. If a tear is present, it can be seen on the eardrum and will look like a white line or a “flap”. In some cases, the tear may be too small to be seen on an examination. If this is the case, your doctor may recommend further testing.</p>

<h2>Treatment of a Blowout Ear</h2>

<p>The treatment for a blowout ear will depend on the severity of the tear. In most cases, a doctor will recommend that the patient wait a few days before returning to activities such as swimming or flying, as these activities can cause a further increase in pressure in the ear and make the tear worse. Your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics and/or a steroid to reduce inflammation and pain.</p>

<p>If the tear is large or persists, surgery may be necessary to repair the tear. This procedure is called a myringoplasty and involves placing a patch over the tear. This patch is usually made of a material such as Teflon or Gore-Tex and is sutured in place.</p>

<h2>Prevention of a Blowout Ear</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent a blowout ear is to avoid activities that can increase the pressure in the ear. These activities include swimming, flying, and diving. It is also important to avoid blowing your nose too hard and to use a decongestant spray if you have a cold or allergies.</p>

<p>In addition, it is important to have any ear infections treated promptly as this can lead to a blowout. If you experience any of the signs or symptoms of a blowout ear, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.</p>
