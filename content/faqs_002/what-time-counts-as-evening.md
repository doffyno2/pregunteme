When it comes to the question of what time counts as evening, the answer is not quite as straightforward as it may seem. The exact definition of “evening” varies depending upon the location, the season, and the context in which it is being used. In general, evening occurs after the sun has gone down and before the sun rises the following day.

<h2>What Is Evening in Astronomical Terms?</h2>

Nautical twilight, or the end of the nautical day, occurs when the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon. This usually happens about an hour after sunset.
