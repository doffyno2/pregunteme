<p>Coughing is a common reflex action that our bodies use to get rid of anything that has become lodged in our throats or airways. Coughing helps to clear out the irritants that can cause us discomfort. But sometimes, when we cough, we can taste something metallic. This can be a very strange and unpleasant sensation. But why does it happen?</p>

<h2>What Causes Metallic Taste?</h2>

<p>There are a number of possible causes of metallic taste. Some of the common causes include sinus infections, allergies, acid reflux, and certain medications.
