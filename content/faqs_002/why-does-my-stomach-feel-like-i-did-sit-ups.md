<p>Have you ever felt like you did a hundred sit-ups while you were sitting down? If so, you're not alone. Many people experience this strange sensation in their stomachs, and it can be quite uncomfortable. So what is going on and why does your stomach feel like you did sit-ups?</p>

<h2>What Causes This Sensation?</h2>

<p>This sensation is caused by a condition called diastasis recti, which is the separation of the left and right sides of the rectus abdominis muscle. This condition is common in pregnant women and after childbirth, when the abdominal muscles have to stretch to accommodate the growing baby. It can also occur in men and women who have had abdominal surgery or who have abdominal distension due to bloating or gas.</p>

<p>Diastasis recti can cause a protruding stomach and a feeling of heaviness in the abdomen. It can also cause a sensation of having done sit-ups even if you haven't. The sensation is caused by the tightening of the abdominal muscles when they are overstretched. This is because they are trying to compensate for the separation of the left and right sides of the muscle.</p>

<h2>How Can You Treat Diastasis Recti?</h2>

<p>If you have diastasis recti, you can treat it with physical therapy. Physical therapy can help to strengthen the abdominal muscles and reduce the separation of the left and right sides. It can also help to reduce the discomfort and pain associated with the condition. Your physical therapist can also recommend exercises to help strengthen the abdominal muscles, which can help to reduce the feeling of having done sit-ups.</p>

<p>It is important to note that if you have diastasis recti, you should not do any abdominal exercises that involve lifting or bending. These exercises can put extra strain on the abdominal muscles and make the separation worse. If you are pregnant or have recently given birth, it is best to wait until after you have had your baby before starting any physical therapy.</p>

<h2>When Should You See a Doctor?</h2>

<p>If you have diastasis recti and the sensation of having done sit-ups persists, it is important to see a doctor. A doctor can help to diagnose the condition and recommend the best course of treatment. They can also refer you to a physical therapist who can help to reduce the sensation and strengthen the abdominal muscles.</p>

<h2>How Can You Prevent Diastasis Recti?</h2>

<p>If you are pregnant or have recently given birth, it is important to do pelvic floor exercises and abdominal exercises that are safe and recommended by your doctor. These exercises can help to strengthen the abdominal muscles and reduce the chances of developing diastasis recti. It is also important to avoid doing any abdominal exercises that involve lifting or bending, as these can put extra strain on the abdominal muscles and make the separation worse.</p>
