<p>Scott Armstrong and Getty, the most popular conservative radio talk show hosts in the United States, have been hosting their show together since 1997. They are known for their edgy, often controversial topics and opinions, and their show has made them a household name. However, in February of 2021, Armstrong announced that he was leaving the show, leaving the future of the show in doubt.</p>

<p>So, what exactly happened to make Armstrong leave Armstrong and Getty? Let's take a look at the reasons behind his departure.</p>

<h2>Armstrong's New Venture</h2>

<p>The first and most obvious reason for Armstrong's departure from Armstrong and Getty is his new venture. Armstrong recently announced that he was launching a new podcast, The Armstrong and Getty Show, which will focus on political and social issues. The podcast is set to launch in May 2021, and it will be available to listen to on most major podcast networks.</p>

<p>The new podcast is likely to be a success, as Armstrong is well-known and respected within the conservative radio talk show circuit. It's also likely that the podcast will be more profitable than his radio show, as the podcast model allows for more direct monetization. Armstrong is likely to see a big return on his new venture.</p>

<h2>Differences in Opinion</h2>

<p>Armstrong and Getty have been known for their disagreements, and it's likely that their differences in opinion played a role in Armstrong's decision to leave the show. While the two hosts often agree on certain issues, they often disagree on others, and it's likely that these disagreements were becoming too much for Armstrong to handle.</p>

<p>Armstrong is a staunch conservative, while Getty is more moderate. This has led to some heated debates between the two hosts, and it's likely that these debates were becoming too much for Armstrong. By launching his own podcast, Armstrong will have more control over the topics he covers and the opinions he expresses.</p>

<h2>Burnout</h2>

<p>Another likely reason for Armstrong's departure is burnout. Armstrong and Getty have been hosting their show together since 1997, and it's likely that over the years, Armstrong has become increasingly tired of the grind. Hosting a radio show is a difficult job, and after 24 years, it's likely that Armstrong was feeling the strain.</p>

<p>By launching his own podcast, Armstrong will be able to have more control over his schedule and will likely feel less burned out. This will give him more time to focus on the topics he is passionate about and will likely lead to a better quality podcast.</p>

<h2>Armstrong and Getty's Future</h2>

<p>The future of Armstrong and Getty is uncertain. With Armstrong's departure, the show will likely see a decline in viewership, as Armstrong was a key part of the show. It's unclear who will replace Armstrong, but it's likely that the show will have to make some changes if it is to remain successful.</p>

<p>It's also unclear what will happen to The Armstrong and Getty Show. It's likely that the show will continue without Armstrong, but it's uncertain how successful it will be without him. Only time will tell.</p>
