<p>A PNR, or Passenger Name Record, is an essential component of any air travel reservation. It is a collection of information that is stored in a centralized database and is used to identify and track travelers and their bookings. In short, it is the “stamp” of an air ticket that helps you get your seat on the plane.</p>

<p>A PNR is created when a customer books a flight. The PNR includes the travel itinerary, contact details, payment information, and other necessary information that is needed for the booking. A PNR is unique to each customer and can be used to retrieve all relevant information for the customer's booking.</p>

<p>When a customer books a flight, the airline or travel agency sends a confirmation email with the PNR. This PNR is used to identify the customer's booking and can be used to retrieve the flight details or make changes to the booking. The customer can also use the PNR to check in for their flight and retrieve their boarding pass.</p>

<p>A PNR can also be used to store information about the customer's preferences, such as meal requests, seat preferences, special needs, and more. This information can then be used by the airline to provide a better customer experience. The PNR is also used by the airline to track the customer's journey and to provide customer service.</p>

<p>A PNR is also used by airlines to manage their inventory, as it helps them to know which flights are full and which ones might have available seats. This information helps them to adjust their fares accordingly and provide the best possible price for the customer.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Having a PNR?</h2>

<p>The PNR is a valuable tool for travelers and airlines alike. It provides a secure way to store and retrieve information about a customer's booking, allowing both parties to quickly access the necessary information. It also allows airlines to track the customer's journey, which can help them to provide better customer service.</p>

<p>A PNR can also help customers save time and money. For example, if a customer needs to make changes to their booking, they can easily do so using their PNR. This eliminates the need to contact the airline or travel agency to make the changes, and it can save the customer time and money.</p>
