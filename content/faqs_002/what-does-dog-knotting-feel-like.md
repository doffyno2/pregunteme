Dog knotting is a term used to describe the mating process between two dogs. It involves the male dog inserting his penis into the female dog's vagina, and then the male dog's penis swells, forming a knot. This knot is what helps to keep the two dogs together for the duration of the mating process.

It's important to note that this kind of activity is extremely natural and normal for dogs, and it's something that happens naturally as part of the mating process. But it can also be a source of worry for dog owners, especially those who are unfamiliar with the process. After all, it can be quite uncomfortable and even painful for the female dog if it's not done correctly. So if you're wondering what it feels like for your dog when they're knotting, we have the answers right here.
