<p>The average weight of an adult female in the United States is 166.2 pounds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A woman who weighs 180 pounds is considered to be significantly above the average weight range. There are many factors that can affect a woman's body shape and size, so it is difficult to pinpoint one particular look that all 180-pound women may share. However, there are some general characteristics to consider when discussing what a 180-pound woman may look like.</p>

<h2>Height to Weight Ratio</h2>

<p>The height to weight ratio is one of the most important factors to consider when determining what a 180-pound woman may look like. A woman who is 5 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds would have a body mass index (BMI) of 35. This is considered to be "severely obese" according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. A woman who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds would have a BMI of 27.5, which is considered to be "overweight." The higher the BMI, the more likely a woman is to carry extra weight in the form of body fat. It is important to note that BMI does not take into account muscle mass, so an athletic woman who weighs 180 pounds may appear to be at a healthy weight even though her BMI is above the ideal range.</p>

<h2>Body Type</h2>

<p>Another factor to consider when determining what a 180-pound woman may look like is her body type. There are three primary body types: ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph. Ectomorphs are typically thin and have difficulty gaining weight. Mesomorphs are naturally muscular and tend to have an athletic build. Endomorphs have a tendency to gain weight easily and have a softer, rounder shape. A woman's body type will influence her overall shape and size, so it is important to consider this when trying to determine what a 180-pound woman may look like.</p>

<h2>Clothing Size</h2>

<p>Clothing size is another factor to consider when determining what a 180-pound woman may look like. Clothing sizes vary greatly between brands and styles, so it is difficult to accurately predict what size a 180-pound woman would wear. Generally, a woman who weighs 180 pounds is likely to wear a size 14 or 16 in most standard clothing brands. However, due to the wide variety of sizes available, it is important to note that this is not a definitive answer.</p> 

<h2>Overall Look</h2>

<p>Overall, a 180-pound woman may have a variety of looks depending on her height, body type, and clothing size. In general, a woman who weighs 180 pounds is likely to be heavier than the average female, with a BMI that falls into the overweight or obese range. She may also have a fuller body shape, with some extra weight carried on her hips and thighs. Her clothing size may range from a size 12 to a size 16, depending on the brand and style.</p>
