Why is My Litter Robot Not Cycling?


Having a litter robot in your home is a great way to make sure your cats stay clean and healthy. However, many pet owners find that their litter robot isn't always working as it should. If you're having trouble with your litter robot not cycling, here are some possible causes and solutions.

<h2>What is a Litter Robot?</h2>

A Litter Robot is an automated litter box that uses a rotating drum to separate the clumps of litter from the clean litter. The clumps are then deposited into a waste drawer, and the clean litter is returned to the litter box. The Litter Robot is designed to make cleaning the litter box easier and more efficient.

<h2>Common Causes of a Litter Robot Not Cycling</h2>

There are a few common causes of a Litter Robot not cycling properly. The most common causes are:

<h3>1. Low Battery</h3>

The Litter Robot runs on battery power. If the battery is low, the Litter Robot may not be able to rotate the drum. Check the battery to make sure it is charged and replace it if necessary.

<h3>2. Clogged Waste Drawer</h3>

The waste drawer may become clogged with litter clumps or other debris. This can prevent the Litter Robot from cycling properly. Check the waste drawer to make sure it is clear and remove any debris.

<h3>3. Dirty Sensors</h3>

The Litter Robot is equipped with sensors that detect when the litter box needs to be emptied and when the drum needs to be rotated. If the sensors are dirty, they may not be able to detect when the litter box needs to be emptied or rotated. Clean the sensors using a damp cloth and make sure they are not blocked by debris.

<h3>4. Faulty Motor</h3>

The Litter Robot's motor may be faulty or worn out. If the motor is faulty, it may not be able to rotate the drum properly. Check the motor to make sure it is working properly and replace it if necessary.
