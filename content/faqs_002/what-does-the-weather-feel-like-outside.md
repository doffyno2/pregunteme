The weather outside is one of the great unknowns of life. It can be unpredictable and can drastically change in a matter of minutes. Whether you're planning a day outside, or just curious about what the weather is like, it's important to know what the weather feels like outside.

<h2>What is Weather?</h2>

Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a certain time and place. It is created by a variety of factors, including temperature, air pressure, wind speed, moisture, and clouds. All of these factors work together to create the weather we experience on a daily basis.

<h2>What Causes Weather?</h2>

Weather is caused by a combination of factors, including the sun, the Earth's rotation, and the movement of air and water. The sun's energy heats the air, which causes air pressure to change and wind to form. The Earth's rotation also causes weather, as the warm air in the tropics rises higher than the cold air in the poles. This creates different patterns of wind and weather around the world.
