<p>Air travel can be a stressful experience. We all want to make sure our flights are booked correctly and that our tickets are in order. But sometimes, our tickets can be in a state of limbo and show up as "pending." If you find yourself in this situation, you may be wondering why your American Airlines ticket is pending and what you can do to get it sorted out.</p>

<p>When you book a flight with American Airlines, you may see your ticket show up as "pending" in the booking system. This is because the ticket is not yet confirmed, and the airline is still processing the payment. Once the payment is processed, the ticket should move from pending to confirmed.</p>

<p>However, if after a few days your ticket still appears as pending, there may be a problem with the payment. This could be due to insufficient funds, a declined card, or an incorrect payment method. If this is the case, you should contact American Airlines directly to sort out the issue.</p>

<p>Another reason why your American Airlines ticket may be pending is if you have received a special fare. Special fares are fares that are offered at a lower rate than normal, but with certain restrictions. These fares must be approved by the airline before the ticket can be confirmed. This process can take up to 24 hours, so you should wait a few days before contacting the airline if your ticket is still pending.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you have booked a ticket with a discount code, your ticket may also be in a state of pending. Discount codes are a great way to save money on flights, but they can also cause issues when it comes to booking. Discount codes must be verified before the ticket can be confirmed, and this can take up to 24 hours.</p>

<h2>What to do if Your American Airlines Ticket is Pending</h2>

<p>If you find that your American Airlines ticket is pending, there are a few steps you can take to try and resolve the issue.</p>

<h3>Check Your Payment Method</h3>

<p>The first step is to check your payment method. Ensure that the payment method you used is valid and that there are sufficient funds available. If the payment method is incorrect or has insufficient funds, the ticket will remain in a pending state.</p>

<h3>Contact American Airlines</h3>

<p>If you have checked your payment method and it is valid, then you should contact American Airlines directly. The customer service team will be able to help you resolve any payment issues and ensure that your ticket is confirmed.</p>

<h3>Wait 24 Hours</h3>

<p>If you have received a special fare or used a discount code, then you should wait up to 24 hours before contacting the airline. This is because the airline may need to manually approve these fares or codes before the ticket can be confirmed.</p>
