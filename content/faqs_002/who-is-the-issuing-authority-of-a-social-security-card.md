<p>Social Security cards are one of the most important documents that citizens of the United States are issued. The cards are issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA), an independent agency of the United States government. They are responsible for issuing new Social Security cards, collecting taxes to fund the Social Security program, and managing the Social Security trust fund.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration has been issuing Social Security cards since 1936. The original Social Security card had the individual’s name, address, and Social Security number printed on it. Over the years, the card has changed to include additional information such as a photograph, signature, and birth date. Today, the Social Security card is used to prove a person’s identity and to receive benefits from the Social Security program.</p>

<p>In order to apply for a Social Security card, individuals must provide proof of their identity and citizenship. This can include documents such as a birth certificate, passport, or driver’s license. Individuals must also provide proof of their Social Security number, which can be obtained from the SSA. Once the identity and citizenship have been verified, the individual will receive a Social Security card in the mail.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration is the only organization authorized to issue new Social Security cards.
