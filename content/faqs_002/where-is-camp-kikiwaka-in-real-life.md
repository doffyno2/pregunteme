<p>Camp Kikiwaka is a fictional summer camp in Maine that is the setting of the popular Disney Channel television series, Bunk'd. Though the show takes place in a fictional location, many fans of the show have wondered where Camp Kikiwaka is in real life. Though the answer to that question isn't clear cut, there are some clues that can help us figure out the location of the camp.</p>

<h2>Where Was the Show Filmed?</h2>

<p>The first clue to the location of Camp Kikiwaka is the filming location of the show itself. Bunk'd was filmed at the former Camp Campbell in Santa Clarita, California, which is located about an hour north of Los Angeles. The camp served as the primary filming location for the show and was home to many of the iconic locations seen in the series, including the camp's main lodge, cabins, and the lake. While the camp is located in California, the show's writing staff made sure to give the show a more East Coast feel by adding elements to the show that were more characteristic of a Maine summer camp.</p>

<h2>The Camp's Fictional Location</h2>

<p>The next clue to the location of Camp Kikiwaka is the camp's fictional location. The camp is said to be located in Maine, which provides a bit more context to the show's setting. Maine is known for its wooded forests, rocky coasts, and charming small towns, all of which are seen throughout the series. Additionally, Maine is known for its abundance of summer camps, so the writers of Bunk'd were likely trying to capitalize on the state's well-known tourism appeal by making Camp Kikiwaka a part of it.</p>

<h2>Fictional Town of Moose Rump</h2>

<p>The show also mentions a fictional town called Moose Rump, which is located near Camp Kikiwaka. Though there is no real town called Moose Rump in Maine, the show's writers were likely inspired by the real-life town of Ogunquit, Maine, which is a popular tourist destination and home to many summer camps. Ogunquit is located on the southern coast of Maine and is known for its beautiful beaches and quaint downtown area. It's possible that the show's writers were trying to capture the feel of Ogunquit in Moose Rump, though it's also possible that they were simply using it as a reference point.</p>

<h2>The Mystery of Camp Kikiwaka</h2>

<p>Though the answer to the question of where Camp Kikiwaka is in real life isn't clear cut, there are some clues that can help us figure out the location of the camp. By looking at the filming location of the show, the camp's fictional location in Maine, and the fictional town of Moose Rump, it's possible to get a better sense of where Camp Kikiwaka might be located. Ultimately, however, the mystery of Camp Kikiwaka's true location remains unsolved.</p>
