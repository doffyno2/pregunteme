For men who are 5'11 in height, there is a wide variety of pant lengths to choose from. While some may find that a pair of trousers in a standard length are the perfect fit, others may be better suited to longer or shorter styles. In this article, we'll take a look at the different lengths available and how to choose the right pair for your body type.

<h2>Types of Pant Lengths</h2>

When shopping for pants, you'll typically find four different lengths: regular, short, long, and extra long. Regular length pants usually have an inseam of around 30 to 32 inches, which fits most people who are 5'11 in height. Short length pants have an inseam of 28 to 29 inches, and long length pants have an inseam of 33 to 34 inches. Extra long length pants have an inseam of 35 to 36 inches.

<h2>Choosing the Right Length</h2>

When it comes to choosing the right length of pants for a 5'11 man, the best option is to try them on and see how they fit. It's important to consider the rise of the pant, as well as the inseam, when determining the perfect fit. 

For instance, a pair of trousers with a lower rise may look better with a shorter inseam. Conversely, trousers with a higher rise may fit better with a longer inseam. Additionally, if you plan to wear the pants with a belt, you'll want to make sure the inseam is long enough so that the belt doesn't come out over the waistband. 

Finally, it's important to consider the fit of the pant leg. Ideally, the pant leg should fit snugly against the body without being too tight or too loose. If the pant leg is too tight, it may be uncomfortable to wear, while a pant leg that's too loose may make you look sloppy. 

<h2>Style Tips</h2>

When choosing a pair of pants for a 5'11 man, it's important to consider the style of the pant as well. For a more classic look, a pair of straight leg trousers is a great option. For a more contemporary look, slim fit or skinny fit trousers are a good choice. 

In addition, if you plan to wear the pants with a suit, it's important to choose a pair that's not too long or too short. A good rule of thumb is to make sure the pant leg breaks just above the shoe and doesn't cover the entire shoe.
