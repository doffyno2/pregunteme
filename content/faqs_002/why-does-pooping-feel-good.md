<p>It's a common misconception that going to the bathroom is just an unpleasant necessity. In reality, it can produce a sensation of relief and even pleasure. So why does pooping feel good?</p>

<h2>What Happens When You Go To The Bathroom?</h2>

As the stool moves through the rectal muscles, it creates a sensation of relief. When you actually pass the stool, you may experience a feeling of pleasure. This is due to the release of endorphins and other hormones. Endorphins are the body's natural painkillers, and they interact with the opioid receptors in your brain to create feelings of euphoria. When you go to the bathroom, your body releases endorphins that reduce stress and induce relaxation.</p>
