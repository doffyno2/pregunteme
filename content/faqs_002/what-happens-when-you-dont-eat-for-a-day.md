<p>Going without food for a day may seem like a simple task, but it can actually have a surprising impact on your body. Many people fast for religious or spiritual reasons, while others fast intermittently as part of their dieting routine. But what actually happens when you don’t eat for a day?</p>

<h2>Why People Fast</h2>

<p>Fasting is an ancient practice that has been used in many cultures for thousands of years. Some people fast for religious or spiritual reasons, while others may use fasting as a tool to help manage their weight. Fasting can also be used as a way to reset the body’s natural balance and to give the digestive system a break. Intermittent fasting, which is cycling between periods of eating and fasting, has become popular in recent years as a way to lose weight.</p>

<h2>What Happens When You Don't Eat for a Day?</h2>

<p>The effects of not eating for a day will vary from person to person, depending on their overall health and lifestyle. In general, people who fast for a day may experience:</p>

	<li>Headaches</li>

	<li>Sleepiness</li>
	<li>Irritability</li>
	<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
	<li>Low blood sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>In the short-term, not eating for a day may make you feel hungry, tired, and irritable. However, these symptoms should subside once you start eating again. In the longer-term, intermittent fasting may help to reduce your appetite, improve your metabolism, and reduce inflammation.</p>
