Texas is the second largest state in the United States, both by land area and population. It covers an area of 268,597 square miles, and is located in the south-central region of the United States. Texas is bordered by Mexico to the south, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. With this expansive area, it is no surprise that many people wonder how wide Texas is from east to west. 

<h2>Texas' East-West Boundaries</h2>

The Texas-Oklahoma border is the eastern edge of Texas' territory. This border stretches for 719 miles, extending from the Red River in the east to the Panhandle of Texas in the west. The Panhandle is the westernmost tip of Texas, and is located roughly in the center of the Texas-New Mexico border. This border extends for 579 miles, from El Paso in the west to the Sabine River in the east. Combined, Texas' east-west boundaries stretch for 1,298 miles. 

<h2>Texas' Average East-West Width</h2>

Texas' total east-west width is 1,298 miles. But its average east-west width is far less. This is because Texas is not a perfect rectangle, and it has a more irregular shape. It is narrower in some places, such as in the Panhandle, and wider in other places, such as in the south. The average east-west width of Texas is 645 miles. 

<h2>Texas' Widest Point</h2>

Texas' widest point is located in the south of the state, between Brownsville and El Paso. This stretch of land measures approximately 773 miles across. This makes it the widest stretch of land in the entire United States. 

<h2>Texas' Narrowest Point</h2>

Texas' narrowest point is located in the Panhandle. This stretch of land measures approximately 230 miles across. This is much narrower than Texas' widest point, and is still wider than the width of some entire states. 

<h2>The Difference Between Texas' East-West Width and North-South Width</h2>

The east-west width of Texas is significantly greater than its north-south width. This is because Texas is elongated from east to west, rather than from north to south. The north-south length of Texas is approximately 790 miles, making it significantly less than its east-west width. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Texas is an expansive state, and is one of the largest in the United States. Its east-west width is 1,298 miles, and its average east-west width is 645 miles. Its widest point is located in the south, between Brownsville and El Paso, and measures approximately 773 miles across. Its narrowest point is located in the Panhandle, and measures approximately 230 miles across. Texas' east-west width is significantly greater than its north-south width, which measures 790 miles.
