<p>When it comes to clothing, women's sizes and youth sizes are generally two different scales. To make matters even more confusing, there's no standard size that applies to both. Women's clothing sizes are based on body measurements and a standard of measurement, while youth sizes are based on age and height.</p>

<p>The simplest way to determine what size a woman wears in youth is to compare her measurements to those of a youth size chart. The measurements of a youth size chart are generally based on age and height, and can be found online. To get the most accurate sizing, it's best to use a size chart that is specific to the brand or clothing line.</p>

<p>When looking at a size chart, it's important to note that the measurements may vary slightly from one brand to another. For instance, a women's size 8 in one brand may be a size 6 in another. Additionally, some brands will use numbers to indicate sizes, while others use letters, such as XS, S, M, L, or XL.</p>

<p>To determine what size a woman wears in youth, it's important to measure her body. This can be done easily with a flexible measuring tape. Measure her chest, waist, and hips in inches, and compare the measurements to those of the size chart. It's important to note that the same size may not fit differently in different brands, so it's best to take measurements for each item of clothing.</p>

<p>When shopping for youth clothing, it's important to remember that sizes can vary from one brand to another. It's best to measure the child and compare the measurements to those of the size chart. If the child is in between sizes, it's best to size up rather than size down, as clothing that is too tight can be uncomfortable.</p>

<p>For those who are unsure of what size to buy for a woman in youth, it's best to take her measurements and compare them to those of the size chart. It's also important to remember that sizes can vary from one brand to another, so it's best to measure the woman and compare her measurements to those of the size chart.</p>
