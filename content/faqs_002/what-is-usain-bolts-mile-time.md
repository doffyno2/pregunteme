Usain Bolt is arguably the greatest sprinter in history and he achieved his success by being the fastest man in the world over short distances. But what is Usain Bolt's mile time? 

<p>Usain Bolt is known for his incredible speed over short distances, and he holds the world records for the 100m and 200m sprints. His best time for the 100m is an astonishing 9.58 seconds, and his best time for the 200m is 19.19 seconds. As a result, he is often considered the fastest man in the world.</p>

<p>But what if we wanted to know Usain Bolt's mile time? After all, the mile is a much longer distance than the sprints he is best known for. It stands to reason that he would not be as fast over this longer distance, but is there any record of his mile time?</p>
