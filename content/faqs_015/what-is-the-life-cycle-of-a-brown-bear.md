<p>Brown bears are the largest of the bear species, and they can be found in a variety of habitats across the northern hemisphere. They are known for their strength, intelligence, and generally solitary lifestyle. As majestic as they may be, a brown bear's life cycle is not always easy. From birth to death, it is a difficult and sometimes dangerous journey.</p>

<h2>Birth and Early Development</h2>

<p>Brown bears usually give birth in January or February to a litter of one to four cubs. The cubs are born blind and helpless, weighing only a few ounces each. The mother brown bear will care for the cubs for the first two years of their life, teaching them the skills they need to survive in the wild. During this time, the cubs learn how to hunt, forage for food, and recognize danger. The cubs also develop a strong bond with their mother, which will help them as they mature.</p>

<h2>Juvenile Stage</h2>

<p>At around two years of age, the brown bear cubs will leave their mother to venture out on their own. During this juvenile stage, the young bears will explore their environment and hone their survival skills. After a few months of exploring, the bears will settle into an area and begin to establish a territory. This territory will be the bear's home for most of its life.</p>

<h2>Adulthood</h2>

<p>At around four years of age, the brown bear will reach maturity and begin to breed. The female bear will usually have a litter of cubs every two to three years. The male bear will also establish a territory and spend much of his time either mating or defending his territory from intruders. Adult brown bears can live up to 30 years in the wild.</p>

<h2>Old Age and Death</h2>

<p>As the brown bear ages, it will become less active and may spend more time in its den. Eventually, the bear will become too weak or ill to survive and will die of natural causes. Brown bears have a life expectancy of around 20 years in the wild.</p>
