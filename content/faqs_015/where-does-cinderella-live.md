Cinderella is a beloved and iconic character in fairy tales and literature around the world. But the question remains - where does Cinderella live? 

Since the earliest versions of the story of Cinderella, the setting of the story has been vague. In some versions, the location is a kingdom; in some, it is a city; and in some, it is a village. In all cases, however, the setting of the story is not specified. 

<h2>Cinderella's Home in Different Versions of the Story</h2>

In the earliest version of the story, Cinderella's home is never named. This version, written by Giambattista Basile and published in 1634, takes place in an unspecified kingdom. 

The version of the story written by Charles Perrault in 1697, which is the most well-known version, also takes place in an unnamed kingdom. This version of the story is set in a city, though it is never specified which one.

The Brothers Grimm's version of the story, published in 1812, also takes place in an unspecified kingdom. However, this version of the story is set in a small, rural village rather than a city. 

<h2>The Setting of Disney's Cinderella</h2>

Disney's version of the Cinderella story, released in 1950, takes place in a fictional kingdom called "the kingdom of the court". This kingdom is implied to be somewhere in Europe, based on the architecture and costumes featured in the movie. 

<h2>The Setting of Other Adaptations</h2>

Other adaptations of the Cinderella story, such as the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical released in 1957, take place in unspecified kingdoms. The setting of the 1997 live-action adaptation of the story is also unspecified. 

<h2>The Real Location of Cinderella's Home</h2>

The real location of Cinderella's home is a matter of debate. Some scholars believe that the story was inspired by stories from several European countries, including France, Italy, and Germany. Others believe that the story was inspired by stories from China and India. 

<h2>The Symbolism of Cinderella's Home</h2>

Regardless of the real location of Cinderella's home, the setting of the story is often seen as symbolic. The kingdom or village in which the story takes place is often seen as a representation of the world in which the main character lives. The kingdom or village is often seen as a place of oppression and hardship, from which Cinderella must escape in order to find happiness. 

<h2>The Moral of the Story</h2>

The moral of the Cinderella story is often seen as a lesson in perseverance and resilience. Despite the hardships she faces, Cinderella never gives up hope. She eventually finds her happily ever after, proving that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.
