Are Bala Sharks Freshwater Fish?

Are Bala Sharks freshwater fish? This is a question that many people have when they are looking to add a fish to their aquarium. Bala Sharks, also known as Silver Sharks or Tricolor Sharks, are a popular species of fish that can be found in both freshwater and brackish water, but they are not considered true freshwater fish. In this article, we will explore the care requirements, diet, and natural habitat of Bala Sharks, as well as whether or not they can be kept in a freshwater tank.

What Are Bala Sharks?

Bala Sharks, or Balantiocheilos melanopterus, are a species of fish native to Southeast Asia. They are a member of the Cyprinidae family, which includes carp, barbs, and other similar species. Bala Sharks are one of the larger species of the Cyprinidae family, reaching up to 18 inches in length. They have silvery-white bodies with black stripes and fins, earning them the nickname “Silver Sharks”. They are a popular species of aquarium fish, but they are not true freshwater fish and require a brackish environment to thrive.

Are Bala Sharks Freshwater Fish?

No, Bala Sharks are not considered true freshwater fish. They are actually a species of brackish water fish, which means they require a slightly salty environment in order to thrive. In the wild, Bala Sharks live in slow-moving rivers and estuaries, where the water has a slightly higher salinity than typical freshwater. This is important to remember when setting up a tank for Bala Sharks, as they need a brackish environment to be healthy and happy.

What Is a Brackish Aquarium?

A brackish aquarium is an aquarium that has a higher salinity than a typical freshwater aquarium. This is achieved by adding marine salt to the water. The exact salinity will depend on the species of fish you are keeping, as different fish require different levels of salinity. Generally, a brackish aquarium should have a specific gravity between 1.005 and 1.015.

What Are the Care Requirements for Bala Sharks?

Bala Sharks are relatively easy to care for, but they do require a special aquarium setup in order to thrive. They need an aquarium that is at least 75 gallons in size, with plenty of hiding places and open swimming space. The water should have a specific gravity between 1.005 and 1.015, and it should be kept at a temperature between 75 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. They should be fed a variety of meaty foods, such as shrimp, worms, and bloodworms.

What Is the Natural Habitat of Bala Sharks?

Bala Sharks are native to Southeast Asia, where they inhabit slow-moving rivers and estuaries. In the wild, they live in a slightly salty environment with a specific gravity between 1.005 and 1.015. They prefer shallow, slow-moving waters with plenty of vegetation and hiding places.
