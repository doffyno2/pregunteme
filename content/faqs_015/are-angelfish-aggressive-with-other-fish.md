<p>Angelfish are a type of cichlid fish native to South America. They are an incredibly popular species of fish, prized for their vibrant colors, peaceful nature and easy adaptability to a variety of tank conditions. However, many aquarists are concerned about their potential for aggression towards other fish. In this article, we'll discuss whether or not angelfish are aggressive with other fish, what you can do to reduce the risk of aggression, and how to create the ideal environment for angelfish to thrive.</p>

<h2>Do Angelfish Show Aggressive Behavior?</h2>

<p>Angelfish are generally peaceful fish and are not normally aggressive towards other fish. However, they can sometimes display territorial behavior, especially when defending their eggs or fry. When this happens, angelfish may become aggressive towards other fish in the tank, chasing them and nipping at their fins. This is generally not a problem in tanks with plenty of hiding places and plenty of room for the fish to swim around. However, in smaller tanks or overcrowded tanks, angelfish may become more aggressive and may even attack other fish.</p>

<h2>What Can You Do To Reduce Aggression?</h2>

<p>In order to reduce the risk of aggression, it is important to provide angelfish with plenty of space and hiding places. If possible, use a tank that is at least 30 gallons in size, as this will provide enough room for angelfish to swim around without feeling cramped. Additionally, adding plenty of plants and rocks to the tank will help provide hiding places for the fish. Finally, it is important to make sure that the tank is not overcrowded, as this can lead to aggression.</p>

<h2>Creating The Ideal Environment</h2>

<p>In addition to providing plenty of space and hiding places, there are a few other things you can do to create an ideal environment for angelfish. First, angelfish prefer soft, slightly acidic water, so it is important to make sure the tank's water parameters are in the ideal range. Additionally, angelfish prefer low light levels, so it is important to make sure the tank is not too bright. Angelfish also prefer a variety of food, so it is important to provide them with a varied diet. Finally, angelfish should be kept in groups of at least three or four, as this will help reduce aggression and ensure that the fish are happy and healthy.</p>
