What Size Tubing for Brake Bleeding?


When it comes to car maintenance, many drivers don’t perform routine brake checks. This can lead to bigger issues down the road, as brake issues left unchecked can cause costly repairs. One of the most important steps in ensuring your brakes are in good working condition is to change the brake fluid. This involves draining the existing fluid and then refilling with fresh fluid. But what size tubing do you need for brake bleeding?

<h2>Understanding the Basics of Brake Fluid</h2>

Before we answer the question of what size tubing for brake bleeding, it’s important to understand a few basics about brake fluid. Brake fluid is a type of hydraulic fluid that is used to operate the brakes.
