A fire road is a type of unpaved road that is used by firefighting personnel to access remote areas of forests, parks, and other rural locations. Fire roads are typically wide, with a flat surface that is easy to traverse with vehicles and equipment. Fire roads are often located in areas that are not accessible by traditional paved roads, such as steep inclines or deep ravines. Fire roads may also be used as access points for recreational activities, such as hiking, biking, and camping.

The primary purpose of fire roads is to provide access to remote areas of forests and parks for firefighting personnel. This access allows firefighters to respond quickly to wildfires, as well as to other emergency situations.
