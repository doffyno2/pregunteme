<p>The newest country in the world is South Sudan, which declared independence from Sudan on July 9th, 2011. It is the world's 193rd country and Africa's 54th sovereign state. South Sudan is located in the northeastern part of the continent, bordered by Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.</p>

<p>South Sudan is the world's youngest nation. The country has a population of around 12 million and is comprised of over 60 different ethnic groups. South Sudanese are mainly Christian, but there are also practitioners of traditional African religions and a small number of Muslims. English is the official language, but there are numerous local dialects spoken throughout the country.</p>

<p>The Republic of South Sudan is divided into ten states, with the capital city of Juba located in Central Equatoria State. The nation is rich in natural resources, including oil, minerals, and wildlife. It is also home to a number of protected areas, such as Boma National Park, which is home to the endangered white-eared kob. Agriculture is the primary economic activity, with cotton and sorghum being among the most important crops.</p>

<p>South Sudan is still in the process of forming its government and establishing its infrastructure. In recent years, the country has been plagued by civil war and unrest, largely due to tribal conflicts between the Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups. The United Nations has provided assistance to the country, helping to support its peace process and ensure its stability.</p>

<h2>What is the History of South Sudan?</h2>

<p>The area which is now South Sudan was originally part of the Kingdom of Kush, which was an ancient African empire that existed in what is now Sudan and South Sudan. From 1820 to 1885, the area was part of the Ottoman Empire, and later part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The region was then annexed by the British Empire in 1899, becoming part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.</p>

<p>The region experienced a long period of civil war and violence during the 1950s and 1960s, as the South Sudanese fought for autonomy from the central government in Khartoum. This eventually culminated in the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, which granted South Sudan autonomy from Sudan and allowed it to become an independent nation in 2011. Since then, South Sudan has continued to struggle with civil unrest and political instability.</p>

<h2>What are the Political Structures of South Sudan?</h2>

The government of South Sudan is also responsible for providing social services, such as healthcare and education, to its citizens.</p>
