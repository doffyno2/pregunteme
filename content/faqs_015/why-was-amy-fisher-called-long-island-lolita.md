<p>In 1992, Amy Fisher became a household name after she was arrested and charged with shooting the wife of her lover, Joey Buttafuoco. Due to her age, notoriety, and background, the media referred to her as the “Long Island Lolita.” It was a nickname that would follow her for decades and become part of the American lexicon.</p>

<p>Fisher was born in Merrick, Long Island in 1974. She was the second of three children, born to Elliot and Roseann Fisher. Her father worked in a car dealership and her mother was a nurse. The Fishers were a fairly typical middle-class family, living in a modest home on a quiet street.</p>

<p>When Amy was 16, she started a relationship with Joey Buttafuoco, a married man who was nearly twice her age. The couple started an affair, which eventually led to Fisher’s shooting of Buttafuoco’s wife, Mary Jo Buttafuoco. The attack left Mary Jo with severe facial injuries. Fisher was later arrested and charged with attempted murder.</p>

<p>The story gained nationwide attention, due in part to Fisher’s age, her relationship with Buttafuoco, and the severity of the attack. It quickly became a media circus, with the New York tabloids referring to Fisher as the “Long Island Lolita.” The nickname was a reference to the novel Lolita, which tells the story of an older man’s sexual relationship with a much younger girl. While the phrase was meant to be derogatory, Fisher embraced it and even used it as the title of her autobiography.</p>

<p>Fisher eventually pleaded guilty to first-degree assault and served seven years in prison. After her release, she went on to become a talk-show host, an actress, and a singer. She also wrote a book and appeared on several reality TV shows. Her notoriety has allowed her to capitalize on her “Lolita” nickname and become an unlikely celebrity.</p>
