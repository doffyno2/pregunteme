<p>The Great Outdoors is a classic comedy film that has been beloved by fans since its release in 1988. The film stars John Candy, Dan Aykroyd, and Annette Bening as the bumbling, would-be outdoorsmen who try to make the best of a camping trip gone awry. It's a timeless classic that never gets old, and is often referenced in other movies and TV shows.</p>

<p>But where was the film actually filmed? It turns out, the answer isn't as simple as you might think. While the movie was set in the fictional town of Walley, Wisconsin, the majority of the filming was done in California. The main location for the film was the Yosemite National Park in California, and the scenes of the family camping in the woods were shot in the nearby Sequoia National Park.</p>

<p>The opening scene of the film features the family driving up to the campground, and this was shot on the Big Tujunga Canyon Road in Los Angeles. The exterior shots of the family's house were done at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. The exterior of the restaurant where John Candy's character, Chet Ripley, works was filmed at the historic Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale. And the famous scene where Chet and Roman Craig (Dan Aykroyd) are fighting in the lake was filmed at Bass Lake, in the Sierra National Forest.</p>

<h2>Why Was The Great Outdoors Filmed in California?</h2>

<p>The Great Outdoors was written and directed by John Hughes, who was known for his work on classic comedies such as National Lampoon's Vacation, Home Alone, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Hughes wanted to make a movie that was set in the Midwest, but he decided that it would be more cost-effective to film in California.</p>

<p>At the time, filming in Los Angeles was much cheaper than filming in the Midwest. Hughes also wanted to take advantage of the beautiful scenery of California, which made the movie look much more authentic. In addition, he was able to hire local actors and crew members, which saved money and time.</p>
