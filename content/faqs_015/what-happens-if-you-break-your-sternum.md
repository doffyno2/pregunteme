<p>A sternum fracture, also referred to as a ‘broken sternum’, is a break in the breastbone, the bone that runs down the middle of the chest. The sternum is made up of three parts – the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. It can fracture in any of these areas and can be caused by a blunt force, such as a car accident or a fall, or by a sharp force, such as a stab wound. In some cases, a broken sternum can also occur without an obvious cause.</p>

<h2>What Are the Symptoms of a Broken Sternum?</h2>

<p>The most common symptom of a broken sternum is pain in the chest area. The pain may be sharp or dull and may worsen when you press on the affected part of the sternum. Other symptoms may include bruising, swelling, and tenderness in the chest area, as well as difficulty breathing.</p>

<h2>How Is a Broken Sternum Diagnosed?</h2>

<p>If you experience any of the above symptoms, you should seek medical attention. Your doctor will examine your chest and may order a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the severity of the fracture, they may also order a CT scan or MRI to determine the extent of the injury.</p>

<h2>What Are the Treatment Options for a Broken Sternum?</h2>

<p>The treatment for a broken sternum will depend on the severity of the fracture. Most sternum fractures can be treated without surgery. Your doctor may recommend rest and pain medications to reduce your discomfort. They may also suggest wearing a wrap around your chest to provide extra support and prevent further injury. In more severe cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair the fracture.</p>

<h2>What Is the Recovery Time for a Broken Sternum?</h2>

<p>The recovery time for a broken sternum will vary depending on the severity of the injury. For mild fractures, you may be able to return to your normal activities within a few weeks. For more severe fractures, recovery may take several months. During this time, you should avoid strenuous activities, such as lifting heavy objects, to prevent further injury.</p>

<h2>What Complications Can Occur From a Broken Sternum?</h2>

<p>Complications from a broken sternum can include an increased risk of developing pneumonia or a lung infection. In some cases, the fracture can cause damage to the nearby ribs, lungs, and other organs. If the fracture is severe, it can also cause nerve damage, which can result in chronic pain.</p>
