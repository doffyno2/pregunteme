<p>Arrow is a popular superhero series that has gained immense popularity in recent years. Oliver Queen, the show's protagonist, is known for his use of a bow and arrow in order to fight crime. So, what kind of bow does Arrow use?</p>

<h2>Overview of Arrow's Bow</h2>

<p>The bow used by Oliver Queen in the Arrow television show is a recurve bow. A recurve bow is a type of bow that is characterized by its curved limbs that help increase the speed and power of the arrow. The bow used in the show is a compound bow, meaning it is made up of multiple pieces that are attached together to form a single unit. The bow has a draw weight of approximately 70 pounds, giving it enough power to pierce steel and other hard targets. The bow also has a draw length of 28 inches, which is considered ideal for most archers. The bow is also equipped with a sight, which helps the user aim more accurately.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of a Compound Bow</h2>

<p>Compound bows are known for being able to shoot arrows at a faster velocity and more accuracy than traditional bows. This makes them ideal for hunting and target shooting. Compound bows also have adjustable draw weights, which makes them suitable for a wide range of archers. This allows the user to adjust the draw weight to match their strength and skill level.</p>

<p>Compound bows are also more accurate than traditional bows due to the addition of a sight. This helps the user to aim more accurately and increases the chance of hitting the target. The addition of the sight also makes it easier to shoot in low light conditions, as the sight provides a clear reference point for the archer.</p>

<h2>Drawbacks of a Compound Bow</h2>

<p>Although compound bows are known for their increased accuracy and power, they do have some drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that they are heavier than traditional bows, making them more difficult to carry. Compound bows also require more maintenance than traditional bows due to the complexity of the design.</p>

<p>Compound bows are also more expensive than traditional bows, as they require more parts to construct and are more complex. This increased expense can be a deterrent for some people who are just starting out with archery.</p>

<h2>What Arrows Does Arrow Use?</h2>

<p>In the Arrow television show, Oliver Queen uses carbon fiber arrows. Carbon fiber arrows are known for their durability, strength, and accuracy. They are also lightweight and can travel at a faster velocity than heavier arrows. Carbon fiber arrows also have a better aerodynamic profile, which makes them more accurate in flight.</p>

<p>The arrows used by Oliver Queen are also equipped with special heads that are designed to penetrate steel and other hard targets. These heads are designed to cause maximum damage and increase the effectiveness of the arrow.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
