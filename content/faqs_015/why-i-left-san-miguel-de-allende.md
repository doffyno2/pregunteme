San Miguel de Allende is a beautiful city located in the state of Guanajuato in Central Mexico. It's known for its colonial architecture, vibrant culture, and stunning mountain views. I lived there for two years, and while I enjoyed my time in the city, I eventually decided to move on for a number of reasons.

<h2>The Cost of Living Was High</h2>

San Miguel de Allende is a popular destination for tourists and expats alike, and unfortunately, the cost of living in the city reflects that popularity. The cost of housing, food, and other necessities is significantly higher than in other parts of Mexico. This was especially difficult for me because I was living on a budget and trying to save money.

<h2>The Crowds Were Overwhelming</h2>

San Miguel de Allende is a popular tourist destination, and during certain times of the year, the city is overrun with tourists. This made it difficult to enjoy the city in peace and quiet. The streets were often filled with people, the restaurants were always packed, and the shops were constantly crowded. It was difficult to find a moment of peace and quiet.

<h2>The Weather Was Too Hot</h2>

San Miguel de Allende is located in the desert, and the summers are often unbearably hot. The temperature often climbs well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the humidity makes it even worse. I found it difficult to enjoy the city in such extreme heat.

<h2>The Infrastructure Is Poor</h2>

San Miguel de Allende is a small city, and its infrastructure is not up to par with larger cities in Mexico. The roads are often in disrepair, the public transportation is unreliable, and the internet can be spotty at times. It was difficult to get around the city and access the services I needed.

<h2>The Healthcare Is Subpar</h2>

The healthcare in San Miguel de Allende is far below what I would have expected from a city of its size. The hospitals are often crowded and understaffed, and many of the doctors and nurses do not speak English. This made it difficult to access the medical care I needed.

<h2>The Nightlife Was Not to My Liking</h2>

San Miguel de Allende is known for its lively nightlife, but I found it to be too loud and crowded for my tastes. The bars were often filled with tourists, and the music was often too loud. This made it difficult to find enjoyable places to spend my evenings.

<h2>The Language Barrier Was Frustrating</h2>

While many people in San Miguel de Allende do speak some English, it was still difficult to communicate due to the language barrier. This made it difficult to access services and get the help I needed.

<h2>The Pollution Was Unbearable</h2>

San Miguel de Allende has a serious problem with air pollution. The city is surrounded by factories and power plants, and the air quality is often very poor. This made it difficult to enjoy the city in comfort and without fear of health issues related to air pollution.
