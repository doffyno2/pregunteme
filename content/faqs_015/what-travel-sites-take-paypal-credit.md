<p>Traveling can be an exciting, but expensive, endeavor. Thankfully, there are now a variety of payment options available to help make the cost of travel more manageable. One of the most popular payment options is PayPal Credit, which allows you to purchase items and services online, with no interest for up to six months. So, if you're planning a trip, you may be wondering what travel sites take PayPal Credit?</p>
