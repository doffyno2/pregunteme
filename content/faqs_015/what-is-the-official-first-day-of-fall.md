<p>Fall is the season of the year when temperatures begin to drop, the leaves change color, and the days get shorter. Every year, the official first day of fall is marked by the autumnal equinox, when the Sun is directly above the equator and day and night are of nearly equal length all over the world. </p>


<h2>What is the Autumnal Equinox?</h2>

<p>The autumnal equinox is one of two times during the year when the Sun is directly above the equator. The other time is during the vernal equinox, which marks the beginning of spring.
