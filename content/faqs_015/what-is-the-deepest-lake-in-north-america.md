<p>North America is home to some of the deepest and most impressive lakes in the world. Many of these lakes are renowned for their beauty and depth, but one stands out as the deepest of them all. The deepest lake in North America is Lake Baikal in Russia, with a maximum depth of 5,387 feet (1,642 meters).</p>

<h2>What Makes Lake Baikal So Deep?</h2>

<p>The primary reason for Lake Baikal's extreme depth is its location in a rift valley, caused by the movements of the Earth's tectonic plates. The rift valley is so deep that it reaches the Earth's mantle, causing the lake to become incredibly deep over time. The rift valley is also very long, allowing for a large area of the lake to reach its maximum depth.</p>
