The Empire Strikes Back is the iconic second installment of the original Star Wars trilogy. It is one of the most beloved films of all time, and a major part of its success is attributed to its iconic characters, vehicles and settings. One of the most memorable pieces of equipment from the movie is the vehicle Luke Skywalker used to escape from the surface of the ice planet Hoth. So what's Luke riding in The Empire Strikes Back?

<h2>Luke's T-47 Airspeeder</h2>

The Empire Strikes Back features an array of vehicles, but the one that Luke used to escape from the ice planet Hoth is known as a T-47 Airspeeder. It's a two-person airspeeder that was used by the Rebel Alliance to travel through the air over long distances. The T-47 is a repulsorcraft, meaning it uses repulsorlifts to stay afloat. It's powered by an ion engine, which allows it to reach high speeds.

The T-47 Airspeeder is armed with two laser cannons and a concussion missile launcher. It also has a deflector shield that can be used to protect it from enemy fire. The T-47 is also equipped with a hyperdrive, allowing it to travel through hyperspace.
