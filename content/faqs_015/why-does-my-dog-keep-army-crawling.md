Most dog owners will have come across the term ‘army crawling’ at some point or another, but may not be sure what it means. Army crawling is when a dog moves around on their stomach and paws, instead of running or walking. There are a number of reasons why a dog may resort to army crawling, and it’s important to get to the bottom of it in order to ensure your dog’s health and wellbeing.
