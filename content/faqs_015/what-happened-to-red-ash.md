Red Ash is a video game franchise that was created and developed by Comcept, a Japanese video game studio founded by Keiji Inafune. The original game, Red Ash: The Indelible Legend, was released in 2015 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game was critically acclaimed for its unique art style, interesting narrative, and expansive world.

However, the game was not a commercial success, and Comcept struggled to get the sequel, Red Ash: Magicicada, off the ground. In 2017, the studio announced a crowdfunding campaign for the game, but it failed to reach its goal. Despite the disappointment, Comcept was able to secure a partnership with Chinese publisher Fuze Entertainment to bring Red Ash: Magicicada to life.

The surviving humans live in a city known as Zebulos, which is protected by a powerful energy shield.

The player takes on the role of Beck, a young man who is searching for the legendary weapon known as the Red Ash.
