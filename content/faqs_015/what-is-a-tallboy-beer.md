<p>Tallboy beer is a type of beer that is served in a taller and wider can than the standard 12-ounce can.

Tallboy beers are generally found in craft beer and microbreweries, with more and more breweries adopting the tallboy can for their products.</p>

<h2>Why is a Tallboy Beer Called a Tallboy?</h2>
