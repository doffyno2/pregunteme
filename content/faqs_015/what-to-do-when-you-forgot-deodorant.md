<p>Nobody likes to be in a situation where they forget to put on deodorant and end up having to deal with an unpleasant body odor. It can be embarrassing and uncomfortable, and you may feel like you have no option but to suffer through the day. But there are actually a few tricks you can try to help you out of this dilemma.</p>

<p>The first, and most obvious, solution is to head to the nearest store and purchase a new deodorant. This will be the quickest, and most effective, way to deal with your odor problem. But if you don't have the time or money to go out and buy a new deodorant, there are still a few things you can do.</p>

<h2>1. Use Baby Wipes</h2>

<p>Baby wipes can be a great way to quickly freshen up and get rid of any odor. Simply take a baby wipe and wipe it over your armpits. This will help to remove any sweat and bacteria, reducing the odor. If you don't have baby wipes, any kind of wet wipe will work â€“ just make sure it's unscented.</p>

<h2>2. Use Baking Soda</h2>

<p>Baking soda is a natural deodorizer and can be used to help reduce body odor. Simply sprinkle some baking soda into your armpits and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing off. The baking soda will help to absorb any sweat and bacteria, reducing the odor.</p>

<h2>3. Wear Antiperspirant</h2>

<p>Antiperspirant is designed to help reduce sweat and keep you smelling fresh. Applying antiperspirant to your armpits will help to reduce sweat and bacteria, decreasing the odor. Make sure to use an antiperspirant that is specifically designed for use on the body, as some antiperspirants can irritate the skin.</p>

<h2>4. Wear Loose-Fitting Clothing</h2>

<p>Wearing loose-fitting clothing can help to reduce body odor. Tight-fitting clothing can trap in sweat and bacteria, leading to an increase in body odor. Wearing loose-fitting clothing will help to keep your skin dry and reduce the amount of sweat produced, helping to keep you smelling fresh.</p>

<h2>5. Change Your Diet</h2>

<p>Your diet can also have an effect on body odor. Certain foods, such as garlic, can make body odor worse. Eating a balanced diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables, will help to keep your body odor under control.</p>
