<p>Knees are a very important part of the body. They are a complex joint that allows us to move our legs in many directions. Unfortunately, many people suffer from knee pain or discomfort. The most common cause of knee pain is arthritis or another degenerative joint disorder. However, there are other conditions that can cause your knees to look weird. Here we will discuss some of the most common reasons why your knees might look odd.</p>

<h2>1. Osteoarthritis</h2>

<p>Osteoarthritis is a common form of arthritis that is caused by the breakdown of the cartilage between the bones in the joint. Symptoms of osteoarthritis can include stiffness, swelling, pain, and a decrease in range of motion. Over time, the cartilage can become worn down and the bones in the joint may rub against each other. This can cause the bones to become misaligned and may cause your knees to look odd.</p>

<h2>2. Bursitis</h2>

<p>Bursitis is a condition in which the bursae, small fluid-filled sacs that cushion the bones and tendons in the joint, become inflamed. This can cause pain, swelling, and a decrease in range of motion. It can also cause the joint to look misshapen or deformed. Bursitis is often caused by repetitive motions or injury.</p>

<h2>3. Torn Ligaments or Tendons</h2>

<p>If you have suffered an injury to your knee, it is possible that you may have torn a ligament or tendon. Ligaments and tendons are the tissues that connect the bones in the joint. When they are damaged or torn, they can cause the joint to become misaligned or misshapen. This can cause the joint to look odd and can lead to pain and decreased range of motion.</p>

<h2>4. Bone Spurs</h2>

<p>Bone spurs are bony growths that can form on the bones in the joint. They are caused by a buildup of calcium deposits that can cause the joint to look unusual. Bone spurs can be painful and can limit range of motion. They can also cause swelling and tenderness in the area.</p>

<h2>5. Gout</h2>

<p>Gout is a condition in which uric acid builds up in the joint, causing inflammation and pain. Gout can also cause the joint to look odd as the uric acid crystals accumulate in the joint, causing it to swell. Gout is often very painful and can limit range of motion.</p>
