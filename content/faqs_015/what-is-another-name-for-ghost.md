<p>Ghost is a supernatural being that is believed to be the soul of a deceased person, which can appear, in visible form or other manifestations, to the living. It is also a popular term used to describe an entity that is not seen, heard or felt, but is nevertheless present in some way. In general, the term "ghost" can be used to refer to any supernatural being or entity, including angels, spirits, fairies, and even aliens.</p>

<p>In some contexts, the term "ghost" is also used to describe an entity that is not actually a supernatural being, but rather a form of energy or a phenomenon. For example, some people believe in the existence of "ghosts" of computer programs, which are believed to be able to interact with the physical world in some way. Similarly, some believe that certain places are haunted by the "ghosts" of former inhabitants.</p>

<p>The word "ghost" is derived from the Old English word "gast," which means "breath." It is believed to have originally referred to the spirit or soul of a person, which was thought to linger after death. Over time, the term has come to be used to describe a variety of supernatural beings and entities, as well as phenomena that are not necessarily supernatural in nature.</p>
