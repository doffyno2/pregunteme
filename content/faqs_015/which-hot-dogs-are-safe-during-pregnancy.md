Hot dogs are a popular food choice, but the question of whether it is safe to eat hot dogs during pregnancy is an important one.

Processed meats can contain higher levels of fat, sodium and nitrates, which can increase the risk of certain health problems during pregnancy. 

Pregnant women should avoid eating hot dogs that are not cooked properly. Hot dogs should be cooked until they are steaming hot and the internal temperature has reached at least 74°C (165°F). Pregnant women should also avoid eating hot dogs that have been stored at room temperature for more than two hours.
