If you’ve ever wondered why your pup’s breath smells like poop, you’re not alone. We’ve all been there--and it’s not a pleasant feeling. </p>

<p>Dog breath has a distinctive smell that is generally not pleasant. It can be caused by a variety of factors, and the smell can range from slightly unpleasant to downright toxic.

<p>In addition to plaque and tartar, other common causes of bad breath in dogs include:  </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Food</b>. The type of food and treats your pup eats can have a huge impact on their breath. Low-quality foods can contain bacteria that cause bad breath, as can foods that are high in sugar or fat.</li>
  <li><b>Infection</b>. If your pup has an infection in their mouth, this can cause their breath to smell quite foul. Infections can also occur in the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to bad breath.</li>
  <li><b>Dental Disease</b>. If your pup has a dental disease, such as periodontal disease, this can cause their breath to smell like poop. This is due to the buildup of bacteria in the mouth, which can be very unpleasant.</li>
  <li><b>Organ Disease</b>. If your pup has an organ disease, such as kidney or liver disease, this can also lead to bad breath. This is due to the buildup of toxins in the body, which can be very unpleasant. </li>
