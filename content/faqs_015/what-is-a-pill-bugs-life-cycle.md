Pill bugs, also known as roly-polies or wood lice, are small crustaceans that have become very popular in the pet trade due to their fascinating behavior and hardy nature. They are also known to be great janitors, as they help to keep a clean tank by eating detritus and decaying organisms. Despite their popularity, however, many people don't know much about the life cycle of pill bugs. In this article, we'll take a look at the life cycle of pill bugs, from the egg to the adult stage. 

<h2>Pill Bug Eggs</h2>

Pill bugs lay eggs that are tiny and nearly invisible to the naked eye. The eggs are laid in clusters of several hundred, and the female will often guard them until they hatch. The eggs will hatch in approximately two weeks, depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment. 

<h2>Pill Bug Larvae</h2>

Once the eggs hatch, the larvae will emerge. They are small, white, and have few distinct features at this stage. During the larval stage, the pill bugs will molt several times and will start to develop the segmented exoskeleton that is characteristic of adult pill bugs. 

<h2>Pill Bug Juveniles</h2>

Once the pill bug larvae have molted several times, they will enter the juvenile stage. At this stage, the pill bugs will be larger and will have a more developed exoskeleton. They will also start to develop the distinctive pill bug shape. 

<h2>Adult Pill Bugs</h2>

Once the pill bugs reach adulthood, they will be fully grown and will be able to reproduce. Adult pill bugs are typically between 5 and 8 millimeters in length, and they are dark brown in color. 

<h2>The Pill Bug's Mating Habits</h2>

Pill bugs are typically found in large groups, and when they reach adulthood, they will start to mate. The males will grab onto the females with their pincers and will remain attached until the female lays her eggs. Once the eggs are laid, the male will detach and will move on to the next female. 

<h2>Pill Bug Lifespan</h2>

The lifespan of pill bugs can vary greatly depending on their environment. Generally, in captivity, pill bugs can live for up to two years. In the wild, however, their lifespan can be much shorter due to predation and other factors.
