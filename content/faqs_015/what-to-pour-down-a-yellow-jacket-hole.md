<p>Yellow jackets are wasps that can be found in many regions across the world. They are generally considered to be a nuisance and can be dangerous if they are disturbed or provoked. To help keep these pests away from your property or outdoor activities, you may need to resort to pouring something down their holes to keep them away. But what should you pour down a yellow jacket hole?</p>

If so, you may be able to use a pesticide or insecticide to help deter the yellow jackets from coming back. However, if the hole is in a more difficult-to-reach spot, such as in a wall or under a rock, you may need to use something else to prevent the yellow jackets from returning.</p>
