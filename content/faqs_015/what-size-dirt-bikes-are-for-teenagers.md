Dirt bikes are a great way for teens to enjoy the outdoors and get some exercise while they're at it. But, when it comes to choosing a dirt bike, it's important to consider the size of the bike and the age and size of the rider. For teens, a dirt bike needs to be the right size in order to ensure the rider's safety and comfort. 

<h2>What Age Group Is Considered a Teen?</h2>

When it comes to dirt biking, a teenager is usually considered to be between the ages of 13 and 19. This is a wide range of ages, and the size of bike that is appropriate for each age group can vary considerably. 

<h2>How to Choose the Right Size Dirt Bike for a Teenager</h2>

When choosing a dirt bike for a teenager, there are several factors to consider. The most important factor is the size of the bike itself. Generally speaking, a dirt bike should have a wheelbase of at least 10 inches longer than the rider's inseam. This ensures that the rider can reach the ground with both feet while seated on the bike. 

In addition to wheelbase, the height of the seat should also be taken into account. The seat should be high enough to allow the rider to rest their feet flat on the ground while seated, but not so high that the rider can't reach the ground with their feet even when standing up. 

The weight of the bike is also an important consideration for teenagers. Dirt bikes can range from very light to very heavy and it's important to choose a bike that's the right weight for the rider. A heavier bike can be difficult for a smaller or younger rider to handle, while a lighter bike may not be sturdy enough for a bigger or older rider.

For a 17-year-old, a dirt bike with a wheelbase of 60-70 inches and a seat height of 32-34 inches is usually considered to be an ideal size. Bikes with these measurements should provide a safe and comfortable ride for an older teen.
