<p>Movie popcorn is one of the most popular snacks at the theater, but for some people, it can cause serious health problems. Popcorn is made from corn, which contains a number of allergens, including gluten and dairy. Additionally, the oils and butter used to flavor the popcorn can cause digestive distress, stomach pain, and even nausea in some people. In this article, we'll look at why movie popcorn can make you sick and what you can do to avoid it.</p>

<h2>What Causes Movie Popcorn To Make People Sick?</h2>

<p>Movie popcorn can cause a variety of reactions in people, ranging from mild digestive distress to more severe reactions such as nausea and vomiting. The primary cause of these reactions is the use of oils and butter to flavor the popcorn. These oils are typically high in saturated fats, which can be hard to digest and can cause stomach pain and upset. Additionally, the oils and butter used to flavor the popcorn often contain gluten, dairy, and other allergens, which can trigger allergic reactions in some people.</p>

<p>Another potential cause of movie popcorn-related sickness is the use of artificial preservatives, flavorings, and colorings in the popcorn.
