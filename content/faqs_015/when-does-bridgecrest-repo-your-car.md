<p>When you take out a loan with Bridgecrest, you are responsible for making your payments on time. If you fail to make payments and fall into debt, Bridgecrest may repossess your car. So, when does Bridgecrest repo your car?</p>

<h2>How Does Bridgecrest Repossess Your Car?</h2>

<p>Bridgecrest can repossess your car in a few different ways. The first is a voluntary repossession. This is when you turn your vehicle over to Bridgecrest and agree to the terms of the agreement. This is an easier and more cost-effective way to repossess your car, as it costs less than a traditional repossession.</p>

<p>The second way Bridgecrest can repossess your car is through a traditional repossession. This is when Bridgecrest sends a repossession agent to your home or place of employment to take your vehicle. This is typically more expensive and time-consuming than a voluntary repossession.</p>

<h2>What Happens After Bridgecrest Repossesses Your Car?</h2>

<p>Once Bridgecrest has repossessed your car, they will sell it at an auction. This will cover the costs of the repossession and any remaining balance you owe on the loan. If the sale of your car does not cover the full balance of the loan, you will still be responsible for paying the remaining balance.</p>

<p>You may also be responsible for the costs associated with the repossession, such as storage and towing fees. Bridgecrest may also report the repossession to the credit bureaus, which can negatively impact your credit score. It is important to contact Bridgecrest after the repossession to try to negotiate a repayment plan.</p>

<h2>How Can You Avoid Repossession?</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid repossession is to make your payments on time. If you encounter any financial issues or difficulty making your payments, contact Bridgecrest as soon as possible. They may be able to work with you to adjust your payment plan or find a solution that works for both parties.</p>

<p>You can also try to sell your car yourself before Bridgecrest repossesses it. This can help you avoid the costs associated with a repossession, as well as any negative impacts to your credit score.</p>
