Sunglasses are a stylish accessory that many people wear to protect their eyes from the sun’s harmful UV rays. But did you know that some sunglasses have a cancer warning printed on them? It’s true–many brands of sunglasses have a warning label that reads, “UV exposure from the sun increases the risk of eye disease, including cataracts and cancer.” But why do sunglasses have a cancer warning?

<h2>What Is Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation?</h2>

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a type of invisible light that comes from the sun. UV radiation is divided into three categories: UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVA radiation has the longest wavelengths, and it can penetrate the skin and the eye’s lens. UVB radiation has shorter wavelengths and is mostly absorbed by the ozone layer, but some can still get through and cause sunburn and skin cancer. UVC radiation is the strongest type of UV radiation and is almost completely absorbed by the atmosphere.

<h2>Do Sunglasses Really Protect Against UV Radiation?</h2>

Yes, sunglasses can protect your eyes from UV radiation. The amount of protection depends on the type of glasses you’re wearing. Some sunglasses offer greater protection than others. Look for sunglasses that block 99-100% of UVA and UVB rays. You should also look for glasses that are labeled “UV400” or “100% UV protection.” 

<h2>Can UV Radiation Cause Cancer?</h2>

Yes, UV radiation can cause cancer. The sun’s UV rays can damage the DNA in your eyes, which can lead to the development of certain types of eye cancer.

That’s why it’s important to protect your eyes from UV radiation by wearing sunglasses.
