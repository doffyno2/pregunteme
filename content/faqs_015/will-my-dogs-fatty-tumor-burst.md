<p>Fatty tumors, also called lipomas, are the most common type of soft tissue tumor in dogs. They are slow-growing, benign lumps that are typically found just beneath the skin. They often appear on the chest, abdomen, and legs of dogs, although they can appear anywhere on the body. While fatty tumors are usually harmless, they can cause discomfort or pain if they become large. Some pet owners may wonder if fatty tumors can burst, and if so, what should be done in the event of a rupture.</p>

<h2>What Causes Fatty Tumors?</h2>

<p>Fatty tumors are caused by an accumulation of fat cells that form lumps beneath the skin. The exact cause of fatty tumors is unknown, but some experts believe that genetics and hormones play a role. Dogs of any age can develop fatty tumors, but they are most common in middle-aged and older dogs. </p>

<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Fatty Tumors?</h2>

<p>Fatty tumors are typically soft, round lumps that can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. They are often easy to feel but are not usually painful. Occasionally, a fatty tumor may become enlarged or infected, in which case it may become painful, red, and warm to the touch. </p>

<h2>Can Fatty Tumors Burst?</h2>

<p>While fatty tumors are not usually painful, they can sometimes become large enough to cause discomfort or pain. This can happen if the fatty tumor becomes infected and filled with fluid. In rare cases, a fatty tumor may rupture, spilling the fluid inside the lump. This can be very painful for the dog and can lead to infection. </p>

<h2>What Should Be Done if a Fatty Tumor Bursts?</h2>

<p>If a fatty tumor bursts, it is important to take the dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible. The vet will examine the dog and may take a sample of the fluid to determine whether it is infected. If the vet determines that the tumor is infected, the dog will need to be treated with antibiotics. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the tumor. </p>

<h2>Can Fatty Tumors Be Prevented?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, fatty tumors cannot be prevented in most cases. However, it is important to check the dog for lumps on a regular basis and to take the dog to the vet if any new lumps are found. This will ensure that any tumors are detected and treated early if necessary. </p>
