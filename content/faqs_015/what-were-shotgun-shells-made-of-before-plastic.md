<p>For many centuries, the shotgun has been a reliable and widely used weapon for hunting and military applications. While the current shotgun shells are made of plastic, that wasn’t always the case. In this article, we will explore the different materials that have been used to make shotgun shells throughout history.</p>

<h2>Early Shotgun Shells</h2>

<p>In the earliest days of shotguns, shells were made of paper and filled with gunpowder, shot, and the wadding necessary to keep the shot in the shell. This type of shotgun shell was not very reliable and could easily become damaged or wet, leading to misfires and other issues. Copper shells were also used, but these were expensive and had to be hand-loaded for each shot.</p>

<h2>The Introduction of Brass Shells</h2>

<p>Brass shotgun shells were introduced in the mid-19th century and became the standard for many years. Brass was cheaper than copper and could be mass produced. This made brass shells much more reliable and widely available than the earlier paper and copper shells.</p>

<h2>The Move to Steel Shells</h2>

<p>In the early 20th century, steel shotgun shells were introduced. Steel was cheaper and more durable than brass, and it was easier to machine, so it could be mass-produced more efficiently. Steel shells also had a greater capacity for gunpowder, so they could be used for more powerful shots. Steel shells quickly became the standard for many shotgun users.</p>

<h2>Plastic Shells</h2>

<p>The first plastic shotgun shells were introduced in the 1960s. Plastic was cheaper and easier to manufacture than steel, and it was also lighter and more durable. Plastic shells quickly became the preferred choice for many shotgun users, and by the 1980s, plastic shells had become the standard for most shotguns.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Plastic Shells</h2>

<p>Plastic shotgun shells have several advantages over their predecessors. They are lightweight and easy to carry, they are more resistant to damage and corrosion, they are quieter when fired, and they are easier and cheaper to manufacture. Plastic shells are also easier to reload than brass or steel shells and are easier to store without damage.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Plastic Shells</h2>

<p>Plastic shotgun shells also have some disadvantages. They are more susceptible to temperature changes, which can cause them to expand or contract. They also have a lower capacity than brass or steel shells, which means they can’t be used for as powerful shots. Finally, plastic shells tend to be more expensive than brass or steel shells.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>From paper to plastic, shotgun shells have come a long way in the last few centuries. Early shells were unreliable and had to be hand-loaded for each shot, while modern plastic shells are lightweight, durable, and easy to reload. While plastic shells remain the most popular choice for many shotgun users, there are still some who prefer the reliability and power of brass or steel shells.</p>
