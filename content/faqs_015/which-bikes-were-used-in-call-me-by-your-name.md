<p>Call Me By Your Name is a romantic coming of age story set in the summer of 1983, directed by Luca Guadagnino. The film follows 17-year-old Elio Perlman, played by Timothee Chalamet, as he falls in love with Oliver, an American graduate student played by Armie Hammer. It earned an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Actor. One of the memorable elements of the film is the use of vintage bicycles.</p>

<h2>The Bicycle Scene in Call Me By Your Name</h2>

<p>In the film, Elio and Oliver take a series of rides on two vintage bicycles. The first is Elio’s red Bianchi, a classic Italian road bike made famous by cycling champions of the era. Later they ride a yellow Bianchi mountain bike, also known as a “Bianchina”, which was a popular model in Italy during the 1980s. Both bikes were chosen by the production designer, Violante Visconti di Modrone, to evoke the time period and add to the atmosphere of the story.</p>

<h2>The History of Bianchi Bikes</h2>

<p>The Bianchi brand was founded by Edoardo Bianchi in 1885 and has been producing bicycles for over 130 years. Bianchi is one of the oldest bicycle companies in the world and has been an innovator in the industry since its early days. The company started making bicycles for the Italian Army in the 1890s and later expanded to different models for the racing and touring markets. In the 1930s, Bianchi introduced the first commercially available mountain bike, the Frejus. This was followed by the introduction of the “Bianchina” in the 1950s, which is the model used in Call Me By Your Name.</p>

<h2>The Bianchi Frejus</h2>

<p>The Bianchi Frejus was the first mountain bike to be commercially available. It was designed by the Italian cyclist, Fausto Coppi, and was first released in 1932. It was an unusual design for its time, as it featured a single-speed drivetrain and a rigid frame. The Frejus was designed for off-road riding, which was a relatively new concept at the time. Today, the Frejus is a highly sought-after vintage bike, and is still popular among vintage cycling enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>The Bianchina</h2>

<p>The Bianchina was introduced in the 1950s and was designed to be a more leisurely, comfortable ride. It featured a three-speed hub, a lighter frame, and a step-through frame. This made it ideal for casual city riding, as it was much easier to get on and off than a conventional bike. The Bianchina was extremely popular in Italy, and today it is still a favorite among vintage cycling enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The use of vintage bicycles in Call Me By Your Name is an excellent example of how production designers can evoke a certain time period through their choice of props. The two bicycles used in the film are classic Italian models that were popular during the 1980s. The Bianchi Frejus was the first mountain bike to be commercially available, while the Bianchina was designed for casual city riding. Both models are still popular among vintage cycling enthusiasts today.</p>
