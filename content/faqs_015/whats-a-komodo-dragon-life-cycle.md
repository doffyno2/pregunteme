Komodo dragons are the worldâ€™s largest lizards and one of the most fascinating creatures on Earth. Surprisingly, they have a much more complex life cycle than most people realize. This article will explain what a Komodo dragon life cycle looks like, from its birth to adulthood. 

<h2>Birth and Early Development</h2>

Komodo dragons are born from eggs, which are laid by the female in a well-concealed nest. The female Komodo dragon will lay between 5 and 30 eggs, and these eggs will incubate for a period of 8 to 9 months. During this time, the female will protect the nest from predators, and she may even provide warmth to the eggs. 

Once the eggs hatch, the baby Komodo dragons are about two feet long and immediately set about finding food and avoiding predators. The young dragons mostly feed on insects, small mammals, and other invertebrates. 

<h2>Juvenile Phase</h2>

During the juvenile phase, Komodo dragons continue to grow rapidly and they become more independent. They are also more active and begin to explore their environment more. At this stage, they become increasingly adept at hunting and they begin to eat larger prey such as snakes, lizards, and even other Komodo dragons. 

<h2>Adolescence and Maturation</h2>

The adolescent stage is when Komodo dragons reach sexual maturity and begin to mate. They reach full size at around 8 to 10 years old and can reach up to 10 feet in length and weigh over 200 pounds. 

<h2>Adult Phase</h2>

During the adult phase, Komodo dragons become territorial and will defend their territory from other Komodo dragons. They also become more active and will hunt large animals such as deer, wild boar, and even water buffalo. 

<h2>Old Age and Death</h2>

Komodo dragons can live up to 30 years in the wild, and they reach old age when they are around 25 years old. At this point, their health begins to decline and they become less active. Eventually, they succumb to old age and die.
