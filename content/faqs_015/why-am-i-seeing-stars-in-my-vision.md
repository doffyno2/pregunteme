# Why Am I Seeing Stars in My Vision?

People often experience seeing stars or flashes of light in their vision, which can be a symptom of many different conditions. In this article, we will explore the causes of this phenomenon and discuss how these conditions can be treated.

## What Causes Seeing Stars in My Vision?

Seeing stars or flashes of light in your vision can be caused by a wide range of conditions. Some of the most common causes are:

- Retinal Detachment: Retinal detachment occurs when the thin layer of tissue (the retina) that lines the back of the eye becomes separated from the underlying layer of tissue. This can cause flashes of light in your vision and, if left untreated, can lead to permanent vision loss. 

- Migraines: Migraines can cause flashes of light in your vision, as well as other symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, and headaches. 

- Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the optic nerve, which can cause flashes of light in your vision. It is typically caused by increased pressure within the eye. 

- Cataracts: Cataracts are a clouding of the lens of the eye, which can cause flashes of light in your vision. 

- Optic Nerve Swelling: Optic nerve swelling is a condition in which the optic nerve becomes swollen due to inflammation or a build-up of pressure. This can cause flashes of light in your vision. 

- Retinal Tears: Retinal tears occur when the thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye becomes torn. This can cause flashes of light in your vision.
