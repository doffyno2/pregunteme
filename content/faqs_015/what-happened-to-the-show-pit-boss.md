<p>Pit Boss was a popular reality TV show that aired on Animal Planet from 2010 to 2013. The show followed the day-to-day life of Shorty Rossi, a pit bull breeder and the owner of Shortywood Productions, as he and his team of trainers and handlers worked with pit bulls and other animals. The show was known for its positive portrayal of pit bulls, and it was one of the first reality shows to feature the breed.</p>

<p>The show was a hit for Animal Planet, with its first season reaching an average of 1.4 million viewers per episode. The show was renewed for four seasons and even spawned a spin-off, Pit Boss: South Paw. Unfortunately, the show was cancelled after its fourth season due to declining viewership.</p>

<h2>What Caused The Show’s Cancellation?</h2>

<p>The show’s cancellation has been attributed to a variety of factors. The most likely explanation is that Animal Planet was looking to shift its focus away from “edgier” programming and towards more family-friendly fare. The network had already begun to move away from shows like Pit Boss and towards shows like Finding Bigfoot and Pit Bulls & Parolees. </p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that the show’s ratings had been steadily declining since its first season. The show’s fourth season drew an average of only 538,000 viewers per episode, a far cry from the 1.4 million viewers it had when it first aired in 2010. It’s possible that the show’s popularity had simply reached its peak and was beginning to decline.</p>

<h2>Was The Show’s Cancellation Unexpected?</h2>

<p>The show’s cancellation was not entirely unexpected. While the show had been a hit when it first aired, its ratings had been steadily declining in recent seasons. Additionally, the show had been facing criticism for its portrayal of pit bulls, with animal rights activists arguing that the show was promoting dog fighting. While the show’s producers had denied these accusations, it’s possible that the negative publicity played a role in the show’s cancellation.</p>

<h2>What Happened To The Cast After The Show Ended?</h2>

<p>Since the show ended, the cast has gone their separate ways. Shorty Rossi went on to star in his own reality show, Pit Boss: South Paw, which aired on Animal Planet from 2014 to 2015. The show followed Rossi as he and his team traveled around the country rescuing pit bulls. After the show’s cancellation, Rossi continued to work with pit bulls, appearing on talk shows and doing charity work. </p>

<p>Many of the other cast members have also continued to work with animals. Some have opened their own dog training businesses, while others have gone on to become veterinarians. A few have even gone on to star in other reality shows, including Pit Bulls & Parolees and My Big Fat Pet Makeover.</p>

<h2>What Are The Show's Long-Term Effects?</h2>

<p>The show’s long-term effects are still being felt today. While the show was criticized for its portrayal of pit bulls, it also helped to shed light on the breed and its plight. The show brought attention to the fact that pit bulls are often misunderstood and misrepresented, and that they can make wonderful pets. Many people who watched the show were inspired to adopt a pit bull of their own, and the show has had a lasting impact on the breed.</p>

<p>The show also had a lasting impact on the way the public views animal rescue and adoption. The cast of Pit Boss often visited local animal shelters and highlighted the plight of homeless animals. The show helped to raise awareness of animal rescue and adoption and to inspire people to adopt animals in need.</p>
