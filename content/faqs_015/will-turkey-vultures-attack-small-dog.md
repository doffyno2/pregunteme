<p>Turkey vultures, also known as buzzards, are large birds of prey found throughout North America and parts of South America. They are scavengers, meaning they feed on carrion and other dead animals. While they are not aggressive towards humans, many people worry that they could potentially attack their small dogs. So, the question is: will turkey vultures attack small dogs?</p>

<h2>Do Turkey Vultures Attack Small Dogs?</h2>

<p>The short answer is no, turkey vultures do not typically attack small dogs. Turkey vultures are fairly passive and non-aggressive birds, and are not known to attack living animals. They are much more likely to scavenge on dead animals than to actively pursue and attack a living one. In addition, turkey vultures tend to stay away from areas with people, as they are more likely to find food in less populated areas. As such, they are unlikely to come into contact with small dogs in the first place.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Exceptions?</h2>

<p>That being said, there are some exceptions to the rule that turkey vultures don't attack small dogs. While it is not common, there have been instances of turkey vultures attacking small dogs. In most cases, this is the result of a turkey vulture feeling threatened or cornered. If a small dog gets too close to a turkey vulture, it may become aggressive and try to defend itself. This is especially true if the dog is barking or otherwise making a lot of noise. In rare cases, a turkey vulture may attack a small dog if it feels that its territory is being invaded.</p>

<h2>What If My Dog Is Attacked By A Turkey Vulture?</h2>

<p>If your small dog is attacked by a turkey vulture, it is important to stay calm and take action quickly. First, make sure to move your dog away from the turkey vulture as quickly as possible. If necessary, use a broom or other object to scare off the bird. Once your dog is safely away from the turkey vulture, check for any wounds or injuries. If your dog is injured, seek veterinary care as soon as possible. If the attack was particularly severe, it may be necessary to call animal control or the local police.</p>

<h2>How Can I Protect My Dog From Turkey Vultures?</h2>

<p>The best way to protect your small dog from turkey vultures is to keep it away from areas where turkey vultures might be present. If you live in an area where turkey vultures are common, try to keep your dog on a leash when outdoors. Make sure to stay away from areas with high concentrations of carrion, as this is likely to attract turkey vultures. If you do see a turkey vulture in the area, try to keep your dog away from it. Also, be sure to keep an eye on your dog at all times and be prepared to take action if necessary.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To sum up, turkey vultures do not typically attack small dogs. However, there are some exceptions to this rule and it is important to be aware of the potential risks. If your small dog is attacked by a turkey vulture, it is important to stay calm and take action quickly. The best way to protect your dog from turkey vultures is to keep it away from areas where they might be present.
