<p>Kohler riding mowers are a great choice for those looking for a reliable, easy to use and powerful lawnmower. However, like all motorized machines, they can sometimes experience issues starting up. One of the most common solutions to these issues is to use starter fluid. But where should you spray starter fluid on a Kohler riding mower?</p>

<p>It is important to note that starter fluid, or ether is a very flammable liquid and should be handled with care. It is important to read the instructions on the bottle carefully and follow them to the letter. Starter fluid should also never be used on a hot engine.</p>

<p>The most common place to spray starter fluid on a Kohler riding mower is on the air filter. Starter fluid works by providing a quick burst of additional fuel to the engine, which can help it start more easily. The air filter is the most accessible place to spray the starter fluid, as it is the part of the engine which receives the most air. This is also the safest place to spray the fluid, as it is away from any exposed wires or spark plugs.</p>

<p>It is important to note that starter fluid should not be used as a long-term solution to starting issues. If a Kohler mower is having starting problems, it is important to take it to a qualified technician who can identify and fix the problem. Overusing starter fluid can damage the engine and should be avoided.</p>
