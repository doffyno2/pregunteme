<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you feel like somebody is watching you even though you know for certain that you're alone? This feeling of being watched is common and it can be quite unnerving. It is often referred to as the "creepy feeling" and is usually experienced in the form of a chill down one's spine or a feeling of unease. It can be difficult to explain, but it is a feeling that many people have experienced at least once in their lives.</p>

This feeling can be even more pronounced when a person is in a place they don't feel comfortable in, such as a dark alley or a deserted street.</p>

<p>Finally, the feeling of being watched can also be caused by a person's imagination. When a person is alone in a place and their mind starts to wander, they can start to imagine all sorts of things. This can include imagining that someone is watching them, even if there is no one there.</p>
