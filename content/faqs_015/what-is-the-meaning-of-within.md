Within is an adverb or preposition used to describe a location, time, or distance. It can be used when referring to a location that is inside a building, room, area, or other space. It can also be used to describe a time that is close to the present moment, or a distance that is close to a certain point.

<h2>Location</h2>

When using within to describe a location, it usually means that the object is inside of a certain area. For example, if a person says that the cat is within the house, it means that the cat is inside of the house, but not necessarily in any specific room. The same can be said for other locations, such as within a city, forest, or mountain range.

<h2>Time</h2>

When used to describe a time, within usually means that the time is close to the present. For example, if someone says that they will arrive within the hour, it means that they will arrive at some point during the current hour. It can also be used to describe a time that is close to a certain point in the future, such as within the next week.

<h2>Distance</h2>

Within can also be used to describe a distance that is close to a certain point. For example, if someone says that the store is within walking distance, it means that the store is close enough to be reached on foot. It can also be used to describe a distance that is close to a certain point in space, such as a star being within the Milky Way galaxy.

<h2>Examples</h2>

Here are some examples of how within can be used in a sentence: 

<ul>
  <li>The cat was within the house when I arrived.</li>
  <li>I will arrive within the hour.</li>
  <li>The store is within walking distance.</li>
  <li>The star is within the Milky Way galaxy.</li>
</ul>
