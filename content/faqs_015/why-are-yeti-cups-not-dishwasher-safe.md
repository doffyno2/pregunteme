<p>Yeti cups are all the rage these days. Whether you choose a Yeti tumbler, a Yeti bottle, or a Yeti mug, you can be sure you’re getting a quality product. Yeti cups and tumblers are widely known for their superior insulation capabilities and durability. But even the toughest of Yeti cups aren’t dishwasher safe. So why are Yeti cups not dishwasher safe?</p>

<h2>What Makes Yeti Cups Different?</h2>

<p>Yeti cups are made out of stainless steel, which offers several advantages over other materials. Stainless steel is highly durable, so it won’t break, warp, or rust. It also doesn’t corrode, so the cup won’t spoil your drink or food if it gets wet. Stainless steel is also non-porous, which means that it won’t absorb odors or flavors from the contents of the cup.</p>

<h2>Why Are Yeti Cups Not Dishwasher Safe?</h2>

<p>Despite their durability and superior insulation capabilities, Yeti cups are not dishwasher safe. This is due to the fact that Yeti cups are made out of stainless steel, which can be damaged by the intense heat and harsh detergents found in a dishwasher. The high temperatures and harsh chemicals can cause the stainless steel to warp and corrode, which could potentially ruin the cup. In addition, the harsh detergents can strip away the protective coating on the stainless steel, which can lead to rust and corrosion.</p>

<h2>How Should You Clean Your Yeti Cup?</h2>

<p>The best way to clean your Yeti cup is to hand-wash it with warm, soapy water. Use a soft sponge or cloth and make sure to rinse the cup thoroughly after washing. If you need to get rid of any tough stains, you can use a mild abrasive such as baking soda or vinegar. If you’re washing a Yeti mug or tumbler, you should also make sure to dry out the lid and seal before putting it back on the cup.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Alternatives To Hand Washing?</h2>

<p>If you don’t want to hand wash your Yeti cup, you can use a bottle brush or a pipe cleaner to clean the inside. You can also use a mild detergent to clean the outside of the cup. Just make sure to rinse the cup thoroughly and allow it to air dry.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Yeti cups are incredibly popular due to their superior insulation capabilities and durability. However, they are not dishwasher safe due to the fact that the intense heat and harsh detergents can damage the stainless steel. The best way to clean your Yeti cup is to hand wash it with warm, soapy water and a soft sponge or cloth. You can also use a bottle brush or pipe cleaner to clean the inside, and a mild detergent to clean the outside. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your Yeti cup stays in pristine condition.</p>
