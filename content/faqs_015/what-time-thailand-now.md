Thailand is an incredibly popular destination for tourists and business travelers alike, and with its many attractions, it's easy to see why. But one of the first questions travelers have is, "What time is it in Thailand now?" Knowing the local time will help you plan your activities and stay on top of any meetings or deadlines.
