<h2>What is Diatomaceous Earth?</h2>

Diatomaceous earth, often referred to as DE, is a naturally occurring, soft, silicate sedimentary rock which is composed of the fossilized remains of diatoms. Diatoms are microscopic, single-celled algae that are found in both fresh and salt water environments. DE is mined in various locations around the world, including the United States, South Africa, and Germany.

<h2>What are the Benefits of Diatomaceous Earth?</h2>

DE has many beneficial uses, including being used as a natural insecticide and as an animal feed additive. It is also believed to have health benefits when taken internally, such as being a natural detoxification agent and helping reduce inflammation.

<h2>What Does Diatomaceous Earth Do to Dogs?</h2>

When dogs come into contact with DE, it can cause irritation to their skin and respiratory systems. This is because DE is composed of microscopic particles that can cause abrasive damage to the mucous membranes and skin of dogs. If a dog inhales DE, it can cause coughing, sneezing, and irritation to their eyes.

<h2>Is it Safe for Dogs to Walk on Diatomaceous Earth?</h2>
