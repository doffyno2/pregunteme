<p>It is often thought that blood can freeze inside the body, yet the truth is that the human body is remarkable in its ability to maintain the temperature of its internal organs and systems. In this article, we will discuss the temperatures that blood can reach inside the body and what might happen if these temperatures are exceeded.</p>

<h2>What is the Normal Temperature of Blood?</h2>

<p>The normal temperature of human blood is usually between 97.7 and 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius). This temperature is maintained by the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms, which help to keep the core temperature of the body within a very narrow range.</p>

<h2>What Temperature Does Blood Freeze?</h2>

<p>Blood does not freeze at any temperature that occurs in the human body. The freezing point of human blood is around -9 degrees Fahrenheit (-23 degrees Celsius). When exposed to temperatures lower than this, the cells of the blood will start to break down and the water within the cells will crystallize.</p>

<h2>What is Hypothermia?</h2>

<p>Hypothermia is a medical condition in which the body's core temperature drops below the normal range. This can occur when a person is exposed to cold temperatures for a prolonged period of time. Symptoms of hypothermia include shivering, confusion, and drowsiness.</p>

<h2>What is the Lowest Core Temperature a Person Can Survive?</h2>

<p>The lowest core temperature a person can survive is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). At this temperature, a person will be unconscious and may even be in a coma. It is possible to survive temperatures lower than this, but the risk of death or serious organ damage increases significantly.</p>

<h2>What Happens if the Core Temperature of a Person's Body Falls Below 70 Degrees Fahrenheit?</h2>

<p>If the core temperature of a person's body falls below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), the person is likely to suffer from hypothermia. Hypothermia can cause a variety of serious medical problems, including heart attack, stroke, organ failure, and even death. It is essential to seek medical help immediately if you or someone you know experiences symptoms of hypothermia.</p>

<h2>What Temperature Does Blood Freeze in Animals?</h2>

<p>The temperature at which blood freezes varies depending on the type of animal. For example, the freezing point of human blood is around -9 degrees Fahrenheit (-23 degrees Celsius). In contrast, the freezing point of blood in a polar bear is much lower at around -58 degrees Fahrenheit (-50 degrees Celsius).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The human body is remarkable in its ability to maintain the temperature of its internal organs and systems. Blood does not freeze at any temperature that occurs in the human body and the lowest core temperature a person can survive is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). It is essential to seek medical help immediately if you or someone you know experiences symptoms of hypothermia.</p>
