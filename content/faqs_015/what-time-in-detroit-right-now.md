<h2>What Is Daylight Savings Time?</h2>

<p>Daylight Savings Time (DST) is a system that was implemented in many countries around the world to conserve energy. During DST, clocks are moved forward one hour so that people can take advantage of the extra hour of sunlight during the summer months.

In the fall, clocks move back one hour so that people can enjoy the extra hour of sunlight during the winter months. </p>

<p>In the United States, Daylight Savings Time begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. So, during the summer months, Detroit is four hours behind GMT and during the winter months it is six hours behind GMT. </p>
