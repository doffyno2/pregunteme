Riders should also stay in control of the bull by using their legs and feet to help keep the bull steady. Additionally, riders should use their arms to keep the bull's head up and to help guide it in the direction they want it to go. If the bull begins to buck, riders should stay relaxed and lean back as far as possible in an effort to remain balanced.

To ensure the safety of riders, bull riding competitions have a variety of safety measures in place. Riders are required to wear protective clothing such as helmets, vests, and leg guards.
