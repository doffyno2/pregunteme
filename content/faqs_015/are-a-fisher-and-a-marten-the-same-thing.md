Fisher and Marten are two species of animals that are related but are not the same thing. While they may look similar, there are distinct differences between the two. In this article, we will explore the differences between a fisher and a marten, as well as the similarities and differences between their habitats, behaviors, and diets.

<h2>What is a Fisher?</h2>

A fisher is a large member of the weasel family. It is found in the northern parts of North America, ranging from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Coast. The fisher is a solitary animal, usually living alone and avoiding contact with other animals. It is a nocturnal animal, meaning it is active mostly at night. A fisher is a medium-sized mammal, measuring up to 3 feet in length, with males being larger than females. Its fur is dark brown, with white patches on its chest, belly, and feet.

<h2>What is a Marten?</h2>

A marten is a smaller member of the weasel family. It is found in northern parts of North America, from Alaska to the Atlantic Coast. Unlike the fisher, the marten is a diurnal animal, meaning it is active during the day. It is a small mammal, measuring up to 2 feet in length. Its fur is yellowish-brown, with white patches on its chest, belly, and feet.
