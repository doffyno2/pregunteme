UTC is used in many countries around the world, and is the official time in the European Union.

UTC and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) are very similar, but there are some differences. UTC is based on the average rotational speed of the Earth, whereas GMT is based on the mean solar time at Greenwich. GMT is used in some countries, but UTC is the official standard time in the European Union and is used in many countries around the world.
