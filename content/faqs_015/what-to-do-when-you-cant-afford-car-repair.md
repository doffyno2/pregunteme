<p>When you experience car trouble, it can be a stressful and expensive experience. It is especially difficult to handle when you don't have the money to pay for the repairs. If you find yourself in this situation, here are some tips for what to do when you can't afford car repair.</p>

<h2>Assess the Situation</h2>

<p>The first step is to assess the situation. Is the problem serious enough that you need to get it fixed right away? If it is a minor issue, such as a flat tire or a broken headlight, you may be able to put off the repair until you can afford it. However, if it is something more serious, such as a broken engine or transmission, you will likely need to get it fixed as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Explore Your Options</h2>

<p>Once you have assessed the situation, you can explore your options. If you have an emergency fund set up, you may be able to use that to pay for the repairs. If not, you can look into financing options such as a loan or credit card. You can also look into getting a cash advance on your credit card. Additionally, some car repair shops offer financing options.</p>

<h2>Ask for Help</h2>

<p>If you are unable to pay for the repairs yourself, you may want to ask for help. Ask family and friends if they can loan you the money or if they can help you out with the costs. You may also be able to get help from a charity or non-profit organization.</p>

<h2>Do It Yourself</h2>

<p>If you are mechanically inclined, you may be able to save money by doing the repairs yourself. However, it is important to remember that car repairs can be dangerous, so you should only attempt them if you are sure you know what you are doing. If you are not sure, it is better to have a professional do the repairs. Additionally, some car repairs require special tools or parts which you may not have access to.</p>

<h2>Find a Discount</h2>

<p>If you need to have the repairs done professionally, there are ways to save money. Look for coupons or discounts on the repair shop's website or ask if they offer any specials. You can also ask if they accept payment plans or if they can do the repairs for a discounted price. Additionally, some repair shops offer loyalty programs that offer discounts for returning customers.</p>

<h2>Consider Used Parts</h2>

<p>When having your car repaired, you may want to consider using used parts. Used parts can be much cheaper than new parts and are often just as good. However, make sure you do your research and make sure the used parts are of good quality before you buy them.</p>
