It's hot outside, and you're looking for the perfect outfit to keep you cool while still looking stylish. With temperatures soaring, it can be a challenge to find something that will keep you comfortable and looking your best. Whether you're heading out for a day in the sun or simply wanting to stay cool indoors, here are some tips on what to wear in 90 degree weather.

<h2>Choose Lightweight Materials</h2>

When temperatures reach 90 degrees, choose lightweight fabrics that allow your skin to breathe. Natural fibers, like cotton, linen and rayon, are ideal for hot weather. They draw moisture away from the body so you'll stay cool and dry. Stay away from synthetic fabrics, like polyester, which can be uncomfortable and trap heat against the skin. 

<h2>Opt for Loose-Fitting Clothing</h2>

When it's hot outside, you don't want anything tight against your body. Choose loose-fitting clothing that won't stick to you and will allow air to circulate around your body. Flowy dresses, skirts and shorts are all excellent options. Avoid heavy fabrics like denim, which can be uncomfortable and can trap heat against your skin. 

<h2>Go for Bright Colors</h2>

Bright colors are a great way to stay cool in hot weather. Light colors, such as white and pastels, reflect the sun's rays, keeping you cooler than darker colors. Plus, wearing bright colors can instantly brighten your mood and make you feel more cheerful. 

<h2>Choose the Right Shoes</h2>

When it comes to keeping your feet cool in hot weather, choose lightweight sandals or breathable shoes. Skip the heavy, closed-toe shoes and opt for something that will allow your feet to breathe. Also, make sure to choose shoes with good arch support to prevent fatigue. 

<h2>Wear a Hat and Sunglasses</h2>

Protect your head and eyes from the sun's rays by wearing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. Wearing a hat can help keep you cool and will also protect your face from the sun's harsh rays. Choose sunglasses that block out at least 99% of UVA and UVB rays. 

<h2>Accessorize with Scarves and Wraps</h2>

Scarves and wraps are an excellent way to add an extra layer of comfort when it's hot outside. You can use them to protect your skin from the sun during the day, or you can wrap them around your shoulders to keep you warm during cool evenings. They also make a great fashion statement! 

<h2>Stay Hydrated</h2>

When temperatures reach 90 degrees, it's important to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water to keep your body cool and replenished. Avoid drinks with caffeine or alcohol, as these can be dehydrating.
