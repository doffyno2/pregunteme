Sand dollars are small, flat, round creatures that live on the ocean floor. They are related to sea urchins, but are smaller and have a distinctive pattern of small bumps on their surface. Sand dollars are a type of echinoderm, a group of animals that also includes starfish, sea cucumbers and sea urchins. All echinoderms share the same basic body plan: a central disk surrounded by five arms or rays. 

Although sand dollars look like coins, they actually have a complex life cycle. The cycle begins with a free-swimming larva and ends with a mature adult. In between, the sand dollar goes through several stages of development, during which it changes shape and color. Understanding the life cycle of the sand dollar can help scientists understand the ecology of the oceans and the relationships between different species.

<h2>The Life Cycle of a Sand Dollar</h2>

The life cycle of a sand dollar begins with a larva, which is a free-swimming stage. The larva develops from a fertilized egg, which is released by the female during spawning. The larvae are tiny and transparent, and lack the distinctive bumps of the adult sand dollar. 

<h3>Feeding Larvae</h3>

The larvae feed on plankton and other small particles in the water. As they grow, they become more active and develop an internal skeleton. They also develop a thick, protective layer of calcium carbonate, which is what gives the sand dollar its distinctive shape and texture. After a few weeks, the larvae settle on the ocean floor and become juvenile sand dollars. 

<h3>Juvenile Stage</h3>

At this stage, the sand dollar is still relatively small and transparent. It is actively feeding on organisms such as small crustaceans, worms and algae. As it grows, its color begins to change and its skeleton starts to harden. The juvenile sand dollar will eventually reach a size of about 1 inch in diameter.

<h3>Mature Stage</h3>

Once the sand dollar reaches its mature stage, it is about 1.5 inches in diameter and has a distinctive pattern of small bumps on its surface. These bumps are actually tiny spines, which the sand dollar uses to move and feed. The mature sand dollar is no longer actively feeding but instead uses its spines to filter small particles out of the water. 

<h3>Reproduction</h3>

When the sand dollar is ready to reproduce, it releases eggs and sperm into the water. The sperm fertilizes the eggs, which then develop into larvae and start the cycle again.

<h3>Where do sand dollars live?</h3>
Sand dollars live on the ocean floor. They can be found in shallow waters near coral reefs and sandy seabeds, as well as in deeper waters. 

<h3>What is the size of a mature sand dollar?</h3>
A mature sand dollar is about 1.5 inches in diameter. 

<h3>How do sand dollars move?</h3>
Sand dollars move using their spines. The spines act like tiny legs and help the sand dollar crawl across the ocean floor. 

<h3>What do sand dollars eat?</h3>
Sand dollars feed on plankton and other small particles in the water. As juveniles, they also feed on small crustaceans, worms and algae. 

<h3>What is the color of a sand dollar?</h3>
The color of a sand dollar varies depending on its stage of life. As larvae, they are small and transparent. As juveniles, they are usually tan in color. As adults, they range in color from white to gray. 

<h3>How long does a sand dollar live?</h3>
The average lifespan of a sand dollar is about three years. 

<h3>What is the difference between a sand dollar and a sea urchin?</h3>
The main difference between a sand dollar and a sea urchin is size. Sand dollars are smaller than sea urchins and have a distinctive pattern of small bumps on their surface. 

<h3>How many eggs does a sand dollar lay?</h3>
A female sand dollar can lay up to two million eggs in a single spawning event. 

<h3>How do sand dollars reproduce?</h3>
Sand dollars reproduce by releasing eggs and sperm into the water. The sperm fertilizes the eggs, which then develop into larvae and start the cycle again. 

<h3>What predators do sand dollars have?</h3>
Sand dollars have a few predators, including crabs, sea stars, and some fish species. 

<h3>Do sand dollars have any economic value?</h3>
Sand dollars have some economic value as they are often used for decoration or as souvenirs. They are also harvested for use in medicine and jewelry. 

<h3>Can sand dollars swim?</h3>
Sand dollars cannot swim, but they can move by crawling across the ocean floor using their spines. 

<h3>What is the scientific name for a sand dollar?</h3>
The scientific name for a sand dollar is Echinarachnius parma.
