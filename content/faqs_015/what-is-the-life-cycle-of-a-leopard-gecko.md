<p>Leopard geckos are one of the most popular pet lizards in the world, and for good reason. They are relatively easy to care for, have an interesting life cycle, and are quite hardy. In this article, we will look at the life cycle of a leopard gecko, from egg to adult.</p>

<h2>Egg Laying and Incubation</h2>

<p>Female leopard geckos usually lay one clutch of two eggs per year. The eggs are generally laid in a sheltered area, such as under a rock or in a hide. Leopard gecko eggs are quite large, and are typically a creamy brown in color. After the eggs are laid, they should be incubated in a warm, humid environment. The optimal incubation temperature is around 86°F (30°C) with a humidity of 80-90%. The incubation period can vary, but is typically between 45-60 days.</p>

<h2>Hatching</h2>

<p>When the eggs are ready to hatch, the baby leopard geckos will start to move inside the egg. Eventually, they will break through the eggshell and emerge as neonates. At this stage, the baby geckos will be only a few centimeters in length and will weigh just a few grams. They are usually dark brown or black in color and have bright yellow or orange stripes.</p>

<h2>Juveniles</h2>

<p>As the juvenile leopard geckos grow, they will shed their skin several times. At each shed, their color and pattern will become brighter and more distinct. Juveniles should be fed small insects, such as crickets or mealworms, two to three times per week. They should also be given a calcium supplement every other day. As they grow, they should be provided with larger insects and introduced to a calcium and vitamin D3 supplement.</p>

<h2>Adolescence</h2>

<p>Leopard geckos reach sexual maturity at around 18 months of age. At this point, they should be separated by sex to avoid breeding. Males will typically reach a larger size than females and can be identified by the presence of pre-anal pores. Females will also have enlarged femoral pores, but these are not as obvious as the male's pre-anal pores.</p>

<h2>Adulthood</h2>

<p>Once the leopard geckos reach adulthood, they can be kept together in pairs or groups. Adults should be fed appropriately sized insects three to four times a week. They should also be offered a calcium and vitamin D3 supplement every few days. With proper care, leopard geckos can live for up to 10-15 years in captivity.</p>
