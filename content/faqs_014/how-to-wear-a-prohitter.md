<p>A Prohitter is a specialized piece of batting equipment used by professional, collegiate and some recreational baseball players to improve their batting performance. The Prohitter, which is shaped like a curved piece of plastic, is held in the palm of the batter’s hand and extends the length of the batter’s arm. The Prohitter helps batters to maintain a correct stance, swing and contact with the baseball. With practice and proper use, the Prohitter can help batters increase their batting average.</p>

<h2>Getting the Right Prohitter Size</h2>

<p>When purchasing a Prohitter, it is important to select the right size. The Prohitter comes in four sizes: small (for players under 5'2"), medium (for players 5'2" to 5'9"), large (for players 5'9" to 6'2"), and extra-large (for players over 6'2"). It is important to select the right size Prohitter because a Prohitter that is too small will be uncomfortable and a Prohitter that is too large will not provide the correct support. Generally, a player should measure from the tip of their middle finger to their elbow and select the Prohitter size that is closest to that measurement.</p>

<h2>Using the Prohitter</h2>

<p>The Prohitter should be worn on the dominant hand of the batter, usually the right hand for a right-handed batter and the left hand for a left-handed batter. The Prohitter should be placed in the palm of the hand and the batter should wrap their fingers around it. The Prohitter should fit firmly in the hand and the batter should be able to grip it securely. The curved portion of the Prohitter should be placed on the outside of the hand and the flat portion should be placed on the inside. The Prohitter should extend from the base of the palm to the middle of the forearm.</p>

<p>When using a Prohitter, it is important to keep the arm in a slightly bent position and to keep the elbow close to the body. This allows the batter to maintain a proper stance and swing that will help them make better contact with the ball. The Prohitter should also be used during warm-up drills and practice sessions to help the batter develop a proper swing and contact with the ball.</p>

<h2>Caring for a Prohitter</h2>

<p>It is important to care for a Prohitter properly in order to get the most out of it. The Prohitter should be wiped down after each use with a clean, dry cloth. This will help remove dirt and grime that can accumulate on the Prohitter and cause it to become less effective. The Prohitter should also be stored in a cool, dry place when not in use to prevent it from becoming damaged or warped.</p>
