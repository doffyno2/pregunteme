Rolling coal is a popular trend in the diesel truck community, where a diesel truck has been modified to output larger amounts of black smoke. This practice is often seen as a way of “sticking it to the man” and showing off one’s truck. However, it is illegal in many states and can cause serious environmental damage. In this guide, we will discuss what rolling coal is, why it is popular, and how to do it safely and legally. 

<h2>What is Rolling Coal?</h2>

Rolling coal is a modification to diesel trucks that increases the amount of black smoke released from the exhaust. This is achieved by manipulating the engine to burn more fuel than usual, which causes the exhaust to output more soot or black smoke. The process of “rolling coal” is when a driver intentionally releases this extra smoke in a controlled manner. 

<h2>Why Do People Roll Coal?</h2>

Many people in the diesel truck community roll coal as a way to show off their trucks and “stick it to the man.” In states where diesel trucks are not allowed, rolling coal can be seen as a way of showing defiance and expressing one’s freedom. It can also be seen as a show of strength, as it demonstrates the power of the engine. 

<h2>How to Roll Coal</h2>

Rolling coal can be dangerous and illegal in some states, so it is important to do it safely and legally. The first step is to ensure that the engine is in good condition and properly tuned. The next step is to install a smoke switch. This is a device that will allow the driver to control the amount of fuel being burned and the amount of smoke being released. 

Once the smoke switch is installed, the driver can begin rolling coal. The driver should start by slowly increasing the amount of smoke being released, and then slowly releasing it. The driver should be aware of the surrounding environment and make sure not to release too much smoke, as this could be illegal or even dangerous. 

<h2>Is Rolling Coal Legal?</h2>

The legality of rolling coal varies from state to state. In some states, it is illegal to roll coal due to the environmental damage it can cause. In other states, it is legal, but there are still restrictions on the amount of smoke that can be released. It is important to check the laws in your area before attempting to roll coal. 

<h2>Is Rolling Coal Dangerous?</h2>

Rolling coal can be dangerous if done improperly. It can put a strain on the engine and exhaust system, potentially leading to costly repairs. It can also cause environmental damage, as the black smoke released from the exhaust is full of pollutants. It is important to be aware of the risks before attempting to roll coal. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Rolling coal is a popular trend in the diesel truck community, and can be a great way to show off one’s truck. However, it is important to do it safely and legally, as it can be dangerous and illegal in some states. Before attempting to roll coal, it is important to check the laws in your area and make sure that the engine and exhaust system are in good condition.
