<p>At first glance, it might seem impossible to identify a Peugeot bike model. After all, the company has been producing high-quality bicycles since the late 19th century, and they’ve changed a lot over the years. But don’t worry – with a bit of research and some careful observation, you can easily figure out the exact model of your Peugeot bike. Here’s how.</p>

<h2>Check the Serial Number</h2>

<p>The first thing you should do is look for the serial number. This is usually printed on the underside of the bottom bracket, but it can also be found on the frame or the head tube. The serial number will usually begin with the letters “PE” followed by several digits. The last two digits are usually the year of manufacture, which can help you identify the model.</p>

<h2>Identify the Frame Material</h2>

<p>The frame material will give you a good indication of the model of your Peugeot bike. Steel frames are the most common and were used on many models up until the 1980s. Aluminum frames were used on models from the 1980s onward. Carbon fiber frames were used on high-end models from the 2000s.</p>

<h2>Observe the Components</h2>

<p>The components of your Peugeot bike can also provide clues as to the model. Look at the brakes, shifters, derailleurs, and other components. If they’re made of plastic or alloy, it’s likely that your bike is from the 1980s or later. If they’re made of steel, it’s likely from before the 1980s.</p>

<h2>Look for Peugeot Logos</h2>

<p>The Peugeot logo can provide clues as to the model of your bike. The most common logo is the “PE” logo, which was used on most models from the late 19th century to the early 21st century. The “PEU” logo was used from the 1950s to the 1980s, while the “PEUGEOT” logo was used from the 1980s onward.</p>

<h2>Research the Model</h2>

<p>Once you’ve identified the serial number, frame material, components, and logo, you can use the information to research the model of your Peugeot bike. You can search online for “Peugeot [serial number]” or “Peugeot [frame material]” to find out more information. You can also search for “Peugeot [logo]” to find out more information.</p>
