How to Repair a Cracked Radiator Plastic


Radiator plastic is a common material used in the construction of radiators. It can crack over time due to the high temperatures that radiators are exposed to on a daily basis. Fortunately, there are ways to repair a cracked radiator plastic without having to replace the entire radiator.

<h2>Steps to Repair a Cracked Radiator Plastic</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Radiator</h3>

The first step in repairing a cracked radiator plastic is to prepare the radiator. This includes removing any dirt or debris from the area around the crack.
