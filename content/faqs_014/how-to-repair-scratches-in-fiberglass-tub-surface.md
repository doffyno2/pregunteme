<p>If you find yourself in need of a fiberglass tub repair, you’re likely dealing with scratches. Whether the scratches are deep or superficial, the process for fixing them is the same. With the right supplies and techniques, you can repair those scratches yourself and have your tub looking like new in no time.</p>

<h2>Gather Your Supplies</h2>

<p>Before you start your repair, you’ll need to gather the necessary supplies. First, you’ll need a fiberglass repair kit. These kits can be found at most hardware stores and typically come with a fiberglass repair patch. The patch should be the same color as your tub and should match its texture. You’ll also need sandpaper, rags, and a putty knife. </p>

<h2>Sand the Area</h2>

<p>Once you have your supplies, you’ll need to start by sanding the area around the scratch. Use a fine grit sandpaper or a sanding sponge to gently sand the area. Make sure to be careful and not to press too hard. You want to be sure to remove any sharp edges and make the surface even. </p>

<h2>Clean the Area</h2>

<p>Once the area is sanded, you’ll need to clean it. Use a wet rag to wipe away any dust or debris. You’ll also need to make sure the area is free of soap scum or other residue. </p>

<h2>Apply the Fiberglass Repair Patch</h2>

<p>Now that the area is prepped, you’re ready to apply the fiberglass repair patch. Place the patch onto the scratched area and use a putty knife to press it into place. Be sure to press firmly so the patch adheres to the surface. </p>

<h2>Smooth the Patch</h2>

<p>Once the patch is in place, use the putty knife to smooth the edges. You want to make sure the patch is completely flush with the surface of the tub. </p>

<h2>Sand the Patch</h2>

<p>Once the patch is smoothed, you’ll need to sand it. Use a fine grit sandpaper or sanding sponge to lightly sand the patch. This will ensure the patch is completely blended with the surface of the tub. </p>
