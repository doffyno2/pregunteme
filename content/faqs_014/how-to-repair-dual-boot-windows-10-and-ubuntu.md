<p>Dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu is a great way to get the best of both worlds. With a dual boot setup, you can have both operating systems installed on one computer and choose which one to boot into when you power it on. However, dual booting can cause issues if not done correctly, leaving you with a computer that won't boot or won't boot into the desired OS. This guide will show you how to repair a dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu setup so that you can get back up and running.</p>

<h2>Overview of Dual Booting</h2>

<p>Dual booting is the process of installing two operating systems on the same computer. When you power on the computer, you are presented with a menu from which you can choose which OS you want to boot into. This allows you to have the best of both worlds, as each OS can be used for different tasks. For example, you could use Windows for gaming and Ubuntu for web development.</p>

<p>The process of dual booting is not always straightforward, and can lead to issues if not done correctly. In some cases, you may end up with a computer that won't boot or won't boot into the desired OS. This guide will show you how to repair a dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu setup so that you can get back up and running.</p>

<h2>Steps to Repair Dual Boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Check Boot Order</h3>

<p>The first step to repairing a dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu setup is to check the boot order. This is the order in which your computer will attempt to boot into each OS. To check the boot order, open the BIOS/UEFI settings and navigate to the "Boot Order" section. Here, you will see a list of all the available boot devices. Make sure that the Windows bootloader is at the top of the list, followed by the Ubuntu bootloader. If the order is incorrect, you can adjust it by selecting the desired boot device and pressing the "Move Up" button until it is in the desired position.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Check Boot Configuration</h3>

<p>The next step is to check the boot configuration. This is the set of options that dictate how the computer will boot into an OS. To check the boot configuration, open the BIOS/UEFI settings and navigate to the "Boot" section. Here, you will see a list of all the available boot devices. Make sure that the Windows bootloader is set to the "LEGACY" option, and the Ubuntu bootloader is set to the "UEFI" option. If these settings are incorrect, you can adjust them by selecting the desired option and pressing the "Save & Exit" button.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Update Boot Loaders</h3>

<p>The next step is to update the boot loaders. This is the software that allows your computer to boot into an OS. To update the boot loaders, open the BIOS/UEFI settings and navigate to the "Boot" section. Here, you will see a list of all the available boot devices. Select the Windows bootloader and press the "Update" button. Once the update is complete, select the Ubuntu bootloader and press the "Update" button. Once both updates are complete, press the "Save & Exit" button.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Check Boot Partitions</h3>

<p>The final step is to check the boot partitions. This is the set of partitions that store the operating system files. To check the boot partitions, open the BIOS/UEFI settings and navigate to the "Boot" section. Here, you will see a list of all the available boot devices. Make sure that both the Windows and Ubuntu boot partitions are listed. If one of them is missing, you can add it by selecting the partition and pressing the "Add" button.</p>
