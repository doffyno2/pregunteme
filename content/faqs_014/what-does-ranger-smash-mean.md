<p>Ranger Smash is a phrase used to describe a particular type of combat maneuver in the popular role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. It is a powerful attack that allows a character to attack multiple enemies at once, often with devastating results. The maneuver is commonly used by rangers, and has become synonymous with the ranger class in the game.</p>

<p>Ranger Smash is a type of maneuver that is only available to characters who have the ranger class. It is a special attack that allows the character to make multiple attacks in a single round. When using Ranger Smash, the character can attack one or more creatures at the same time. This allows the character to quickly take out large groups of enemies at once, which can be invaluable in a group combat situation.</p>

<p>The Ranger Smash maneuver is an optional rule in Dungeons and Dragons. It is not a part of the core ruleset, but it is widely accepted among experienced players. While the maneuver can be powerful, it can also be dangerous. Players should use caution when using Ranger Smash and make sure that their character is capable of taking on multiple opponents at once.</p>

<p>For Rangers, Ranger Smash is an incredibly useful maneuver. It allows them to quickly take out large groups of enemies and can be invaluable in a group combat situation. It also allows Rangers to do more damage than they normally would with a single attack, which can be a great advantage in combat. While it can be dangerous, it can also be a great asset for a Ranger.</p>

<h2>How To Use Ranger Smash</h2>

<p>Ranger Smash is a powerful attack, but it requires some preparation beforehand. First, the character must choose a target. This can be any creature within their line of sight. Once the target is chosen, the character must then ready an action to use Ranger Smash. This requires the character to spend their action on their turn, and they must ready the action before their turn begins.</p>

<p>Once the action is readied, the character can then make a single attack against the target. If the attack hits, it will deal damage to all creatures within reach of the target. This includes any creatures that are adjacent to the target as well as any creatures that are within five feet of the target. The damage dealt is determined by the character's attack roll, and any creatures that are hit take full damage from the attack.</p>

<p>Ranger Smash is an incredibly powerful maneuver and can be incredibly useful in combat. However, it can also be dangerous if not used correctly. Players should use caution when using Ranger Smash and make sure that their character is capable of taking on multiple opponents at once. Additionally, Rangers should use Ranger Smash sparingly, as it can quickly deplete their resources if used too often.</p>
