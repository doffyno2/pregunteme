<p>A windbreaker is an essential item of clothing for anyone who wants to brave the cold weather during the winter months.

Fleece-lined jackets are lined with a thick, insulating layer of fleece, which keeps the wearer warm in cold temperatures. Insulated jackets are made with a synthetic insulation, such as Thinsulate or PrimaLoft, which provides warmth without adding bulk. </p>
