<p>If you own an Electrolux washing machine, you may have noticed that it has an interesting feature called a Clean Tub Cycle. This function helps to keep the inside of your washing machine clean, free of odors, and free of mildew and mold. In this article, we will explain how to start a Clean Tub Cycle on an Electrolux washing machine, as well as what to expect during the cycle. </p>

<h2>What is a Clean Tub Cycle?</h2>

<p>A Clean Tub Cycle is a special cycle that is available on Electrolux washing machines. It is designed to help keep your washing machine clean and free of odors, as well as mildew and mold. The cycle uses a special detergent that is designed to break down mildew, mold, and other particles that can accumulate in the tub of your washing machine. </p>

<h2>How to Start a Clean Tub Cycle on an Electrolux Washing Machine</h2>

<p>Starting a Clean Tub Cycle on an Electrolux washing machine is relatively easy. First, you need to make sure that you have the right detergent for the cycle. You can purchase special detergent specifically designed for the Clean Tub Cycle from most stores that sell Electrolux washing machines. </p>

<p>Once you have the detergent, you need to add it to the detergent dispenser on your washing machine. Make sure to follow the instructions on the detergent package for the correct amount of detergent to use. </p>

<p>Once the detergent is in the dispenser, you can start the Clean Tub Cycle. To do this, press the “Power” button on your washing machine and then press the “Clean Tub” button. The Clean Tub Cycle will begin and the washing machine will start to fill with water. </p>

<p>Once the water has filled the washing machine, the cycle will start. The washing machine will begin to agitate the water and detergent mixture, which will help to break down any mildew, mold, and other particles that may be present in the tub. </p>

<p>After the cycle is complete, the washing machine will drain the water and detergent mixture from the tub. The tub will then be clean and free of odors, mildew, and mold. </p>

<h2>What Should I Expect During the Clean Tub Cycle?</h2>

<p>When the Clean Tub Cycle is running, you may notice some foaming or bubbling in the tub. This is normal and is a sign that the detergent is working to break down and remove any particles that may be present in the tub. </p>

<p>You may also notice a slight smell coming from the washing machine during the cycle. This is also normal and should dissipate once the cycle is complete. </p>
