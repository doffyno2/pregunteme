<p>The loss of a beloved pet can be a devastating experience for any pet owner. For many, the last thing they want to think about is the physical remains of their pet. But, if you decide to have your pet cremated, it is important to know what to expect; including what dog ashes look like.</p>

<p>The ashes of a cremated dog are a combination of bone fragments, fur, and other tissue that have been exposed to extreme heat. The ash is usually a light gray or off-white color and is very fine in texture. Most pet owners find it difficult to recognize their pet’s ashes by sight alone. The best way to identify the ashes of your pet is to have them placed in a memorial urn or other type of container with your pet’s name on it.</p>

<p>The ashes of a cremated dog can vary in size depending on the size of the dog. Smaller dogs usually produce smaller ashes, while larger breeds can leave behind more substantial remains. Many pet owners find that their pets’ ashes are surprisingly light in weight, and can be easily carried in one hand.</p>

<p>When a pet is cremated, the temperature of the chamber can reach up to 1700 degrees Fahrenheit. This intense heat causes the body to break down into its basic elements, leaving behind ashes and a small amount of bone fragments. In some cases, the pet’s collar or tags may also be found in the ashes. This can be a comforting reminder for pet owners who are grieving the loss of their beloved pet.</p>

<p>The process of cremation takes approximately two hours, during which time the pet’s remains are exposed to extreme temperatures. After the cremation is complete, the ashes are placed in an urn or other type of container and returned to the pet owner.
