<p>Creating a projector with a glass cup is a great DIY project for anyone interested in learning how to make a projector without buying expensive equipment. With a few simple supplies, you can easily create a projector that will allow you to watch movies or play video games on a larger screen. This article will provide detailed instructions on how to make a projector with a glass cup, as well as the supplies needed to make the project successful.</p>

<h2>The Supplies Needed to Make a Projector with a Glass Cup</h2>

<p>Before you begin your project, you should gather the supplies needed to make a projector with a glass cup. The supplies you need include: a glass cup, a plastic cup, a magnifying glass, a mirror, an LED flashlight, and a sheet of paper. Additionally, you may want to have a few other supplies such as tape, scissors, and a ruler. Once you have your supplies, you are ready to begin.</p>

<h2>Instructions for Making a Projector with a Glass Cup</h2>

<p>To begin, you will need to make a small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup. Place the magnifying glass in the bottom of the plastic cup and trace around it with a pencil. Cut out the traced circle using scissors and then gently push the magnifying glass through the hole. Place the magnifying glass in the hole and secure it with tape.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to create a stand for the projector. To do this, cut a piece of paper that is approximately two inches wide by four inches long. Fold the paper in half and then fold the two sides so that they meet in the center. Tape the fold in place and then place the paper on the bottom of the plastic cup. This will create a stand for the projector.</p>

<p>Now, place the glass cup upside down on top of the plastic cup. Make sure that the magnifying glass is centered in the glass cup. Place the mirror in the bottom of the glass cup, making sure that it is facing up. Finally, place the LED flashlight in the bottom of the glass cup, making sure that it is pointing up and that the light illuminates the magnifying glass.</p>

<p>Your projector is now ready to use! To watch movies or play video games, simply place the projector on a flat surface and shine the LED flashlight on the magnifying glass. The light will reflect off of the mirror and project the image onto a wall or other flat surface. To adjust the size of the image, simply move the projector closer or farther away from the surface.</p>
