<p>The ProForm bike is one of the most popular bikes on the market today. It is a great machine for getting in shape, and it can be used in many different settings, from the gym to the home. While it is easy to use and navigate, you may find yourself needing to turn it off at some point. Whether it is for safety reasons or just to save energy, here is how to turn off a ProForm bike.</p>

<h2>Turning Off the Monitor</h2>

<p>The next step in turning off your ProForm bike is to turn off the monitor. To do this, locate the “power” button on the monitor, which is usually located at the bottom corner of the screen.
