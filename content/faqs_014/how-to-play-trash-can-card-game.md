<p>The basic rules of the game are simple: each player is dealt a hand of cards, and the goal is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards. As the game progresses, players must discard cards into the “trash can” in order to stay in the game. The last player with cards remaining in their hand is the winner!</p>

<h2>Equipment Needed to Play</h2>

<p>To play Trash Can, you will need a standard deck of 52 playing cards. You can also use jokers if desired. In addition, you will need a “trash can” of some kind, such as a paper bag, box, or bowl. The “trash can” is where players discard their cards.</p>

<h2>How to Set Up the Game</h2>

<p>Once you have all the equipment needed, it’s time to set up the game. Start by shuffling the deck of cards. Then, each player is dealt seven cards. The remaining cards are placed face-down in the center of the playing area. This is the “trash can”.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>Once the cards have been dealt and the “trash can” has been set up, each player has the opportunity to discard one or more cards from their hand. The goal is to discard cards that will not be useful to other players. For example, if you have a pair of jacks, you may choose to discard one of them in order to prevent another player from making a pair.</p>

<p>Once a player has discarded one or more cards, the next player is required to take one of the cards from the “trash can” and add it to their hand. This continues until all of the cards in the “trash can” have been taken. At this point, the last player to take a card from the “trash can” is the winner!</p>
