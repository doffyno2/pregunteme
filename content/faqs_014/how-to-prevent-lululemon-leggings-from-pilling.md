<p>Lululemon leggings are perfect for exercising, running errands, or just lounging around the house. The problem is, after a few wears, they can start to look worn and old. This is because of pilling, which is the formation of small balls of fabric that stick to the leggings. It’s not only unsightly, but it can also make the fabric feel uncomfortable. But don’t worry – there are some easy ways to prevent pilling so your leggings can look as good as new for longer.</p>

<h2>1. Choose the Right Fabric</h2>

<p>The first step in preventing pilling is to choose the right fabric in the first place. Synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon are more prone to pilling than natural fabrics like cotton and wool. If you’re going to invest in a pair of Lululemon leggings, make sure to check the fabric content. Natural fabrics are usually better for avoiding pilling, but they might not be as comfortable for exercising.</p>

<h2>2. Wash with Care</h2>

<p>Proper care and maintenance is key to preventing pilling. Always follow the care instructions on the label, but in general, it’s best to wash your Lululemon leggings in cold water and hang them to dry. Avoid using fabric softeners and detergents with bleach, as these can weaken the fibers and make them more prone to pilling. You should also avoid drying your leggings in the dryer, as the heat can cause pilling.</p>

<h2>3. Avoid Abrasive Fabrics</h2>

<p>When wearing your Lululemon leggings, avoid contact with abrasive fabrics like denim. The friction between the two fabrics can cause the leggings to pill. It’s also a good idea to avoid wearing them with jewelry or other accessories that can snag the fabric. If you’re going to be wearing them for a long period of time, it’s a good idea to wear a light layer of clothing over them to protect them from abrasion.</p>

<h2>4. Remove Pills Immediately</h2>

<p>If you notice any pilling on your Lululemon leggings, don’t wait until it gets worse. Use a fabric shaver or pilling comb to remove the pills as soon as possible. You can also try using a lint roller or adhesive tape to remove the pills. Be careful not to pull on the fabric, as it could cause it to stretch or tear.</p>

<h2>5. Store Them Properly</h2>

<p>When you’re not wearing your Lululemon leggings, make sure to store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing them in direct sunlight or in a damp area, as this can cause the fabric to break down and become more prone to pilling. Additionally, make sure to hang them up instead of folding them, as folding can cause creases that can lead to pilling.</p>
