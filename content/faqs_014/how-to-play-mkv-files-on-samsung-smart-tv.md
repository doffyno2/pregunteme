<p>MKV file format is one of the most popular video formats used for storing full HD videos. It is a container format that can contain multiple video and audio streams, subtitles and other meta data. With such a wide range of features, MKV files are now supported by most media players and streaming services. But unfortunately, Samsung Smart TVs do not natively support the MKV file format. So if you want to play MKV files on your Samsung Smart TV, you will need to use a third-party app or device to do so.</p>

<h2>What Is an MKV File?</h2>

<p>MKV stands for ‘Matroska Video’. It is an open source, container format developed by the Matroska foundation to store full HD videos. It is a popular file format for HD movies and TV shows, as it contains multiple video and audio streams, subtitles, chapters, and other meta data.</p>

<p>MKV files are also capable of storing 4K videos, which makes them an ideal format for storing large video files. Another great feature of MKV files is that they can be streamed over the internet, as long as the player supports the MKV format.</p>

<h2>Why Can’t I Play MKV Files on My Samsung Smart TV?</h2>

<p>The most common reason why you cannot play MKV files on your Samsung Smart TV is because the TV does not natively support the MKV file format. This means that the TV does not recognize the MKV file as a valid video file and thus cannot play it.</p>

<p>Another reason why you may not be able to play MKV files on your Samsung Smart TV is if the TV does not have sufficient hardware to decode the MKV file. MKV files are usually encoded using the H.264 or H.265 codec, which requires a powerful processor in order to decode the file.

<h2>How to Play MKV Files on Samsung Smart TV</h2>

<p>Fortunately, there are several ways that you can play MKV files on your Samsung Smart TV. The simplest way is to use a third-party media player app such as VLC or Plex. These apps are available for download from the Samsung Smart Hub and can be used to play MKV files on your Samsung Smart TV.</p>

<p>Another way to play MKV files on your Samsung Smart TV is to use a media streaming device such as the Apple TV or Google Chromecast. These devices are designed to stream media from your computer or mobile device to your TV, and they support the MKV file format. All you need to do is connect the device to your TV and then stream the MKV file from your computer or mobile device.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also connect an external hard drive to your Samsung Smart TV and play the MKV files directly from the drive. This is the simplest way to play MKV files on your Samsung Smart TV, as it requires no additional software or hardware.</p>
