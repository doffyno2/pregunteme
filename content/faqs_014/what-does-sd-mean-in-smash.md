Smash is a fighting game franchise created by Nintendo and released for multiple gaming systems including the Nintendo 64, GameCube, Wii, and Wii U. It is a highly competitive game that requires players to master a variety of techniques and strategies to succeed. The game is divided into two main categories: Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee. Each game has its own unique set of rules and mechanics, but they all share the same goal: to knock your opponents out of the arena.

One of the most important aspects of the Smash franchise is the terminology. Many terms are used to describe various aspects of the game, including SD, which stands for Self Destruct.
