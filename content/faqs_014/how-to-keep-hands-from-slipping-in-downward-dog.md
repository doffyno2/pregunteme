<p>Downward Dog is one of the most popular poses in yoga, and for good reason. It stretches out the legs, strengthens the arms, and helps to open up the shoulders and chest. But this pose can also be challenging due to the risk of your hands slipping on the mat or your feet slipping in the air. If you want to get the most out of your Downward Dog, here are some tips to help you keep your hands and feet from slipping.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Yoga Mat</h2>

<p>The first step to keeping your hands from slipping in Downward Dog is to choose the right yoga mat. A good yoga mat will have a firm grip that helps to keep your hands and feet from sliding. Look for mats that have a textured surface and a rubber or foam backing. These materials will help to grip the floor and provide you with extra stability. You may also want to consider getting a mat with a non-slip surface, which will help to keep your feet from slipping in the air.</p>

<h2>Keep Your Hands Dry</h2>

<p>Another important tip to keep your hands from slipping in Downward Dog is to keep them dry. Sweaty palms can make it difficult to maintain a grip on the mat. To avoid this, make sure you wipe your hands off with a towel before you start your practice. You can also use a yoga mat spray or a non-slip grip spray to help keep your hands dry and give you a better grip on the mat.</p>

<h2>Practice Proper Alignment</h2>

<p>Proper alignment is key to keeping your hands from slipping in Downward Dog. Make sure your hands are spread out evenly on the mat and that your fingers are spread wide. Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart and your palms should be firmly pressed down into the mat. This will help to keep your hands from slipping and provide you with more stability.</p>

<h2>Pay Attention to Your Feet</h2>

<p>Your feet can also be a source of slipping in Downward Dog. To avoid this, make sure your feet are firmly planted on the floor and that your toes are spread wide. You should also be aware of your weight distribution and make sure that your weight is evenly distributed between your hands and feet.</p>

<p>Focusing on your breath is also important for keeping your hands from slipping in Downward Dog. Taking deep, slow breaths will help to relax your body and calm your mind. This will help to reduce any tension in your body and make it easier to maintain your grip on the mat.</p>
