<p>Original fitment is a term used to describe the exact type of tire that is recommended for a specific vehicle. It can refer to the size and type of tire, as well as the type of rim that is recommended for the vehicle. In some cases, original fitment may refer to the exact brand of tire recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.</p>

<p>When purchasing tires, it is important to understand that the original fitment recommended by the vehicle manufacturer is the best choice for the vehicle. This is because original fitment tires are designed to provide the most optimal performance for the vehicle in question. The size, type, and construction of the tire are all taken into consideration when choosing the best original fitment for a particular vehicle.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways that one can determine the original fitment for their vehicle. The first is by consulting the vehicle's owner's manual. This manual will have a section dedicated to tires, which will provide information on the recommended original fitment for the vehicle in question.

It is important to research the various tire brands and types available and determine which tire is best suited for the vehicle in question. In addition, it is important to consider the driving conditions in which the vehicle will be used.</p>

<p>In addition to the original fitment, it is also important to consider the type of rims that are recommended for the vehicle. Different vehicles will require different types of rims in order to ensure optimal performance. For example, a vehicle that is used primarily on highways may require a different type of rim than a vehicle that is used primarily off-road. It is important to research the various types of rims available and determine which type is best suited for the vehicle in question.</p>
