<p>Are you having problems with your Hotpoint gas stove? If so, then you may be having difficulty lighting your pilot light. This can be a frustrating experience, as it is important to make sure the pilot light is lit in order to ensure that your stove is working properly. Fortunately, this process is not difficult and can be completed in just a few steps.</p>

<h2>Step One: Locate the Pilot</h2>

<p>The first step in lighting the pilot light on your Hotpoint gas stove is to locate the pilot. This is a small, round piece of metal located behind the oven door. Once you have located the pilot, you will need to turn off the power to the stove. This can be done by flipping the switch located on the back of the stove.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Open the Oven Door</h2>

<p>Once the power is off, you will need to open the oven door in order to access the pilot. This can be done by pressing the oven door latch and pulling the door open. Once the door is open, you should be able to see the pilot.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Light the Pilot</h2>

<p>Now that you have located the pilot, you can begin the process of actually lighting the pilot. To do this, you will need to use a match or a lighter. Hold the match or lighter up to the pilot and strike it. This should cause the pilot to ignite. Once the pilot is lit, you will need to keep the match or lighter in place for a few seconds in order to keep the flame burning. After a few seconds, you will be able to remove the match or lighter and the pilot will stay lit.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Turn the Gas Back On</h2>

<p>Once the pilot is lit, you will need to turn the gas back on. This can be done by flipping the switch located on the back of the stove. Once the gas is turned back on, you should be able to use your stove as normal.</p>
