When it comes to outdoor apparel, North Face is one of the most popular brands. Their fleece jackets, pants and other items are incredibly comfortable and stylish, but they require special care to keep them soft and looking their best. In this article, we’ll explore the best ways to wash North Face fleece and keep it soft and clean.

<h2>Why Does North Face Fleece Need Special Care?</h2>

North Face fleece is made of a special type of synthetic fabric that is designed to be lightweight, breathable and warm. This fabric is sensitive to heat, so it needs to be washed in cold water and dried on a low setting. If you don’t take the right steps, the fabric can become stiff and brittle, which can ruin its look and feel. It’s important to treat North Face fleece with care to keep it soft and looking its best.

<h2>How to Wash North Face Fleece</h2>

Washing North Face fleece is a relatively simple process. Here are the steps you should take:

<h3>Step 1: Read the Care Label</h3>

Before you wash your North Face fleece, be sure to read the care label. This will tell you the best way to wash and dry your garment. It’s especially important to pay attention to the drying instructions, as this will help keep your fleece soft and looking its best.

<h3>Step 2: Machine Wash on a Gentle Cycle</h3>

Once you’ve read the care label, you can machine wash your North Face fleece on a gentle cycle. Be sure to use only cold water and a gentle detergent that is specifically designed for delicate fabrics. Do not use fabric softener or bleach.

<h3>Step 3: Air Dry or Dry on Low Heat</h3>

Once you’ve washed your North Face fleece, you can either air dry it or dry it on a low heat setting. If you choose to use a dryer, be sure to check the care label for the appropriate temperature setting. Avoid using a high heat setting, as this can cause the fabric to shrink and become stiff and brittle.

<h2>How to Keep North Face Fleece Soft</h2>

In addition to washing your North Face fleece correctly, there are a few other steps you can take to keep it soft. Here are a few tips:

<h3>Tip 1: Avoid Over-Drying</h3>

When drying your North Face fleece, be sure not to over-dry it. This can cause the fabric to become stiff and brittle. It’s best to take it out of the dryer when it is still slightly damp and then lay it flat to finish air drying.

<h3>Tip 2: Store Properly</h3>

When you’re not wearing your North Face fleece, be sure to store it properly. Keep it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. This will help keep the fabric from fading or becoming brittle.

<h3>Tip 3: Refresh in the Dryer</h3>

If your North Face fleece has become stiff or wrinkled, you can refresh it in the dryer. Put it in the dryer on a low heat setting for 10-15 minutes. This should help bring back its softness and fluffiness.
