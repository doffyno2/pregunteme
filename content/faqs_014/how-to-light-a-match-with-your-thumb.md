<p>Lighting a match with your thumb is a great way to show off your skills when you’re out with friends, or just looking to impress someone. It’s a relatively easy trick to learn, and once you’ve mastered it, you’ll be able to perform it whenever you need to. Here’s how to light a match with your thumb in no time.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Match</h2>

<p>The first step in lighting a match with your thumb is to prepare the match itself. Start by taking the match and bending it in half so that the match head is sticking out of one end. Make sure to bend it slightly so that the match head is still visible.</p>
