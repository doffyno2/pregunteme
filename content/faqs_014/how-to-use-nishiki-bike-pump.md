<p>Having a bike pump is essential if you want to make sure your bike tires are always at the right pressure. It’s a piece of equipment that can quickly inflate or deflate your tires, depending on the situation. If you’re looking for a reliable bike pump, the Nishiki bike pump is a great option. Read on to learn how to use a Nishiki bike pump and the benefits it offers.</p>

<h2>Types of Bike Pumps</h2>

If your bike has a Presta valve, attach the Presta head to the pump first. If your bike has a Schrader valve, attach the Schrader head to the pump.</p>

<p>Next, unscrew the valve on the bike tire, remove the valve core, and attach the pump head. Once the pump head is connected, pump the handle up and down until the tire reaches the desired pressure. You can check the pressure with the built-in pressure gauge on the Nishiki bike pump. When you’re finished, unscrew the pump head, replace the valve core, and screw the valve back in place.</p>
