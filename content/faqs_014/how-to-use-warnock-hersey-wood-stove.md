<p>Using a Warnock Hersey wood stove is not only a great way to heat your home, but also an economical one. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about how to use a Warnock Hersey wood stove, from what type of fuel to use, to how to light it and maintain it. With the right knowledge, you can ensure that you get the most out of your stove and stay safe while doing it.</p>

<h2>What Type of Fuel to Use</h2>

<p>Warnock Hersey wood stoves are designed to be used with dry, well-seasoned hardwood. Softwoods like pine, fir, and spruce should not be used because they contain higher levels of sap and creosote, both of which can be dangerous when burned in a wood stove. The best type of wood for a wood stove is hardwood, such as oak, maple, beech, and ash. These types of wood are dense and will burn longer and provide more heat than softer woods.</p>

<p>It is important to make sure that the wood you use is dry and well-seasoned. Wood that is not dry enough will not burn as hot or as efficiently as dry wood. The best way to tell if wood is dry enough is by checking the moisture content. Wood that has a moisture content of 20% or less is considered to be dry enough for use in a wood stove.</p>

<h2>How to Light the Stove</h2>

<p>When lighting a Warnock Hersey wood stove, it is important to use the correct materials and techniques. You will need some kindling, newspaper, and matches. Begin by placing some small pieces of kindling in the firebox, followed by a few sheets of crumpled newspaper. Light the newspaper and allow the kindling to catch fire. Once the kindling is burning, you can add larger pieces of wood.</p>

<p>When adding the larger pieces of wood, be sure to place them in an even layer and leave a gap between each piece. This will allow the fire to burn more efficiently and will also increase the heat output. Once the larger pieces of wood are in place, you can close the damper and adjust the air intake to control the fire.</p>

<h2>Maintaining The Stove</h2>

<p>It is important to keep your Warnock Hersey wood stove clean and properly maintained to ensure that it is working properly and efficiently. The stove should be inspected regularly to check for any signs of damage or wear. It is also important to clean the firebox and chimney regularly to remove any creosote buildup. Creosote is a highly flammable substance that can cause chimney fires if it is not removed. A professional chimney sweep can help to clean the chimney and make sure that it is safe.</p>

<p>It is also important to make sure that the air intake and flue are operating properly. The air intake should be adjusted to allow for a good draft and the flue should be checked for any blockages. If there are any blockages, they should be removed to allow for a proper flow of air and smoke.</p>
