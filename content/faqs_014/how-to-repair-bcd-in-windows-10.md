<p>A Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store is a database that contains boot-time configuration information, including system startup options and hardware settings. When a PC starts, Windows 10 uses the BCD to determine which operating system it should boot into, and then it loads the operating system and its related files. If the BCD gets corrupted, it can cause the computer to fail to boot into Windows 10, or cause errors that prevent Windows 10 from loading properly. In this article, we will explain how to repair BCD in Windows 10.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Corrupted BCD?</h2>

<p>A corrupted BCD can be caused by a variety of things, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Upgrading from an earlier version of Windows 10 to a newer version</li>
  <li>Installing a new operating system</li>
  <li>Installing or uninstalling software</li>
  <li>Changing hardware settings</li>
</ul>

<p>If the BCD becomes corrupted, it can cause the computer to fail to boot into Windows 10, or cause errors that prevent Windows 10 from loading properly. It is important to know how to repair a corrupted BCD in order to prevent these issues from occurring.</p>

<h2>How to Repair BCD in Windows 10</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a corrupted BCD is to open the Command Prompt. To do this, press the <b>Windows</b> key + <b>X</b> and select <b>Command Prompt (Admin)</b> from the menu. Once the Command Prompt has opened, type <b>bootrec</b> and then press <b>Enter</b>. This will bring up a list of options.</p>

<p>The next step is to type <b>bootrec /rebuildbcd</b> and then press <b>Enter</b>. This will start the process of rebuilding the BCD. The process may take some time, so be patient. Once it is finished, you should see a message that says “The operation completed successfully.” This means that the BCD has been successfully rebuilt.</p>

<p>The last step is to type <b>bootrec /fixmbr</b> and then press <b>Enter</b>. This will start the process of repairing the Master Boot Record (MBR). Once the process is complete, you should see a message that says “The operation completed successfully.” This means that the MBR has been successfully repaired.</p>

<p>Now that you have repaired the BCD and MBR, you should be able to boot into Windows 10 without any issues. If you still have problems, you may need to perform a clean install of Windows 10.</p>
