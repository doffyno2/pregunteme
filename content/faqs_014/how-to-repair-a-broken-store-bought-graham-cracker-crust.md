<p>A broken graham cracker crust can be a huge disappointment when you’re trying to make a delicious dessert. Fortunately, there are some simple ways to salvage a broken graham cracker crust and put it back together again. With a few easy steps, you can repair a broken graham cracker crust and get it back to its original form.</p>

<h2>Gather the Crumbs</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a broken graham cracker crust is to gather all the crumbs. Use a spoon to collect the crumbs from the bottom of the pan. Place them in a bowl or on a plate.</p>

<h2>Mix the Crumbs with Butter</h2>

<p>Once the crumbs have been gathered, you will need to mix them with melted butter. Use a fork to mix the melted butter and the graham cracker crumbs together until they form a thick paste. This will act as the “glue” for the crust.</p>

<h2>Press the Crumb Mixture into the Pan</h2>

<p>Next, press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the pan. Make sure to press it down evenly and firmly so that it sticks together. If you find that the crumb mixture is too dry, you can add a little bit more melted butter to help it stick together.</p>

<h2>Bake the Crust</h2>

<p>Once you have pressed the crumb mixture into the pan, you will need to bake it in the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F and bake the crust for 15 minutes. Once it is done baking, let it cool before adding your filling.</p>

<h2>Filling the Crust</h2>

<p>When the crust is finished baking and has cooled, you can then add the filling. Use your favorite recipe for the filling, or you can use a store-bought pre-made filling. Spread the filling evenly over the crust and refrigerate it until it is firm.</p>

<h2>Decorate the Crust</h2>

<p>Once the filling has been added and has set, you can then decorate the top of the crust. This can be done with a variety of toppings such as whipped cream, chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or sprinkles. You can also drizzle melted chocolate over the top of the crust for a finishing touch.</p>
