<p>Ham is one of the most popular dishes across the world, and baking it is one of the most common ways to prepare it. But have you ever wondered how to tent a ham with foil after baking? </p>

<p>Tenting a ham with foil after baking helps keep it moist and retain its flavor. It also helps keep the surface of the ham from getting too dry or burned. The process of tenting a ham with foil is fairly simple and requires little effort. Hereâ€™s how to do it:</p>

<h2>Ingredients and Supplies Needed</h2>

<p>To tent a ham with foil after baking, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ham</li>
  <li>Foil</li>
  <li>Sharp knife</li>
  <li>Baking pan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h2>

<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the ham in a baking pan and bake for 30 minutes per pound or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Let the Ham Rest</h2>

<p>When the ham is cooked through, remove it from the oven and let it rest for at least 15 minutes before tenting it with foil.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Tent the Ham</h2>

<p>Once the ham has rested, use a sharp knife to cut off any excess fat. Then, use a long piece of foil to tent the ham. The foil should be stretched over the top of the ham and tucked under the sides of the baking pan. This will help keep the moisture in and keep the ham from becoming too dry or burned.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Store the Ham</h2>

<p>Once the ham is tented with foil, it can be stored in the refrigerator. If the ham is not going to be eaten within a few days, it should be stored in the freezer. The foil will help keep the ham moist and prevent it from drying out.</p>
