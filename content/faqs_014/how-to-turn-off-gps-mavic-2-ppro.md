<p>The Mavic 2 Pro is one of the most popular drones on the market. It is a great choice for both professional and amateur drone operators. One of the features that makes the Mavic 2 Pro so attractive is its built-in GPS navigation capabilities. This GPS system allows the Mavic 2 Pro to navigate and remain in the air autonomously. However, this feature can be turned off if desired. In this article, we will explain how to turn off the GPS on the Mavic 2 Pro.</p> 

<h2>What Is GPS?</h2>

<p>GPS stands for Global Positioning System. This system uses a network of satellites to determine the exact position of an object. It is used in everything from cars to airplanes to drones. The GPS on the Mavic 2 Pro is used to help the drone navigate and stay in the air without any input from the user. </p>

<h2>Why Turn Off GPS?</h2>

<p>Although the GPS on the Mavic 2 Pro is useful for navigation, there are some situations where it is better to turn it off. For example, if you are flying in an area with a lot of interference from other GPS signals, you may want to turn off the GPS. This will help the drone stay in the air without any interference from other signals. Additionally, turning off the GPS can also help save battery life.</p>

<h2>How To Turn Off GPS</h2>

<p>Turning off the GPS on the Mavic 2 Pro is a simple process. First, power on the drone and connect it to your controller. Once the drone is connected, open the DJI Go 4 app on your mobile device. On the left-hand side of the app, select the “Camera” icon. Once you are in the Camera settings, locate the “GPS” option and switch it to “Off.” The GPS will now be turned off and the drone will no longer be able to navigate autonomously.</p>
