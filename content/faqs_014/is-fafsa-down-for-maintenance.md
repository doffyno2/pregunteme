<p>For most college students, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a crucial part of the college application process. Without FAFSA, students wouldn’t be able to receive financial aid and grants from the federal government. So, when FAFSA goes down for maintenance, it can cause a massive disruption for students who are working on applying for financial aid. Fortunately, there are some steps students can take to ensure that they can still submit their FAFSA and receive the financial aid they need.</p>

<h2>What is FAFSA and What Does it Do?</h2>

<p>FAFSA is the online application that students fill out to receive financial aid from the federal government. This includes grants, scholarships, and student loans. The FAFSA is used to calculate a student’s eligibility for federal student aid, and it is also used to determine the amount of aid a student can receive. It is important for students to fill out their FAFSA as soon as possible, as most schools have a certain amount of funds that are allocated for financial aid, and the funds are given out on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<h2>Why Does FAFSA Go Down for Maintenance?</h2>

<p>In order to ensure that the FAFSA website is running smoothly and that the information is secure, the website undergoes routine maintenance. This is usually done during off-peak times, such as late at night or early in the morning. However, sometimes the website will go down unexpectedly due to technical issues or other unforeseen circumstances. When this happens, the website will be temporarily unavailable.</p>

<h2>What Should I Do if FAFSA is Down for Maintenance?</h2>

<p>If FAFSA is down for maintenance, the best thing to do is to contact your college’s financial aid office. The financial aid office will be able to provide more information about the maintenance and when the website will be back up and running. In the meantime, you can still work on filling out the application and preparing the documents that are needed to submit your FAFSA. You may also want to call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) for more information.</p>

<h2>What if I Can’t Submit My FAFSA in Time?</h2>

<p>If you can’t submit your FAFSA in time due to FAFSA being down for maintenance, don’t panic. You can still submit your FAFSA after the deadline, but you may not receive your financial aid as quickly. Contact your college’s financial aid office to find out what options are available to you. They may be able to help you expedite the process or provide you with other forms of assistance.</p>

<h2>Are There Other Resources Available?</h2>

<p>In addition to the FAFSA, there are other resources available to help you save money on college. You may want to consider applying for scholarships or grants from private organizations or your state government. You can also look into student loan repayment programs or consider taking out a private loan. There are also a number of tax credits and deductions that may be available to you.</p>
