<p>Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game is set in the year 2281, four years after the events of Fallout 3, and takes place in the Mojave Desert around the city of Las Vegas. It is the fourth main game in the Fallout series. Players take control of a character known as the Courier, who is tasked with delivering a mysterious package to the city of New Vegas.</p>

<p>One of the earliest missions in the game is to locate a man named Benny, who is hiding out in a tent in the Crimson Caravan Company. The player is tasked with killing Benny, but there is another option – the player can leave Benny in the tent, unharmed. This choice has a major impact on the game’s story and can have long-term consequences. So, what if you left Benny in the tent in Fallout: New Vegas?</p>

<h2>The Consequences of Leaving Benny in the Tent</h2>

<p>Leaving Benny in the tent has a number of consequences. First, it will change the way the game’s story progresses. Without Benny to fight, the player will have to face his allies, the Van Graffs, alone. This can make the mission more difficult, as the Van Graffs are well-armed and powerful adversaries. It also means that the player will not receive Benny’s reward for killing him – a suit of armor known as the Lucky 38. This armor can provide significant protection in some of the game’s more dangerous areas.</p>

<p>The second consequence of leaving Benny in the tent is that the player will be unable to complete the mission “Wild Card: Change in Management”. This mission requires the player to kill Benny in order to gain access to the Lucky 38 casino. If the player leaves Benny alive, they will be unable to complete the mission and will miss out on the rewards it provides. The mission also has an impact on the game’s ending, as it unlocks several potential endings.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Leaving Benny in the Tent</h2>

<p>Despite the consequences of leaving Benny in the tent, there are also some benefits. One of these is the fact that the player will be able to complete the mission “For the Republic, Part 2” without having to kill Benny. This mission requires the player to deliver a package to the Crimson Caravan, and leaving Benny alive will allow them to do so without a fight. Completing this mission will also unlock several potential endings.</p>

<p>The other benefit of leaving Benny in the tent is that the player will be able to access the Lucky 38 casino without having to kill him. This is because, in addition to the mission “Wild Card: Change in Management”, there is another way to gain access to the casino – by completing a side quest known as “That Lucky Old Sun”. Completing this quest will grant the player access to the casino, and they will be able to explore its many features without having to kill Benny.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Leaving Benny in the tent in Fallout: New Vegas can have a major impact on the game’s story and can have long-term consequences. It will change the way the game’s story progresses and will prevent the player from completing certain missions. On the other hand, it will also allow the player to access the Lucky 38 casino without having to kill Benny and will enable them to complete the mission “For the Republic, Part 2” without a fight. Ultimately, the decision to leave Benny in the tent is up to the player and it is one that should be considered carefully. </p>
