Natto is a traditional Japanese dish made from fermented soybeans. It has a distinct, sticky texture and a strong, pungent flavor. Its unique taste and texture make it an acquired taste, but it has many health benefits. Natto is high in protein, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, making it an excellent food choice for those looking to improve their diet. In Japan, it is traditionally served over steamed rice or as part of a bento box. 

Natto can be purchased in frozen form, which is an easy and convenient way to enjoy this nutritious dish. However, there are some important steps to take when preparing frozen natto in order to ensure that it is properly cooked and enjoyable. 

<h2>Using Frozen Natto</h2>

Frozen natto is a great way to enjoy natto without having to ferment it yourself. It can be found in most Asian supermarkets and is usually sold in individual packages. It is usually already cooked and prepared, so it is ready to eat. 

When using frozen natto, it is important to remember that it needs to be thawed before it can be used. The best way to do this is to place the frozen natto in a bowl of cold water for about 30 minutes. This will help to thaw the natto without making it too soggy. 

<h2>Preparing Frozen Natto</h2>

Once the frozen natto has been thawed, it is time to prepare it for consumption. This involves adding any desired seasonings and condiments to the natto before cooking. The most common way to season frozen natto is to add soy sauce, mirin, and a dashi stock cube. This will help to enhance the flavor and make the natto more enjoyable. 

Once the seasonings have been added, the natto can be cooked. The easiest way to do this is to place the natto in a steamer and steam it for 10-15 minutes. If a steamer is not available, the natto can be cooked in a pot of boiling water for 10-15 minutes. 

<h2>Serving Frozen Natto</h2>

Once the natto has been cooked, it is ready to be served. Natto is usually served over steamed rice, but it can also be eaten on its own. It can also be added to a bento box, or served as part of a larger meal. 

When serving frozen natto, it is important to remember that it is best enjoyed warm. If the natto has been refrigerated, it should be reheated in the microwave for a few minutes before serving. 

<h2>Storing Frozen Natto</h2>

Frozen natto can be stored in the freezer for up to three months. It should be stored in an airtight container or zip-top bag to prevent freezer burn. It should also be labeled with the date of purchase so that it can be easily identified. 

When storing frozen natto, it is important to remember that it should not be refrozen after it has been thawed. After thawing, the natto should be cooked and consumed within a few days.
