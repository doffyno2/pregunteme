<p>Itching can be a frustrating and uncomfortable sensation. When a scab itches, it can be even more annoying, as scratching it can cause it to become inflamed and may even lead to an infection. Fortunately, there are a few simple ways to make a scab stop itching. </p>

<h2>What Causes a Scab to Itch?</h2>

<p>Scabs are a natural part of the healing process. They form when the body produces a protective layer of cells to cover a wound. This layer of cells seals the wound and keeps germs and dirt out. In some cases, this protective layer of cells may also cause itching. </p>

<p>The itching can occur when the body is healing or when the scab becomes dry. In some cases, a scab may be itchy because it contains bacteria, which can irritate the skin and cause an itching sensation. </p>

<h2>How to Make a Scab Stop Itching</h2>

<p>There are several ways to make a scab stop itching. The first is to keep the area clean and dry. This will help to prevent bacteria from accumulating on the scab and irritating the skin. It is also important to avoid scratching the scab, as this can cause further irritation and may even lead to infection. </p>

<p>It is also important to use an antiseptic ointment or cream on the scab. This will help to reduce itching and also help to prevent infection. If the scab is particularly itchy, an anti-itch cream may also be helpful. </p>

<p>It is also important to keep the area moisturized. This can be done by applying a light layer of petroleum jelly or a moisturizing lotion. This will help to keep the scab from drying out and becoming itchy. </p>

<p>Finally, it is important to keep the area covered. Wearing loose fitting clothing can help to keep the scab from becoming itchy. Additionally, wearing gloves can help to protect the skin from further irritation. </p>

<h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
