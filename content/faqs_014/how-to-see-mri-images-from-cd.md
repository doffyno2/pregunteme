<h2>What is an MRI? </h2>

An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan is a type of diagnostic test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the body's internal organs and structures. An MRI can be used to diagnose many conditions, including cancers, heart and vascular diseases, musculoskeletal problems, and neurological disorders. The detailed images help doctors diagnose and monitor a wide range of diseases and injuries.

<h2>How Does an MRI Work? </h2>

An MRI machine is made up of a powerful magnet and a radio frequency transmitter. The magnet creates a strong magnetic field that interacts with the body's tissues and organs. Radio waves are then sent through the body, creating a signal that is picked up by the MRI machine. The MRI machine then uses this signal to create detailed images of the body's structures and organs.
