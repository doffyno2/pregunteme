<p>This War of Mine is a survival game that puts you in the shoes of a group of civilians, struggling to survive in a war-torn city. Your goal is to survive each day, while scavenging for resources and food. One of the most important resources is your backpack, which you can upgrade with different items. Here’s how to upgrade your backpack in This War of Mine.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Your Backpack with Crafted Items</h2>

<p>You can upgrade your backpack by crafting items. Crafting items will help you to increase the size of your backpack. To craft items, you’ll need to gather materials from scavenging missions.

<ul>
  <li>10 pieces of cloth</li>
  <li>1 leather belt</li>
  <li>1 metal sheet</li>
  <li>2 metal poles</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have the materials, you’ll need to craft them at the workbench. When you craft a backpack upgrade, it will increase the size of your backpack by one slot. You can repeat this process until your backpack is as large as you need it to be.</p>
