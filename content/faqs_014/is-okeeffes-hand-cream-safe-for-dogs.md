<p>When it comes to the health and well-being of our four-legged friends, it’s important to be aware of the products we use and how they may affect our pets. O’Keeffe’s Working Hands Hand Cream is a common product used by many to soothe cracked or dry skin. But is it safe to use on dogs?</p>

<p>The short answer is yes, O’Keeffe’s Working Hands Hand Cream is safe for use on dogs, but it should never be used on cats. The main ingredient in the cream is glycerin, which is found in many skin care products. It is a humectant, meaning it helps to retain moisture in the skin. While it is safe for use on dogs, it should not be used on cats as they are more sensitive to the effects of glycerin.</p>

<p>The other main ingredient in O’Keeffe’s Working Hands Hand Cream is lanolin, which is derived from sheep’s wool. It is a natural moisturizer that is safe for use on dogs, but again, should not be used on cats. It is important to note that lanolin can be irritating to some dogs, so it’s best to test a small amount of the product on a patch of skin before applying it to your dog.</p>

<p>O’Keeffe’s Working Hands Hand Cream is designed to be used on human skin, so it is not specifically formulated for use on animals. However, it can be used on dogs to help soothe and moisturize dry, cracked skin. It is important to note that the cream should never be used on cats.
