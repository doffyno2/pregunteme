However, there are certain times when a Prius owner may need to reset the maintenance light, which is an important part of keeping the car running smoothly. In this article, we will explain how to reset the maintenance light on a 2015 Toyota Prius. </p>

<h2>What is the Maintenance Light?</h2>

<p>The maintenance light, also known as the “idiot light”, is an indicator light that is located on the dashboard of your 2015 Toyota Prius. It is designed to inform the driver when the car needs to be serviced or when certain parts need to be replaced. The maintenance light is usually illuminated when the car needs an oil change, a tire rotation, or other routine maintenance. </p>

<h2>How to Reset the Maintenance Light on a 2015 Toyota Prius</h2>

<p>Resetting the maintenance light on a 2015 Toyota Prius is a fairly simple process. All you need to do is follow these steps:</p>

    <li>Turn the ignition key to the “On” position, but do not start the engine. </li>
    <li>Press and hold the “Trip/Reset” button.</li>
    <li>Continue to hold the button until the maintenance light turns off. </li>
