<h2>What Causes Dashboard Scratches</h2>

<p>Dashboard scratches can be caused by a number of things, from everyday use of the car to accidental damage.

<h2>How To Repair Car Dashboard Scratches</h2>

<p>Although dashboard scratches can be difficult to repair, there are a few simple steps you can take to fix them. Here are some tips for repairing car dashboard scratches:</p>

<h3>1. Clean The Dashboard</h3>
