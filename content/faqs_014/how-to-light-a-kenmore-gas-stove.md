<p>Do you have a Kenmore gas stove and are unsure how to light it? We’ll walk you through the steps so you can start cooking safely and efficiently. Read on for instructions on how to light a Kenmore gas stove.</p>

<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>

<p>You won’t need much to light your Kenmore gas stove, just the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strike-anywhere matches</li>
  <li>A long-handled lighter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety First</h2>

<p>Before you light your Kenmore gas stove, it’s important to remember safety first. Make sure you’ve opened any windows or doors in the kitchen to ensure proper ventilation. In addition, make sure the room is free of any combustible materials. This includes fabrics, paper, and any other flammable materials. Finally, make sure you’re wearing clothing that can’t catch fire and be sure to remove any jewelry that could spark when you’re lighting the stove.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Turn on the Gas</h2>

<p>The first step in learning how to light a Kenmore gas stove is to make sure the gas is on. Turn the knob on the stove to the “on” position. You should hear a hissing sound as the gas is released. If you don’t hear any hissing, make sure the gas line is connected properly and that the settings on the stove are correct.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Ignite the Gas</h2>

<p>When the gas is on, you can ignite it by using strike-anywhere matches or a long-handled lighter. Hold the match or lighter about an inch away from the burner and then turn the knob to the “ignite” position. You should see a spark and then hear a “whoosh” as the gas ignites. If the gas does not ignite, turn the knob to the “off” position, wait a few minutes, and then try again.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Flame</h2>

<p>Once the gas has ignited, you can adjust the flame. Turn the knob to the desired flame size. The flame should be steady and blue. If it’s yellow or orange, there may be a problem with the gas line or the stove. If that’s the case, turn the knob to the “off” position, wait a few minutes, and then try again.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Monitor the Flame</h2>

<p>Once you’ve lit the Kenmore gas stove and adjusted the flame, it’s important to monitor it. Make sure the flame doesn’t go out and that it stays at the desired size. If the flame goes out, turn the knob to the “off” position and then try to light it again.</p>
