<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

<p>Before you begin tightening your go kart chain, make sure you have the right tools. You’ll need a breaker bar, a torque wrench, and a pair of pliers. If you don’t have access to these tools, you can purchase them from your local hardware store. </p>

<h2>Step 1: Loosen the Chain</h2>
