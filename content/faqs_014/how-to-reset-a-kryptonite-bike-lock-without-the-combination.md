<p>Whether you've forgotten the combination to your Kryptonite bike lock or you've simply lost the key, there are ways to reset the lock without having to break it or use a locksmith. Resetting a Kryptonite bike lock is an easy task as long as you know the right steps to follow. Read on to find out how.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<p>Before you get started, you'll need a few supplies: a flathead screwdriver, a Phillips-head screwdriver, and a paperclip. If you don't have the appropriate screwdrivers, you can purchase them from your local hardware store.</p>

<h2>Steps to Resetting the Lock</h2>

<p>To reset the lock, follow these steps:</p>

<h3>1. Unscrew the Casing</h3>

<p>Using the flathead screwdriver, carefully unscrew the casing of the lock. Be gentle when doing this as you don't want to damage the lock.</p>

<h3>2. Locate the Reset Button</h3>

<p>Once you have the casing off, you should be able to locate the reset button. It's usually located on the side of the lock, near the number dial.</p>

<h3>3. Press the Reset Button</h3>

<p>Using the Phillips-head screwdriver, press the reset button. You should hear a "click" once the button is pressed.</p>

<h3>4. Enter the New Combination</h3>

<p>Once the reset button has been pressed, you can now enter your new combination. Use the paperclip to turn the dials until you have the combination set.</p>

<h3>5. Test the Combination</h3>

<p>Once you have the combination set, test it by turning the dials and see if it unlocks. If it does, you have successfully reset the lock.</p>

<h3>6. Reattach the Casing</h3>

<p>Once you have verified that the new combination works, reattach the casing with the flathead screwdriver.</p>
