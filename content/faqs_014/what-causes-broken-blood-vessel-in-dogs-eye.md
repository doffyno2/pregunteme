<p>Broken blood vessels in the eyes of dogs can be a worrying sight for any pet owner. Broken blood vessels, or subconjunctival hemorrhages, occur when a blood vessel in the dog’s eye ruptures, resulting in a red patch on the whites of the eye. While the cause of the ruptured vessel can vary, there are a few common culprits. In this article, we'll explore the possible causes of broken blood vessels in dogs’ eyes.</p>

<h2>What is a Subconjunctival Hemorrhage?</h2>

<p>A subconjunctival hemorrhage, or broken blood vessel in the eye, is a common eye disorder in dogs. It occurs when a blood vessel in the conjunctiva, the clear covering of the white portion of the eye, ruptures and causes a red patch on the whites of the eye. It is sometimes referred to as a ‘red eye’. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is often painless and does not cause any long-term damage to the eye. Generally, it resolves itself within a few days without treatment.</p>

<h2>Common Causes of Broken Blood Vessels in Dogs’ Eyes</h2>

<p>There are several potential causes of broken blood vessels in dogs’ eyes. These can include:</p>

<h3>Trauma</h3>

<p>Trauma is the most common cause of broken blood vessels in dogs’ eyes. This can be due to a direct injury to the eye, such as the dog running into something or getting hit in the face, or due to a sudden increase in pressure inside the eye. This can be caused by a foreign object, such as a branch, entering the eye.</p>

<h3>Allergies</h3>

<p>Allergies can also cause broken blood vessels in the eyes of dogs. Allergies cause inflammation in the eye, which can increase pressure and lead to the rupture of a blood vessel. Common allergens that can cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage include dust mites, pollen, and certain chemicals.</p>

<h3>Eye Infections</h3>

<p>Eye infections can also lead to broken blood vessels in the eyes of dogs. This is because certain bacterial and viral infections can cause inflammation, which can increase pressure in the eye and lead to the rupture of a blood vessel.</p>

<h3>High Blood Pressure</h3>

<p>High blood pressure can also cause broken blood vessels in the eyes of dogs. High blood pressure can cause the blood vessels to become more fragile and prone to rupture.</p>

<h2>Treatment for Broken Blood Vessels in Dogs’ Eyes</h2>

<p>In most cases, broken blood vessels in the eyes of dogs resolve on their own without any treatment. However, if the cause of the broken blood vessel is an infection, allergies, or high blood pressure, it is important to seek treatment for these conditions as soon as possible. Treatments may include antibiotics, anti-allergy medications, or medications to lower the dog’s blood pressure.</p>

<h2>Preventing Broken Blood Vessels in Dogs’ Eyes</h2>

<p>In order to prevent broken blood vessels in the eyes of dogs, it is important to take steps to protect the eyes from trauma, infection, and allergies. This includes ensuring the dog is kept away from any potential sources of trauma, such as sharp objects or rough play. It is also important to ensure the dog is not exposed to any potential allergens, and to keep the dog’s eyes clean and free of any infectious agents.</p>
