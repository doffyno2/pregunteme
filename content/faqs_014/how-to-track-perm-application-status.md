<p>Employers who are looking to hire foreign nationals must first obtain a labor certification from the United States Department of Labor (DOL). This labor certification is known as the Program Electronic Review Management (PERM) certification. The PERM certification is required for any employer who wants to hire foreign nationals in the United States. The PERM certification process can be lengthy and complex, and employers may find themselves wondering how to track their application status.</p>

<h2>What Is PERM?</h2>

<p>PERM is a labor certification program that is overseen by the U.S. Department of Labor. This program is used to ensure that employers are not undermining the domestic U.S. workforce by hiring foreign nationals instead. The program requires employers to go through a multi-step process that includes filing a labor certification application, advertising the job opening, and obtaining a prevailing wage determination. It also requires employers to demonstrate that they have conducted a good faith effort to hire a U.S. worker.</p>

<h2>How to Track the PERM Application Status</h2>

<p>The PERM application can take anywhere from six months to a year to complete, and employers may find themselves wondering how to track their application status. Thankfully, the DOL has created a website known as the iCERT Portal System that employers can use to track their applications. To use the system, employers must first register for an iCERT account. Here are the steps for how to track the PERM application status:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Register for an iCERT Account</h3>

<p>The first step for tracking the PERM application status is to register for an iCERT account. To do this, employers must visit the iCERT Portal System website and click on the “Register” button. From there, employers will be asked to provide information such as their name, address, and contact information. Once the information has been submitted, employers will receive an email confirming their registration.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Login to the iCERT Portal System</h3>

<p>Once employers have registered for an iCERT account, they can login to the iCERT Portal System. On the homepage, employers should click on the “Login” button and enter their username and password. Once they have logged in, they will be able to view their PERM application status.</p>

<h3>Step 3: View the PERM Application Status</h3>

<p>The iCERT Portal System will provide employers with detailed information about their PERM application status. Employers can view the status of their application such as whether it has been approved or denied, as well as any other pertinent information. The system will also provide employers with a timeline of when the application was submitted and when it was approved or denied.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Contact DOL If Needed</h3>

<p>If employers have any questions or concerns about their application status, they can contact the DOL directly. The DOL will be able to provide employers with more detailed information about their application status, as well as any other questions they may have.</p>
