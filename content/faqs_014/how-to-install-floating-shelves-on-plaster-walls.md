Floating shelves are a great way to add storage and display space to any room without taking up much space. Installing floating shelves on plaster walls is a simple task, but it does require a few steps. In this article, we will cover the basics of how to install floating shelves on plaster walls, so you can get the job done quickly and easily.

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

Before you get started, you will need to gather a few supplies. You will need a drill, a screwdriver, wall anchors, screws, and of course the floating shelves themselves. You will also need to measure the space where you plan to install the shelves, so you can make sure they fit properly.

<h2>Preparing the Walls</h2>

The first step in installing floating shelves on plaster walls is to prepare the walls. You will need to make sure the walls are clean and free of debris. You should also make sure there are no cracks or holes in the plaster. If there are, you should patch them up before you begin.

<h2>Drilling Holes</h2>

Once the walls are ready, you can begin drilling the holes for the wall anchors. You should drill the holes slightly larger than the wall anchors you are using, to ensure a secure fit. Make sure to use a drill bit that is appropriate for the wall material.

<h2>Installing Wall Anchors</h2>

Once the holes are drilled, you can begin installing the wall anchors. The wall anchors should be inserted into the holes and then tightened with a screwdriver. Make sure the wall anchors are flush with the wall, and double check that they are secure.

<h2>Attaching the Shelves</h2>

Now that the wall anchors are installed, you can begin attaching the shelves. Place the shelves on the wall anchors, and then use the screws provided to secure them in place. Make sure the screws are firmly secured, and double check that the shelves are level.

<h2>Finishing Up</h2>

Once the shelves are attached, you can start adding decorations and other items to the shelves. You should make sure the shelves are level and secure before adding any items. You can also use wall anchors to secure heavier items to the wall if needed.
