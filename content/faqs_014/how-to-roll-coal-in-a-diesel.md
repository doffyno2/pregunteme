Rolling coal is a process in which diesel fuel is injected into the exhaust system of a diesel-powered vehicle, causing it to emit large amounts of black smoke. The act of rolling coal is used to give a diesel truck an increased amount of power and torque, but it can also be used as a form of protest against environmental regulations. In this article, we'll look at how to roll coal in a diesel and the potential risks involved.

<h2>What is Rolling Coal?</h2>

Rolling coal is a process in which diesel fuel is injected into the exhaust system of a diesel-powered vehicle. This process causes the vehicle to emit large amounts of black smoke, which can be seen from a distance and is often used as a form of protest against environmental regulations.

The process of rolling coal also results in an increase in power and torque for the vehicle, as it gives the engine more oxygen and fuel to burn. This is why many diesel truck owners opt to roll coal, as it gives them more power when towing or hauling heavy loads.

<h2>How to Roll Coal in a Diesel</h2>

The process of rolling coal in a diesel is relatively simple and can be done with a few basic tools. To begin, you will need to purchase a "smoke switch" or a "smoke box" from an aftermarket parts supplier. This device will allow you to control the amount of fuel being injected into the exhaust system.

Once you have the smoke switch or box, you will need to install it in the engine bay. This can be done by bolting it to the firewall or by using a custom-made bracket. 

Next, you will need to connect the smoke switch to the fuel injectors. This can be done by running a fuel line from the injectors to the switch. Once the switch is connected, you can then adjust the amount of fuel being injected into the exhaust system.

Finally, you will need to adjust the engine's air/fuel ratio. This can be done by adjusting the air filter or the fuel injectors. Once the air/fuel ratio is set, you can then start rolling coal.

<h2>Potential Risks of Rolling Coal</h2>

Although the process of rolling coal can result in increased power and torque for your vehicle, it can also have some potentially dangerous side effects. For instance, rolling coal can result in increased emissions, which can damage the environment and put people's health at risk.

Additionally, rolling coal can also result in an increase in noise pollution. This can be particularly troublesome if you live in a residential area or near a school or hospital.

Finally, it's important to note that rolling coal can also be illegal in some areas. This is because many states and municipalities have laws that regulate vehicle emissions. As such, it's important to check your local laws before rolling coal.
