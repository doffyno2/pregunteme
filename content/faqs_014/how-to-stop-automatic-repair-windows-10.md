<p>Windows 10 is a great operating system and it offers a lot of features to its users. However, even with its advanced features, there are still times when it can malfunction and cause problems. One of the most common issues is the automatic repair loop, which can be quite annoying and difficult to fix. Fortunately, there are some solutions you can try to stop automatic repair in Windows 10 and get your system back up and running again.</p>

<h2>What is the Automatic Repair Loop?</h2>

<p>The automatic repair loop occurs when Windows 10 is unable to repair a problem with your system on its own. When this happens, the system will enter a loop where it will continually attempt to repair the issue, but it will never be able to do so. This can be a frustrating issue, as it can prevent you from being able to use your computer.</p>

<h2>What Causes the Automatic Repair Loop?</h2>

<p>The automatic repair loop can be caused by a variety of different issues. It is usually caused by either a corrupt Windows installation, a hardware issue, or a virus. It can also be caused by a problem with the system's boot files or by a problem with the system's drivers.</p>

<h2>How to Stop Automatic Repair in Windows 10</h2>

<p>If you are experiencing an automatic repair loop in Windows 10, there are a few solutions you can try to fix the issue. The simplest solution is to use the Windows 10 boot repair tool. This tool can be used to diagnose and repair any issues with the boot files or drivers on your system. To use the tool, press the Windows key + R to open the Run window, then type “bootrec.exe” and press enter.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Windows 10 Boot Repair Tool</h2>

<p>Once you have opened the boot repair tool, you will have a few options to choose from. The first option is to scan the system for errors. This will scan your system and detect any errors that may be causing the automatic repair loop. Once the scan is complete, you will be given the option to repair any errors that were found.</p>

<p>The second option is to repair the boot files. This will repair any corrupted boot files that may be causing the issue. If you are having trouble with a specific driver, you can also use the tool to repair the driver.</p>

<p>Once you have repaired any errors or boot files, you can then restart your computer and see if the issue has been resolved. If the issue is still present, you may need to perform a clean install of Windows 10 to completely fix the issue.</p>

<h2>Other Solutions to Stop Automatic Repair in Windows 10</h2>

<p>If the boot repair tool doesn't fix the automatic repair loop, there are a few other solutions you can try. One solution is to run a full system scan with a reliable antivirus program. This will detect and remove any viruses or malicious software that may be causing the issue.</p>

<p>You can also try running the System File Checker tool. This tool can be used to repair any corrupted system files that may be causing the issue. To run the tool, press the Windows key + R to open the Run window, then type “sfc /scannow” and press enter.</p>
