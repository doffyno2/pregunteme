<p>An Allen wrench (or Allen key) is an essential tool for any handyman or DIY enthusiast. It is a hexagonal-shaped wrench used to drive screws and bolts with an Allen head.

They are simple to use and relatively inexpensive, making them a popular tool for many trades.</p>

<h2>What Does an Allen Wrench Look Like?</h2>

<p>An Allen wrench is a six-sided tool, with each side of the hexagon having its own size measurement. The size of the wrench is determined by its largest measurement, which is printed on the wrench. For example, a standard 3/16 inch Allen wrench has a maximum size of 3/16 inch, while a 7/32 inch Allen wrench has a maximum size of 7/32 inch. The most common sizes are 1/8 inch, 3/16 inch, 1/4 inch, 5/16 inch, 3/8 inch, 7/16 inch, and 1/2 inch.</p>

<p>An Allen wrench has a long handle and a short, hexagonal-shaped tip. The tip is designed to fit into the recessed hexagonal-shaped hole of an Allen head screw or bolt. The handle of the wrench is usually made of steel, with a finish that is either chrome-plated, black oxide, or zinc-plated. The end of the handle may include a ball end, allowing for better access to recessed screws in tight spaces.</p>
