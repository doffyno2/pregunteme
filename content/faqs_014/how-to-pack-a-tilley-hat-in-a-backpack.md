<p>Tilley hats have been a staple of outdoor fashion for more than 80 years. They’re known for their durability and style, and they’re a great way to stay protected from the elements when you’re out and about. But if you’re an outdoor enthusiast, chances are you’re going to be carrying a backpack with you, and you need to know how to pack a Tilley hat in a backpack so it doesn’t get damaged.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Backpack</h2>

<p>The first step in packing a Tilley hat in a backpack is to choose the right backpack. You want something that’s lightweight and durable, with plenty of internal pockets and compartments to store your gear. You also want to make sure the backpack is large enough to fit your Tilley hat without compromising on space for other items. Look for backpacks with a padded or hardshell top compartment, as this will provide extra protection for your Tilley hat.</p>

<h2>Packing the Tilley Hat</h2>

<p>Once you’ve chosen the right backpack, it’s time to pack your Tilley hat. Start by folding the brim of the hat in half and placing it in the center of the backpack. Then, place a soft cloth, such as a bandana or a piece of cotton fabric, around the hat to protect it from scratches. Finally, place the hat in the top compartment of the backpack and use the internal pockets and compartments to store other items, such as snacks, a water bottle, and other gear.</p>

<h2>Using the External Pockets</h2>

<p>If you’re concerned about the hat taking up too much space in the backpack, you can use the external pockets to store other items. Many backpacks have external pockets that are designed specifically for hats, so you can easily slip your Tilley hat in one of these pockets and it will be secure and out of the way. This is especially useful if you’re carrying a large backpack with you and need to conserve space.</p>
