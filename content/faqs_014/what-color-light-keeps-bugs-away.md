<p>Insects can be a nuisance, especially during the warmer months. It can be hard to keep them away from your home, and even harder to keep them from entering your living space. Luckily, there is a way to keep them away using light. Different colors of light can be used to repel insects, with certain colors being more effective than others. Read on to find out what color light keeps bugs away.</p>

<h2>How Does Color Light Affect Insects?</h2>

<p>Insects are attracted to light in general, but they are more drawn to certain colors than others. For example, many bugs are attracted to yellow and ultraviolet light. If you have lights of these colors outside your home, you may be unknowingly attracting more bugs than necessary. On the other hand, certain colors of light can actually repel bugs, like blue and green light. This is due to the fact that these colors are not as attractive to insects and therefore they are less likely to be drawn to them.</p>

<h2>What Color Light Keeps Bugs Away?</h2>

<p>The best color light to keep bugs away is blue and green. These colors are not attractive to most insects, so they will be less likely to be drawn towards them. Additionally, these colors are not as bright as other colors, so they won’t be as noticeable to humans. This makes them ideal for keeping bugs away without drawing too much attention to your home.</p>

<h2>What Other Colors Repel Bugs?</h2>

<p>In addition to blue and green light, other colors like white and yellow can also be used to repel insects. White light is particularly effective, as it is bright enough to be noticed by bugs but not attractive enough to draw them in. Yellow light is also effective, as it is not as attractive as other colors, but still bright enough to be noticed. Additionally, red light has been shown to be effective in repelling certain insects, though it is not as effective as the other colors mentioned.</p>

<h2>How to Use Color Light to Repel Bugs</h2>

<p>Now that you know what color light keeps bugs away, you may be wondering how to use it to your advantage. The best way to use color light to repel bugs is to install lights outside your home that emit blue or green light.
