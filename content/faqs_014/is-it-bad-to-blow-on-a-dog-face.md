There is a common misconception that blowing on a dog's face is bad for them and should be avoided - but is this really true? In this article, we'll explore the answer to this question and provide advice on how to interact with your canine companion in the safest and most enjoyable way possible.

<h2>Do Dogs Like Being Blown On?</h2>

Most dogs do not like being blown on, and it can often cause them to become agitated and uncomfortable. This is because the sensation of air hitting their face can startle them and cause them to feel anxious. Some breeds of dogs, such as Bulldogs and Poodles, are more sensitive to this sensation than others and may become even more upset when they are blown on.

<h2>Why Is Blowing on a Dog's Face Unsafe?</h2>

Blowing on a dog's face can be dangerous for several reasons. First, it can cause the dog to become agitated and potentially aggressive.

Additionally, blowing on a dog's face can also cause them to become stressed and anxious, particularly if it is done too forcefully or too often.
