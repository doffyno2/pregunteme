A jockey shifter allows you to select gears manually, without the need for a clutch. It is an ideal setup for those who want to experience the thrill of manual gear selection without the hassle of a clutch. It is also the perfect setup for racing and performance vehicles. In this article, we'll take a look at how to make a jockey shifter.

<h2>What is a Jockey Shifter?</h2>

A jockey shifter is a type of manual gear shifter that is used in vehicles that do not have a clutch. The jockey shifter is connected directly to the transmission, allowing the driver to shift gears without the use of a clutch. Typically, the jockey shifter is connected to a lever or handle that is mounted on the dashboard or on the side of the gearbox.

<h2>Why Use a Jockey Shifter?</h2>

The main advantage of using a jockey shifter is that it eliminates the need for a clutch. This means that the driver can shift gears quickly and easily, without having to worry about depressing the clutch. This makes the vehicle easier to drive, and is particularly beneficial for performance applications, where quick gear changes are vital.

Jockey shifters are also ideal for racing applications, as they make it easier to shift gears without having to take your foot off the accelerator. This can give the driver an edge in a race, as they can keep the car at maximum power throughout the gear changes.

<h2>How to Make a Jockey Shifter</h2>

Making a jockey shifter is relatively straightforward, and can be done with basic tools and materials. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make your own jockey shifter.

<h3>Step 1: Gather the Materials</h3>

The first step is to gather the materials that you'll need to make the jockey shifter. You'll need a gearbox, a lever or handle, a selection of screws, nuts, bolts and washers, and some electrical connectors.

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Gearbox</h3>

The next step is to prepare the gearbox. This involves removing the existing shifter mechanism and mounting the jockey shifter in its place. It is important to ensure that the jockey shifter is securely mounted, as a loose shifter could result in an unreliable gear selection.

<h3>Step 3: Wire Up the Connectors</h3>

Once the jockey shifter is securely mounted, you'll need to wire up the electrical connectors. This involves connecting the connectors to the gearbox, and then running the wires to the lever or handle.

<h3>Step 4: Test the Jockey Shifter</h3>

Once the jockey shifter is wired up and connected to the gearbox, you'll need to test it. To do this, you'll need to start the engine and then select each gear. If the jockey shifter is working correctly, the gear selection should be smooth and reliable.
