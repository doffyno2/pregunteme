<p>Are you looking for a way to take down those pesky Zealots without breaking a sweat? You've come to the right place. In this guide, we'll be discussing how to one-shot Zealots with Aspect of the End. We'll cover all the basics, from what the Aspect of the End is and how to use it, to advanced strategies for taking out groups of Zealots.</p>

<h2>What is the Aspect of the End?</h2>

<p>The Aspect of the End is a powerful artifact found in the game Path of Exile. It is a powerful weapon that can be used to take out powerful enemies with one hit. The Aspect of the End has an innate ability that increases the size of its effect, meaning it can deal more damage to larger creatures and groups. This makes it ideal for taking out groups of Zealots in one hit.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Aspect of the End</h2>

<p>Using the Aspect of the End is simple. All you need to do is equip it and then aim it at a group of Zealots. When you fire the Aspect of the End, it will automatically increase its size, allowing it to take out multiple Zealots in one hit. The size of the effect is determined by the number of enemies in the group, so make sure to target groups of at least three or four Zealots for maximum efficiency.</p>

<h2>Advanced Strategies for Taking Out Groups of Zealots</h2>

<p>Once you've mastered the basics of using the Aspect of the End, it's time to move on to some advanced strategies. One of the most effective ways to take out groups of Zealots is to use an angle shot. This is where you aim the Aspect of the End at a corner of the group, so that the effect will hit multiple enemies at once. This is a great way to take out large groups of Zealots quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Another useful strategy is to use the Aspect of the End in combination with other skills or abilities. For example, if you have a character that can cast spells, you can use the Aspect of the End to weaken the enemies and then finish them off with a spell. This is a great way to take out groups of Zealots quickly and easily.</p>
