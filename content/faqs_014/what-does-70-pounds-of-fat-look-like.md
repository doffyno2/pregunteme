<p>It's no secret that obesity is a major health issue in the United States and other parts of the world. In fact, more than 70 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. But what does 70 pounds of fat actually look like? This is an important question to ask, because many people have no idea how much weight they should be aiming to lose.</p>

<p>When you think of 70 pounds of fat, it might conjure up images of someone who is morbidly obese. But in reality, that's not the case. A person who is considered to be overweight has a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. So if you are a 5-foot-10-inch man, you would be considered overweight if you weighed 175 pounds and obese if you weighed 210 pounds.</p>

<p>So what does 70 pounds of fat actually look like? To put it in perspective, it's around the same weight as a medium-sized dog. It's also approximately the same weight as seven 10-pound bags of potatoes, or 18 large jugs of milk. To put it another way, it's the equivalent of a large suitcase filled with clothes, or a small refrigerator.</p>

<p>But how does this relate to your own body? If you weigh 170 pounds, for example, losing 70 pounds would take you down to 100 pounds. That's a significant amount of weight loss. The average person needs to consume 2,000 calories a day to maintain their current weight. To lose 70 pounds, a person would need to reduce their calorie intake to 1,400 calories a day. That is a big difference, and it's not an easy feat.</p>

<p>It's also important to consider what 70 pounds of fat looks like on a person's body. To put it plainly, it looks like a lot of fat! A person who is 70 pounds overweight will have excess fat stored in their abdomen, arms, back, hips, and thighs. They will have a “muffin top”, large love handles, and may even have a double chin. It is not a pleasant sight, and it can be difficult to imagine what this much fat looks like on a person.</p>

<p>But it's important to keep in mind that 70 pounds of fat does not necessarily mean someone is morbidly obese. It is possible for someone to be overweight and not have 70 pounds of fat. It all depends on their BMI. Someone who is 5-foot-10-inches tall and weighs 175 pounds, for example, would not be considered obese. But someone who is 6-foot-2-inches tall and weighs 210 pounds would be considered obese.</p>

<p>It's also important to note that carrying 70 pounds of fat does not necessarily mean a person is unhealthy. It is possible for someone to be overweight and still be healthy. Exercise and a healthy diet can help a person lose weight and maintain their health. However, if someone is carrying 70 pounds of fat, it is important to talk to their doctor to ensure they are not at risk of any health issues.</p>
