<p>Wireless dog fences are an increasingly popular way to keep your pet safe and secure within certain boundaries. While they offer a great deal of convenience, they work using radio frequencies, and it can be a bit confusing to understand how they work. In this article, we'll explain the basics of wireless dog fences and the frequencies they use.</p>

<h2>What is a Wireless Dog Fence?</h2>

<p>A wireless dog fence is a simple, convenient way to keep your pet safe and secure. The system works by emitting a radio frequency signal from a transmitter. The signal is picked up by a receiver that's worn on your pet's collar. If your pet crosses the boundary of the signal, the receiver will emit a warning sound or vibration to let your pet know they are close to the boundary. If your pet continues to cross the boundary, the receiver will deliver a mild shock to deter them from going any further.</p>

<h2>How Do Wireless Dog Fences Work?</h2>

<p>Wireless dog fences work by using radio frequency (RF) signals. The transmitter emits an RF signal that is picked up by the receiver on your pet's collar. If your pet crosses the boundary of the signal, the receiver will emit a warning sound or vibration to let your pet know they are close to the boundary. If your pet continues to cross the boundary, the receiver will deliver a mild shock to deter them from going any further.</p>

<h2>What Frequency Do Wireless Dog Fences Use?</h2>

<p>Most wireless dog fences use a frequency of between 25 kHz and 900 kHz. This frequency is within the VHF and UHF ranges, which are also used for commercial radio stations and television broadcasts. The exact frequency used by a particular wireless dog fence system will depend on the model and manufacturer. However, most systems use a frequency between 25 kHz and 900 kHz.</p>

<h2>Why Do Wireless Dog Fences Use Such A Low Frequency?</h2>

<p>The low frequency used by wireless dog fences is necessary to ensure that the signal is strong enough to reach its intended target. The lower the frequency, the better the signal will be able to penetrate through walls and other barriers. Additionally, low frequencies can travel further than higher frequencies, allowing the signal to reach greater distances.</p>

<h2>Are Wireless Dog Fences Safe?</h2>

<p>Yes, wireless dog fences are safe. The shock delivered by the receiver is mild and not harmful to your pet. In fact, it is similar to static electricity or a tingle you feel when touching a metal doorknob after shuffling across the carpet. Additionally, most systems have adjustable shock levels so you can choose the level that best suits your pet.</p>

<h2>What Are The Benefits Of Wireless Dog Fences?</h2>

<p>Wireless dog fences offer a number of benefits, including: 
<ul>
<li>No installation or digging required</li>
<li>Easy to set up and use</li>
<li>Can be used indoors or outdoors</li>
<li>Portable and can be taken with you on trips</li>
<li>Affordable compared to traditional fences</li>
<li>Effective in keeping your pet safe and secure</li>
</ul>
