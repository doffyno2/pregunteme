That’s why we’ve created this “Is My Dog Depressed Quiz” to help you get a better understanding of your pup’s mental wellness.

<h2>What Are the Signs of a Depressed Dog?</h2>

If you’re concerned about your pup’s mental wellbeing, it’s important to know the signs of a depressed dog. Here are the most common signs to look out for:

<ul>
<li><b>Loss of Appetite:</b> If your pup is feeling down, they may lose their appetite. This could be a sign of depression, especially if your pup usually loves their meals.</li>
<li><b>Lack of Interest in Activities:</b> If your pup used to love going for walks, playing fetch, or going to the park, but now shows a lack of interest in these activities, this could be a sign of depression.</li>
<li><b>Excessive Sleeping:</b> If your pup is sleeping more than usual, this could be a sign that they’re feeling down. Of course, excessive sleeping could also be a sign of other health issues, so it’s important to keep an eye on your pup’s sleeping habits.</li>
<li><b>Negative Changes in Behavior:</b> A depressed dog may display negative changes in behavior, such as snapping or being aggressive. It’s important to take any changes in behavior seriously and consult with your vet if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Causes Depression in Dogs?</h2>
