<p>Ranch dressing is one of the most popular salad dressings around, but it can quickly go bad if it’s not stored properly. Here are some tips for telling if your ranch dressing has gone bad and what you can do to prevent it from spoiling.</p>

<h2>Check the Expiration Date</h2>

<p>The best way to tell if your ranch dressing is bad is to check the expiration date on the package. Most ranch dressings have a “best by” date on the label. If the ranch dressing is past its expiration date, it’s best to throw it away and buy a new one.</p>

<h2>Check the Color</h2>

<p>When ranch dressing is fresh, it should be a creamy white color. If it’s off-white or an orange or yellow color, it’s probably gone bad. Additionally, if the ranch dressing has any lumps or chunks in it, it’s a sign that it’s gone bad and should be thrown out.</p>

<h2>Check the Smell</h2>

<p>If the ranch dressing has a sour or unpleasant smell, it’s probably gone bad. Additionally, if it smells like it’s fermented, it’s definitely gone bad and should be thrown out.</p>

<h2>Check the Texture</h2>

<p>If the ranch dressing is too thick or has separated, it’s probably gone bad. Additionally, if it’s watery or has an oily texture, it’s a sign that it’s gone bad and should be thrown out.</p>

<h2>Storing Ranch Dressing</h2>

<p>To prevent ranch dressing from going bad, it’s important to store it properly. Unopened ranch dressing should be kept in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. If possible, it should be kept in the refrigerator. Opened ranch dressing should be tightly sealed and stored in the refrigerator. It should be used within one week of opening.</p>
