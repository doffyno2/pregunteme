Universal Studios is one of the world's most famous and celebrated theme parks, located in Orlando, Florida. People from all over the world come to visit the park and to experience the thrill of its rides and attractions. But with the recent outbreak of COVID-19, the park has had to adjust its operations and capacity to adhere to safety guidelines and ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for visitors. This article will provide an overview of what capacity Universal Studios is currently operating at and how it is adapting to the current situation.

<h2>Universal Studios Capacity Regulations</h2>

In order to adhere to safety guidelines and protect visitors, Universal Studios has implemented several regulations regarding capacity. One of the most important regulations is that the number of people allowed in the park must be limited. The exact number is determined by the government’s health regulations and the park’s own safety protocols.

At this time, Universal Studios is operating at a reduced capacity of 25%. This means that the park can only accommodate up to 25% of its maximum capacity at any given time. This includes both indoor and outdoor attractions. For example, if the maximum capacity for an attraction is 1000 people, then only 250 people are allowed in the park at any given time.

The park also has a strict no-entry policy for anyone who is not wearing a face covering. All guests must wear a face covering at all times while in the park. This is to ensure the safety of all visitors and employees.

<h2>Universal Studios Health and Safety Protocols</h2>

In addition to its capacity regulations, Universal Studios has implemented several other protocols to ensure the health and safety of its visitors and employees. These include:

<h3>Social Distancing</h3>

Universal Studios has implemented social distancing measures throughout the park. All attractions, restaurants, and shops must adhere to social distancing guidelines. Guests must remain at least 6 feet apart from each other at all times.

<h3>Sanitization</h3>

Universal Studios has a rigorous sanitization protocol in place. The park has implemented enhanced sanitization measures for all attractions, restaurants, and shops. High-touch surfaces are sanitized multiple times a day.

<h3>Temperature Checks</h3>

Universal Studios requires all guests and employees to have their temperatures checked before entering the park. Anyone with a fever or other symptoms of COVID-19 will not be allowed to enter the park.

<h2>Universal Studios Reopening Plan</h2>

Universal Studios has announced a phased reopening plan for the park. The plan is designed to gradually increase capacity and allow more guests to enjoy the park.

The first phase of the plan allows the park to operate at 25% of its maximum capacity. This will allow the park to slowly increase the number of guests and ensure that all safety protocols are in place.

The second phase will allow the park to operate at 50% of its maximum capacity. This will allow the park to accommodate more guests while still adhering to safety protocols.

The final phase of the plan will allow the park to operate at 100% capacity. This will allow the park to accommodate its full capacity of guests and ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.
