<p>Having a reliable bike chain is essential for any cyclist, whether you are a commuter, a mountain biker, or a leisurely rider. Unfortunately, even the sturdiest of chains can experience problems at some point, and one of the most common issues is slipping under load. This can be a frustrating experience, but knowing what to look for and how to troubleshoot is key to getting you back on the road or trail.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Bike Chain to Slip Under Load?</h2>

<p>When a bike chain slips under load, it can be caused by a few different factors. One of the main culprits is a worn out chain. As chains are used, they can become worn down over time and this can cause them to slip. This is especially true for mountain bikers that ride in harsh conditions, as dirt and grit can increase the wear and tear on the chain.</p>

<p>Chain tension is also important when it comes to keeping the chain from slipping. If the chain is too tight, it can cause the gears to slip when you are pedaling. On the other hand, if the chain is too loose, it can cause the chain to slip off the teeth of the sprockets when you apply pressure.</p>

<h2>How Do You Stop a Bike Chain From Slipping Under Load?</h2>

<p>The best way to stop a bike chain from slipping under load is to regularly inspect and maintain your bike chain. This includes checking the chain tension, ensuring that the chain is properly lubricated, and replacing the chain when necessary. Additionally, it is important to keep your bike clean and free of debris, as dirt and grit can cause the chain to slip.</p>

<p>If you are having issues with your bike chain slipping under load, the first thing you should do is check the chain tension. This can be done by manually pulling the chain away from the sprockets and measuring the amount of slack. If the chain has more than a quarter of an inch of slack, it is likely too loose and needs to be tightened up.</p>

<p>If the tension is correct, then you may need to check the lubrication of the chain. A properly lubricated chain should be free of dirt and grime, and should have a light coating of oil. If the chain is dirty or dry, it should be cleaned and lubricated with a bike-specific lubricant.</p>

<p>Finally, if your chain is still slipping, it may be time to replace it. Chains should be replaced every 1,000 - 2,000 miles, depending on usage and conditions. When replacing a chain, it is important to use a bike-specific chain that is compatible with your bike's drivetrain.</p>
