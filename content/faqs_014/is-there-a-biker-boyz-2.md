<p>Biker Boyz is a 2003 American film directed by Reggie Rock Bythewood. The movie features an African-American cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Derek Luke, Meagan Good and Orlando Jones. Biker Boyz follows the story of Smoke, a legendary street racer played by Luke, and his quest to become the king of the underground bike racing world.</p>

<p>The movie was a box office success and its soundtrack was a massive hit. The movie grossed over $20 million worldwide, and spawned a cult following among fans of the genre. But despite its success, there has never been a sequel. So, is there a Biker Boyz 2 in the works?</p>

<h2>What Happened To Biker Boyz 2?</h2>

<p>The original Biker Boyz was released in early 2003, and was an immediate success. However, despite its success, a sequel was never made. There have been several rumors over the years, but nothing has ever materialized. So what happened?</p>

<p>The most likely explanation is that the filmmaker, Reggie Rock Bythewood, simply never had the time or money to make a sequel. Bythewood has been busy directing other projects, including the critically acclaimed drama Brown Sugar and the underrated comedy Get on Up. It's possible that he simply didn't have the resources to make another Biker Boyz movie.</p>

<p>It's also possible that the studio simply didn't think a sequel would be profitable. The original movie only grossed $20 million, and sequels often have a hard time recouping their production budgets. The studio might have decided that it was better to just leave the franchise alone rather than risk losing money on a sequel.</p>

<h2>Will We Ever See A Biker Boyz 2?</h2>

<p>It's hard to say. The original movie was released over 15 years ago, and the director, Reggie Rock Bythewood, is currently busy with other projects. It's possible that he might revisit the franchise in the future, but it's also possible that he never will.</p>

<p>It's also possible that another filmmaker could take up the mantle and make a Biker Boyz sequel. After all, there have been plenty of successful sequels to cult films such as The Matrix and Mad Max. However, it's unlikely that such a project would ever get off the ground without the involvement of the original filmmakers.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It's unlikely that we'll ever see a Biker Boyz 2. The original movie was a success, but it didn't make enough money to justify a sequel. The director, Reggie Rock Bythewood, is currently busy working on other projects, and it's unlikely that he'll ever have the time to make another Biker Boyz movie.</p>
