<p>Cracked plastic shower bases can be a real eyesore and they can cause a lot of problems in a bathroom. If the crack is minor, it can still be a safety hazard, as the base can become slippery and cause a person to slip and fall. If the crack is major, it can start to leak and cause water damage to the surrounding area. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to repair a cracked plastic shower base.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>
<p>Before you begin your repair, you will need some supplies. You will need a piece of plastic that is large enough to cover the cracked area. You will also need some plastic adhesive, preferably one that is waterproof. You may also need a heat gun, depending on the type of plastic you are using. Finally, you will need some sandpaper, a putty knife, and a utility knife.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Area</h2>
<p>The first step in repairing a cracked plastic shower base is to clean the area. Use a mild detergent and a soft cloth to remove any dirt, grime, and debris from the area. Make sure the area is completely dry before continuing.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Cut the Plastic Patch</h2>
<p>Next, you will need to cut the plastic patch that will cover the cracked area. Make sure the patch is slightly larger than the crack so it will cover it completely. You can use a utility knife to cut the patch. Make sure the edges are smooth and free of any burrs.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Apply the Adhesive</h2>
<p>Once the patch is cut, you can apply the adhesive. Make sure to follow the instructions on the adhesive’s packaging. Generally, you will need to apply the adhesive to both the patch and the cracked area. Use a putty knife to spread the adhesive evenly.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Place the Patch</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to place the patch over the cracked area. Make sure it is placed firmly and evenly. Use a putty knife to press the patch down and make sure there are no air bubbles.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Smooth Out the Edges</h2>
<p>Once the patch is in place, you can use sandpaper to smooth out the edges and make sure it is flush with the rest of the shower base. This will help to ensure that the patch is waterproof and will last for a long time.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Heat the Patch</h2>
<p>Finally, if you are using a heat-activated adhesive, you will need to use a heat gun to activate the adhesive. Make sure to follow the instructions on the adhesive’s packaging and do not use a heat gun that is too hot. This will help to ensure that the patch is firmly in place and will last for a long time.</p>
