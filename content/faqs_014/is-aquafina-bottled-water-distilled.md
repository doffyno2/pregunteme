<p>Aquafina is one of the most popular brands of bottled water available in the United States and many other countries around the world. Many people are curious to know if Aquafina water is distilled or not. The answer is yes, Aquafina water is distilled.</p>

<p>Aquafina water is sourced from public water systems and then goes through a rigorous purification process before it is bottled. This process includes reverse osmosis, ultraviolet light, and ozonation. After purification, the water is further purified through a seven-step distillation process.</p>

<p>The first step of the distillation process is filtration. During this step, the water is filtered through a carbon filter to remove chlorine, lead, and other impurities. The second step is a sedimentation process which removes large particles from the water. The third step is deionization, which removes any remaining ions from the water.</p>

<p>The fourth step is reverse osmosis. During this step, the water is forced through a semi-permeable membrane to remove dissolved minerals and other contaminants. The fifth step is demineralization, which removes any remaining minerals from the water. The sixth step is ultraviolet light disinfection, which destroys any remaining bacteria or viruses in the water. The seventh and final step is ozonation, which adds oxygen to the water.</p>

<p>After the seven steps of purification and distillation, the water is bottled and labeled as “Aquafina.” Aquafina is a purified drinking water that has been filtered and purified to meet or exceed all government standards for drinking water.</p>

<h2>How Does Aquafina Compare to Tap Water?</h2>

<p>Aquafina bottled water is significantly different from tap water. Tap water is typically treated with chlorine or other disinfectants to kill bacteria and other contaminants. The quality of tap water can vary widely from one area to another, and it is not always safe to drink. On the other hand, Aquafina is purified water that has been through a rigorous seven-step process to ensure its purity and safety.</p>

<p>Aquafina also tastes better than tap water. Tap water can have a strong taste and odor, while Aquafina has a clean, refreshing taste. Aquafina can also be more convenient than tap water if you are on the go and want to stay hydrated. It is also a great option for those who live in areas with poor tap water quality.</p>

<h2>Does Aquafina Contain Fluoride?</h2>

<p>No, Aquafina does not contain fluoride. Fluoride is typically added to municipal water systems to help prevent tooth decay, but it is not added to Aquafina during the purification and distillation process.</p>

<h2>Is Aquafina Safe to Drink?</h2>

<p>Yes, Aquafina is safe to drink. Aquafina is purified through a seven-step process to ensure its purity and safety. Aquafina is also tested regularly to ensure it meets or exceeds all government standards for drinking water.</p>
