<p>The sight of a water damaged monitor can be a heart-stopping experience for any computer user. When water gets into the monitor, it can cause all kinds of issues, from short-circuiting the circuitry to damaging the components. In some cases, the damage is so extensive that it is impossible to repair the monitor. But in many cases, the damage can be repaired with a few simple steps.</p>
