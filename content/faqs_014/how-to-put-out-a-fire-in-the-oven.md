<p>Cooking is an art, and a fire in an oven can be an intimidating and dangerous situation. Though it might seem impossible, it is possible to put out a fire in an oven. Here are the steps you need to take to put out a fire in the oven:</p>

<h2>Remove the Source of the Fire</h2>

<p>If possible, it is important to remove the source of the fire. This can be done by carefully removing whatever is burning from the oven.
