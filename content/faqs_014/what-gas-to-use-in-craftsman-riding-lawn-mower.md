<p>Having a Craftsman riding lawn mower is a great way to keep your lawn looking its best. But it is important to make sure you are using the right type of gas in order to ensure your mower runs efficiently and lasts for years to come. In this article, we will discuss what gas to use in your Craftsman riding lawn mower and the importance of using the right type of fuel for your mower.</p>

<h2>What Kind of Gas Should I Use in My Craftsman Riding Lawn Mower?</h2>

<p>The best type of gas to use in your Craftsman riding lawn mower is regular unleaded gasoline with an octane rating of 87 or higher. You should never use gas with an octane rating lower than 87, as this can cause pre-ignition and other engine problems. It is also important to make sure the gas you use is fresh, as stale gas can cause engine problems as well.</p>

<h2>Why Is the Type of Gas I Use Important?</h2>

<p>Using the right type of gas in your Craftsman riding lawn mower is important for several reasons. First, the wrong type of gas can cause pre-ignition, which can damage your engine. Pre-ignition occurs when the fuel and air mixture in the engine is ignited before the spark plug fires, leading to a rapid increase in pressure and temperature in the cylinder. This can cause severe damage to the engine and can even lead to engine failure. Second, using the wrong type of gas can also cause your engine to run inefficiently and reduce its lifespan. Lastly, using the wrong type of gas can cause your mower to emit more pollutants into the air, which can be harmful to the environment.</p>

<h2>What Else Should I Know About Fuel for My Craftsman Riding Lawn Mower?</h2>

<p>In addition to using the right type of gasoline, you should also make sure to regularly check the oil level in your Craftsman riding lawn mower. Low oil levels can cause engine damage and reduce the life of your mower. You should also make sure to use a fuel stabilizer when storing your mower to prevent the fuel from breaking down and becoming unusable. Finally, you should always use fresh gas when refilling your mower, as stale gas can cause engine problems.</p>
