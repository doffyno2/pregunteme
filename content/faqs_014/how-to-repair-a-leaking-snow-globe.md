<p>A snow globe is a beautiful and precious object that can become a beloved family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation. Unfortunately, these delicate items can become damaged, and one of the most common issues is a leak. Whether it’s water or glycerin, a leaking snow globe can quickly become a mess. Fortunately, with a few simple steps, you can repair your snow globe and get it looking like new.</p>

<h2>Gathering the Supplies</h2>

<p>Before you can begin repairing your snow globe, you’ll need to gather the supplies. The most important supplies you’ll need are a sealant, a needle-nose pliers, and a screwdriver. You’ll also need a pair of latex gloves, a pair of safety glasses, and a container to hold any loose parts. Once you have all of these supplies, you’re ready to start the repair.</p>

<h2>Removing the Base</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing your snow globe is to remove the base. To do this, you’ll need to use the screwdriver to unscrew the screws that are holding the base in place. Once the screws are removed, you can carefully lift the base off of the globe. Be sure to place the base and the screws in a safe place where they won’t get lost.</p>

<h2>Inspecting the Globe</h2>

<p>Once the base is off, you can begin to inspect the globe. Look for any cracks or holes that may be causing the leak. If you find a crack or a hole, you’ll need to use the needle-nose pliers to widen the crack or hole. This will allow the sealant to flow into the crack or hole and create a seal.</p>

<h2>Applying the Sealant</h2>

<p>Once you’ve widened any cracks or holes, you can begin to apply the sealant. Be sure to use the latex gloves to protect your hands from the sealant. Apply a thin layer of sealant around the crack or hole, and then use the needle-nose pliers to spread the sealant and ensure that it fills the crack or hole completely. Once the sealant has been applied, you can let it dry for 24 hours before continuing.</p>

<h2>Reassembling the Globe</h2>

<p>Once the sealant has had time to dry, you can begin to reassemble the snow globe. Start by replacing the base and screwing it in place. Make sure that the screws are tight so that the base won’t come loose. Then, you can fill the globe with water or glycerin, depending on what type of snow globe you have. Once the globe is filled, you can replace the top and your snow globe is ready to be displayed.</p>
