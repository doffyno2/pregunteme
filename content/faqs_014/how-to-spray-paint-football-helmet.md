<p>Football helmets are an essential part of the football uniform and they need to look their best. Spray painting a football helmet is an easy and cost-effective way to update a helmet. With the right preparation and materials, anyone can give their helmet a new look in no time.</p>

<h2>Gather the Supplies</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you will need to gather the supplies you need. You will need a football helmet, a respirator, painter’s tape, a wire brush, a dust mask, a drop cloth or newspaper, and spray paint in your desired color. It is also helpful to have a can of clear coat to give your helmet a glossy finish.</p>

<h2>Prepare the Helmet</h2>

<p>Once you have your supplies, you will need to prepare the helmet for painting. Start by removing all of the decals and stickers from the helmet. You can use a wire brush to help remove any stubborn stickers. Make sure you wear a dust mask to avoid breathing in any particles. Clean the helmet with a damp cloth and let it dry completely.</p>

<h2>Mask Off Areas</h2>

<p>It is important to mask off areas that you don’t want to paint. Use painter’s tape to cover any areas you don’t want to get paint on. This includes the face mask and any vents or openings on the helmet. Make sure the tape is firmly pressed down so no paint will seep through.</p>

<h2>Spray the Helmet</h2>

<p>Once the helmet is prepped, it’s time to start painting. Put on a respirator mask to protect yourself from the fumes of the spray paint. Place the helmet on a drop cloth or newspaper to catch any overspray. Using even, light strokes, spray the helmet from left to right. Make sure to keep the can moving to avoid dripping or pooling of the paint. Let the paint dry for at least two hours before adding a second coat.</p>

<h2>Add a Clear Coat</h2>

<p>Once you are happy with the color of the helmet, you can add a clear coat for a glossy finish. This is optional, but it will give the helmet a professional look. Apply the clear coat with the same even strokes as the paint and let it dry for at least two hours.</p>

<h2>Remove the Masking Tape</h2>

<p>Once the clear coat has dried completely, you can remove the masking tape. Carefully peel off the tape and discard it. Your helmet is now ready to wear!</p>
