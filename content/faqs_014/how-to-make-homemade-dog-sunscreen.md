<h2>What is Dog Sunscreen and Why is it Necessary?</h2>

Just like human skin, canine skin is susceptible to the sun’s damaging UV rays. Dogs can suffer from sunburn, skin cancer and other skin related problems when they’re exposed to the sun. Dog sunscreen is specifically formulated to protect your pup’s skin from the sun’s harmful rays. It’s typically made with ingredients that are safe for your pup and designed to block out the sun’s UVA and UVB rays.

<h2>What Ingredients to Look for in Dog Sunscreen?</h2>

When choosing a sunscreen for your pup, it’s important to pick one that is specifically designed for canine skin. Look for a sunscreen that contains zinc oxide, titanium dioxide or avobenzone as these are the ingredients that will help protect your pup’s skin from the sun’s harmful rays. Additionally, look for a sunscreen that is free of parabens and fragrances, as these can be irritating to your pup’s skin.

<h2>How to Make Homemade Dog Sunscreen?</h2>

Making homemade dog sunscreen is a great way to protect your pup’s skin without exposing them to potentially irritating ingredients. You’ll need a few supplies and just a few minutes of your time. Here’s what you’ll need:

• Unrefined coconut oil
• Zinc oxide
• Essential oil (optional)

<h3>Step 1: Gather Your Supplies</h3>

Gather the supplies you’ll need to make your homemade dog sunscreen: unrefined coconut oil, zinc oxide, and an essential oil (optional).

<h3>Step 2: Melt the Coconut Oil</h3>

In a double boiler, melt the coconut oil until it is in liquid form. Make sure it is not too hot before moving on to the next step.

<h3>Step 3: Add the Zinc Oxide</h3>

Once the coconut oil is melted, add in the zinc oxide. Stir until well combined.

<h3>Step 4: Add Essential Oil (optional)</h3>

If desired, you can add a few drops of essential oil to the mixture. This is completely optional, but it can help add a nice scent to the sunscreen.

<h3>Step 5: Pour the Mixture into a Container</h3>

Once the sunscreen is well combined, pour it into a container that can be sealed tightly. We recommend using a small mason jar or a travel-sized container.

<h3>Step 6: Apply the Sunscreen to Your Pup!</h3>

Your homemade dog sunscreen is now ready to use! Before heading outside, apply a generous amount of sunscreen to all exposed areas of your pup’s body (including the ears, nose, and belly). Make sure to reapply every couple of hours, or more often if your pup is in the sun for an extended period of time.
