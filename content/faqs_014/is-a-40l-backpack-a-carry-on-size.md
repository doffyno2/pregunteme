<p>When it comes to packing for a trip, the size of the luggage you bring can make all the difference. Knowing what size of luggage is allowed on a flight as a carry-on can save you time, money, and the hassle of having to check your bag. The question of whether a 40L backpack is a carry on size is one that comes up frequently. While the answer will depend on the airline, in general, a 40L backpack should fit within the carry-on size limits.</p>

<h2>What is a 40L Backpack?</h2>

<p>A 40L backpack is a popular size for travel. It offers enough room for a few days' worth of clothes and supplies, but it's still small enough to be considered carry-on luggage. The capacity of a 40L backpack is typically measured in liters, with one liter equaling 1,000 cubic centimeters. A 40L backpack is 40,000 cubic centimeters or 40 liters. This size of backpack is generally considered to be a medium size and is good for weekend trips or longer trips where you need to pack light.</p>

<h2>Carry On Size Limits</h2>

<p>Most airlines have similar restrictions when it comes to carry-on luggage size. Typically, a carry-on bag must be less than 45 linear inches, which is the combined length, width, and height of the bag. For a 40L backpack, this typically means the bag must be less than 22 inches tall, 14 inches wide, and 9 inches deep. While this is the general guideline, it is important to check with your airline for their specific carry-on size limits. Some airlines may have stricter requirements for carry-on bags.</p>

<h2>Will a 40L Backpack Fit in the Overhead Bin?</h2>

<p>In general, a 40L backpack should fit in most overhead bins. However, this will depend on the airline and the size of the overhead bin. Some overhead bins may be too small to fit a 40L backpack, so it's important to check with your airline before your flight. You may also want to measure your backpack to ensure it meets the size requirements for carry-on luggage.</p>

<h2>What Else Should You Consider When Packing a 40L Backpack?</h2>

<p>When packing a 40L backpack, it's important to remember that you may need to provide access to the contents of your bag when going through airport security. In order to avoid delays, it is best to pack items in a way that allows you to easily remove items from the bag when needed.
