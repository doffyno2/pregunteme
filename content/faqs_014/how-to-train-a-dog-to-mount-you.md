Dogs can be taught to perform a variety of behaviors, including mounting. Mounting is a behavior that many owners find embarrassing or even inappropriate. But, if done properly, it can be a fun and safe activity for both you and your dog. In this article, we’ll explain how to train a dog to mount you and why it’s important to be consistent and patient with the process.

<h2>What is Mounting?</h2>

Mounting is a behavior that many dogs exhibit. It typically involves a dog standing on its hind legs and placing its front paws on a person, another animal, or an object. This behavior is usually seen in male dogs, but it can also be seen in female dogs and even puppies. The act of mounting usually has an underlying sexual motive, but it can also be a sign of dominance or a sign of playfulness.

<h2>Why Do Dogs Mount?</h2>

Dogs mount for a variety of reasons. It can be a sign of playfulness, dominance, or even sexual behavior. Playful mounting is most often seen in puppies and adolescent dogs. It may look and sound aggressive, but it’s often a sign of a dog wanting to play or get attention. Dominance mounting is typically seen in adult dogs and is a sign of the dog trying to establish their dominance over another dog or person. Lastly, sexual mounting is usually seen in adult male dogs and is a sign of sexual arousal.

Training your dog to mount you on command can be beneficial for a variety of reasons. It can be a fun, safe activity for you and your dog to do together. It can also help to strengthen the bond between you and your dog. Additionally, it can be a useful behavior for dog shows or agility competitions. 

<h2>How to Train a Dog to Mount You</h2>

The first step in training your dog to mount you is to get your dog comfortable with standing on its hind legs. Start by asking your dog to sit, then hold a treat in front of its nose and slowly move it up. Your dog will naturally follow the treat with its nose, raising its body up until it’s standing on its hind legs. Once your dog is standing, give it the treat and praise it. Repeat this process several times until your dog is comfortable standing on its hind legs.

Once your dog is comfortable standing on its hind legs, you can move on to teaching it the “mount” command. Start by having your dog sit, then hold a treat in front of its nose and move it slowly up your body. As your dog follows the treat, it should climb up your body until it’s standing on its hind legs. Once it’s standing, give it the treat and praise it. After a few repetitions, your dog should start to understand that when you say “mount”, it’s supposed to climb up your body.

Once your dog is reliably responding to the “mount” command, you can start to practice it with other people. Start by having the person stand in front of your dog and hold a treat in front of its nose. Then, give the “mount” command and have the person slowly move the treat up their body. As your dog follows the treat, it should climb up their body until it’s standing on its hind legs. Once it’s standing, give it the treat and praise it.
