<p>A Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is a valuable benefit offered by many employers. It allows employees to set aside a portion of their pre-tax salary to cover eligible medical expenses. With an FSA, you can save money on out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses, dental care, vision care, and more. </p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of an FSA?</h2>

<p>An FSA provides many benefits that make it an attractive option for those who are looking for ways to save on medical costs. With an FSA, you can save money on out-of-pocket medical expenses, including: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Prescription drugs</li>
  <li>Over-the-counter medications</li>
  <li>Dental care</li>
  <li>Vision care (e.g. glasses, contact lenses, and eye exams)</li>
  <li>Medical supplies (e.g. bandages, crutches, and braces)</li>
  <li>Lab fees</li>
  <li>Medical equipment (e.g. wheelchairs and walkers)</li>
  <li>Mental health care (e.g. counseling and therapy)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the savings on out-of-pocket medical costs, an FSA also offers other benefits. For example, funds in an FSA are not subject to federal income tax, Social Security taxes, or Medicare taxes. Furthermore, funds in an FSA are portable—that is, they can be used to cover medical expenses for you, your spouse, and your dependents, regardless of where you work. </p>

<h2>How Does an FSA Work?</h2>

<p>An FSA is a type of savings account that is funded by pre-tax deductions from your paycheck. You can contribute up to $2,750 per year to an FSA (this limit may be higher in some cases). When you incur eligible medical expenses, you can submit a claim to your FSA plan administrator for reimbursement. It’s important to note that you must submit claims for reimbursement within a certain timeframe (typically 90 days). </p>

<h2>What Expenses Are Not Covered by an FSA?</h2>

<p>It’s important to note that not all medical expenses are eligible for reimbursement from an FSA. For example, insurance premiums, cosmetic surgery, and fertility treatments are not eligible for reimbursement. In addition, expenses that are deemed to be for the “comfort or convenience” of the patient (e.g. non-prescription vitamins and supplements) are not eligible for reimbursement. Lastly, expenses related to services that are not medically necessary (e.g. gym memberships, massage therapy, and acupuncture) are not eligible for reimbursement. </p>

<h2>What Are My Responsibilities When Using an FSA?</h2>

<p>When using an FSA, it is important to keep accurate records of all eligible expenses. You should save all receipts and other documentation, such as doctor’s notes, prescriptions, and lab results. In addition, you should submit claims for reimbursement within the timeframe specified by your plan administrator. Lastly, you should be aware of the “use it or lose it” rule. If you do not use all of the funds in your FSA by the end of the plan year, you will forfeit the unused funds. </p>

<h2>How Can I Get Started With an FSA?</h2>

<p>If you are interested in setting up an FSA, the first step is to contact your employer to find out if they offer an FSA plan. If your employer does offer an FSA plan, they should provide you with information on how to enroll. Once you have enrolled in an FSA plan, you can begin contributing pre-tax funds to the plan. </p>
