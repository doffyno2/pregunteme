<p>The Sims 4 is a popular life simulation game that allows players to create and control virtual people called Sims. As with real life, Sims need to take care of their hygiene, and this includes giving their pets a bath from time to time. In this article, we'll explain how to give a dog a bath in Sims 4.</p>

<h2>What You Need</h2>

<p>Before you give your dog a bath, you'll need to make sure you have the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A bathtub or shower</li>
  <li>Dog shampoo</li>
  <li>A towel</li>
  <li>A brush</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing for the Bath</h2>

<p>Before you give your dog a bath, you'll need to get the bathroom ready. Make sure you have all the necessary items, and that the bathroom is clean. Once the bathroom is ready, you can start to prepare your dog for the bath.</p>

<p>You should start by brushing your dog's fur. This will help remove any dirt or debris that is stuck in the fur. It's also a good idea to trim your dog's nails before the bath, as this will help prevent any scratches or injuries that may occur during the bath.</p>

<h2>Bathing Your Dog</h2>

<p>Now that you're ready to give your dog a bath, you'll need to fill the bathtub or shower with warm water. Once the water is ready, you can start to bathe your dog. Start by wetting your dog's fur with the warm water, and then apply the dog shampoo. Make sure you lather it up well and work it into the fur. Once you're done, rinse the shampoo off with warm water.</p>

<p>Once the shampoo is washed off, you can start to dry your dog with the towel. Make sure you dry the fur thoroughly, as any excess water can lead to skin irritation. Once the fur is dry, you can brush it again to ensure that it's free of dirt and debris.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Giving your dog a bath in Sims 4 is a relatively simple process. Just make sure you have all the necessary items, and that the bathroom is clean before you start. Once you've prepared your dog for the bath, you can start to bathe them. Make sure you use a mild shampoo and rinse it off thoroughly.
