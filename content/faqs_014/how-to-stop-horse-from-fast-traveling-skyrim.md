<p>Skyrim is an incredibly popular role-playing game with a vast open world. Players can explore the world of Tamriel for hours, taking on quests and discovering new locations. One of the best ways to explore the world of Skyrim is by horseback, but sometimes your horse can move too quickly and make it difficult to explore. Fortunately, there are a few ways to slow down your horse and keep it from fast travelling.</p>

<h2>Disable Fast Travel</h2>

<p>The easiest way to stop your horse from fast travelling is to simply disable fast travel. This can be done by opening the game’s main menu and selecting the “Options” tab. From there, you can toggle the “Fast Travel” option to “Off”. This will disable fast travel for all forms of transportation, including horses. This is a great option if you want to explore the world of Skyrim at a leisurely pace.</p>

<h2>Use the Whistle Command</h2>

<p>If you are using a horse in Skyrim and want to slow it down, the Whistle command can be a great option. To use the Whistle command, simply press the “Whistle” button on your controller. This will cause your horse to slow down and stop moving. You can then take control of the horse and continue on your journey. This is a great way to keep your horse from fast travelling, as it gives you full control over the horse’s speed.</p>

<h2>Use a Bridle</h2>

<p>Another way to keep your horse from fast travelling is to use a bridle. A bridle is an item of horse tack that is used to control a horse’s speed.

This is a great way to keep your horse from fast travelling, as you can keep it at a leisurely pace.</p>
