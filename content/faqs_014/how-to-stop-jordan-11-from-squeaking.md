How to Stop Jordan 11 From Squeaking

Squeaky shoes can prove to be a real nuisance, especially when you’re walking around and all you can hear is the annoying sound of your shoes squeaking every time you take a step. Jordan 11s are known for their quality, comfort and style, but they can also be quite noisy. If you’ve ever owned a pair of Jordan 11s and experienced this problem, read on to learn how to stop your Jordan 11s from squeaking. 



Before you can learn how to stop your Jordan 11s from squeaking, you need to know what causes them to squeak in the first place. In most cases, the squeaking sound is caused by friction between the upper and the midsole of the shoe. This friction can be caused by a number of factors, including the following: 

<h2>Worn Out Soles</h2>

One of the most common causes of squeaking in Jordan 11s is worn out soles. Over time, the rubber on the sole of the shoe will slowly wear away, leaving the midsole exposed. This can create a lot of friction between the upper and the midsole, causing the shoe to squeak. 

<h2>Loose Insoles</h2>

Another common cause of squeaking in Jordan 11s is loose insoles. If the insoles are not properly secured to the shoe, they can move around and create friction with the upper. This is especially common in older shoes where the insoles may have become worn out and lost their grip. 

<h2>Tight Shoes</h2>

Tight shoes can also cause squeaking. If the upper of the shoe is too tight, it can create friction with the midsole as you walk, resulting in a squeaking sound. This is especially true if the upper material is not flexible or breathable. 



Now that you know what causes Jordan 11s to squeak, it’s time to learn how to stop them from squeaking. Here are a few tips that can help you stop your Jordan 11s from squeaking: 

<h2>Clean and Condition the Shoes</h2>

The first step to stopping squeaking in your Jordan 11s is to clean and condition the shoes. Use a shoe cleaner or a mild soap and water solution to clean the upper of the shoe, then use a leather conditioner to condition the upper and midsole. This will help to reduce the friction between the upper and the midsole, and can help to reduce or eliminate the squeaking sound. 

<h2>Replace the Insoles</h2>

If your insoles are worn out or loose, replacing them can help to reduce or eliminate the squeaking sound. Make sure to purchase insoles that are designed specifically for your Jordan 11s, as different models and sizes may have different sized insoles. 

<h2>Use a Silicone Spray</h2>

A silicone spray can also help to reduce or eliminate the squeaking sound in your Jordan 11s. Simply spray the upper and midsole of the shoes with a silicone spray and let it dry before wearing them. This will help to reduce the friction between the upper and midsole and can help to reduce or eliminate the squeaking sound. 

<h2>Use a Shoe Horn</h2>

Using a shoe horn can also help to reduce the squeaking sound in your Jordan 11s. A shoe horn will help to reduce the friction between the upper and midsole, and can help to reduce or eliminate the squeaking sound. 

<h2>Use Inserts</h2>

Inserts can also be used to reduce the squeaking sound in your Jordan 11s. Inserts are designed to fit between the upper and midsole of the shoe, and can help to reduce the friction between the two. This will help to reduce or eliminate the squeaking sound. 

<h2>Choose the Right Size</h2>

Finally, it’s important to make sure you choose the right size when buying Jordan 11s. If the shoes are too tight, they can create friction between the upper and midsole and cause the shoes to squeak. Make sure to choose a size that fits comfortably and allows your feet to move freely.
