<p>Finding your perfect top size can be difficult, especially if you're shopping online. Without being able to try on clothes, you'll need to measure your body to determine your size. To find the best fit, you'll need to measure your body and use a sizing chart to find your top size. With a few simple measurements, you can find the top length that will give you the perfect fit.</p>

<h2>Steps to Measure Top Length</h2>

<p>Measuring your top length is the first step to finding the perfect fit. To measure the length of your top, take the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start by measuring your neck circumference. To do this, wrap the measuring tape around the back of your neck and measure to your shoulder.</li>
<li>Next, measure from the base of your neck to the bottom of your ribcage. Wrap the measuring tape around the fullest part of your ribcage, and then measure from the base of your neck to the bottom of the ribcage.</li>
<li>Finally, measure from your shoulder to the bottom of your ribcage. Wrap the measuring tape around the fullest part of your ribcage, and then measure from your shoulder to the bottom of the ribcage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Your Measurements to Find Your Size</h2>

<p>Once you've taken all of your measurements, you can use them to find your top length. Most sizing charts provide the neck to shoulder measurements and the shoulder to ribcage measurements in inches, so you'll need to convert your measurements to inches if they weren't originally taken in that unit of measurement. Once you have all of your measurements in inches, you can use them to find your size in the sizing chart.</p>

<p>When using a sizing chart to find your top length, look for the column with your neck to shoulder measurement. Then, look for the row with your shoulder to ribcage measurement. The size that intersects these two measurements is your top size.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Top Length</h2>

<p>When measuring your top length, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure that you are wearing the same type of clothing that you plan to wear with the top you're measuring for. This will ensure that you get an accurate measurement. Also, take your measurements with a measuring tape that is not too tight. Finally, if you're measuring for a top with a drop shoulder, you'll need to measure from the top of your shoulder instead of the base of your neck.</p>
