<p>Removing Race Face Aeffect cranks is a relatively straightforward job and can be done in a few simple steps. However, it is important to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the job is done correctly and safely.</p>

<p>The first step is to make sure that the crankset is properly secured. This can be done by taking the necessary tools such as a wrench and an Allen key and tightening the bolts that are located on the bottom of the crankset.</p>

<p>Once the crankset is securely fastened, the next step is to loosen the crank arms from the bottom bracket spindle. This can be done by using an Allen key and loosening the crank arm bolts. Once the bolts are loosened, the crank arms can be removed from the spindle.</p>

<p>The third step is to remove the chainrings from the crank arms. This can be done by using a chainring removal tool. The chainring removal tool should be inserted between the chainring and the crank arm and the chainring should be twisted off.</p>

<p>The fourth step is to remove the bottom bracket from the frame. This can be done by using an appropriate bottom bracket removal tool. Depending on the type of bottom bracket, the tool may need to be inserted between the bottom bracket and the frame and then twisted off.</p>
