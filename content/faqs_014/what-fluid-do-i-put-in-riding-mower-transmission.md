<h2>What is the Purpose of Transmission Fluid in a Riding Mower?</h2>

Transmission fluid is a lubricant that helps the transmission of a riding mower operate smoothly.

If you have an automatic transmission, then you should use automatic transmission fluid (ATF). If you have a manual transmission, then you should use gear oil. It is important to use the correct type of fluid, as using the wrong type of fluid can damage the transmission.
