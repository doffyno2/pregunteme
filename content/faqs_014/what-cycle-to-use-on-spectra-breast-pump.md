One of the most common questions among breastfeeding moms is what cycle to use on their Spectra breast pump. The right cycle to use depends on a few factors, including the age of the baby, the mother’s milk supply, and the purpose of the pumping session. In this article, we’ll look at the different cycles on the Spectra breast pump and how to use them.

<h2>What is a Breast Pump?</h2>

A breast pump is a device that helps breastfeeding mothers express milk from their breasts. It works by creating suction and mimicking the baby’s mouth to draw out milk from the breast. Breast pumps typically come with a variety of settings and accessories, such as bottles, tubing, flanges, and valves.

<h2>Types of Breast Pump Cycles</h2>

The Spectra breast pump has three basic types of cycles: stimulation, expression, and massage. Each cycle has a different purpose and should be used differently.

<h3>Stimulation Cycle</h3>

The stimulation cycle is used to stimulate the breasts and encourage milk production. This cycle is designed to mimic a baby’s suckling action and is best used when starting a pumping session. The stimulation cycle should be used for a few minutes before switching to the expression cycle.

<h3>Expression Cycle</h3>

The expression cycle is used to draw out milk from the breasts. This cycle should be used for the majority of the pumping session. The expression cycle is designed to mimic the baby’s sucking action and should be used for about 10 minutes.

<h3>Massage Cycle</h3>

The massage cycle is used to help relieve breast pain or discomfort. This cycle is designed to massage the breasts and can help increase milk production. The massage cycle should be used for a few minutes at the end of the pumping session.
