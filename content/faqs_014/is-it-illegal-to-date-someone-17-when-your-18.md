<p>Dating someone who is significantly younger or older than you can be a tricky situation, especially if you are both below the legal age of consent. Depending on the jurisdiction, the legal age of consent ranges from 16 to 18 years old. In the United States, the age of consent is 18. This means that if you are 18 years or older, it is illegal for someone who is 17 or younger to have any type of sexual contact with you.</p>
