Unfortunately, many plastic bottles are printed with logos and other information, leaving an unsightly mark on the bottle that is difficult to remove. While it may seem impossible to remove the print from plastic bottles, there are a few steps you can take to help make the process easier.</p>

It is important to use caution when using solvents, as they can be dangerous if misused. Start by applying a small amount of the solvent to a cloth or cotton swab and gently rub the print in a circular motion. If the print does not come off immediately, apply a bit more of the solvent and try again.</p>
