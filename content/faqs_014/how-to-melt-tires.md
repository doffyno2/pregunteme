<p>Tires are made of rubber, a material known for its durability and resistance to heat. But when it comes to melting tires, the process can be tricky. If you’re looking to melt tires for a project or to repurpose them for another use, you’ll need to understand the process and the proper safety procedures. In this article, we’ll explore how to melt tires safely and effectively.</p>
