<p>Dead by Daylight is a survival horror video game developed by Behavior Interactive. Players take on the role of either a killer or one of four survivors trying to escape from a gruesome killer. The game features a variety of different levels, each with its own unique set of challenges. One of the most important features of the game is the ability to repair generators. Generators are necessary for the survivors to open the gates and escape, but they can be difficult to repair. In this article, we will discuss how to repair a generator in Dead by Daylight.</p>

<h2>What are Generators and Why are They Important?</h2>

<p>Generators are special objects found in Dead by Daylight that the survivors must repair in order to escape.

Once the repair process has begun, the survivors must complete a mini-game in order to finish the repair. If the survivors are successful, the generator will be fully repaired, and the survivors will be able to open the gates and escape.</p>

<p>Generators are important because they are the only way for the survivors to escape. Without them, the survivors will be trapped and at the mercy of the killer. It is therefore important that the survivors know how to repair the generators in order to maximize their chances of escape.</p>
