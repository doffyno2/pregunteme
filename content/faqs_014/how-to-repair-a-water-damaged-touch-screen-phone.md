<p>We all know how annoying it can be when our phones get water damaged. Not only is it difficult to fix, but it can also be expensive and time-consuming to repair. Luckily, there are some things you can do to try and fix your water damaged touch screen phone, without having to pay a fortune. So, if you’re looking for a way to repair your water damaged phone, then read on to learn more.</p>

<h2>What to Do if Your Phone Gets Water Damaged</h2>

<p>The first thing you should do if your touch screen phone has gotten water damaged is to immediately turn it off. You should also remove the battery, if possible. This will help to prevent any further damage to the phone. Once the phone is off and the battery is removed, you’ll want to dry off the phone as best you can. This can be done with a paper towel or a cloth. You want to make sure you don’t use any chemical cleaners on your phone as they could potentially damage it further.</p>

<p>Once your phone is dry, you’ll want to place it in a container of rice or silica gel. This will help to absorb any moisture that may still be in the phone. You should leave the phone in the container for at least 24 hours. This will help to ensure that all the moisture is absorbed out of the phone and that it is completely dry before you try to turn it back on.</p>

<h2>What Not to Do if Your Phone Gets Water Damaged</h2>

<p>When it comes to repairing water damaged touch screen phones, there are a few things you should avoid doing. For starters, you should never try to turn the phone on while it is still wet. This could potentially cause more damage to the phone and make it more difficult to repair. You should also avoid using any type of heat to dry out the phone, as this could also cause further damage.</p>

<p>Additionally, you should never use any type of chemical cleaner on your phone. This could potentially damage the phone further and make it more difficult to repair. Lastly, you should never try to open up the phone or attempt any type of repair on it yourself. Unless you are a trained technician, it is best to leave any repairs to the professionals.</p>

<h2>What to Expect After Repairing a Water Damaged Touch Screen Phone</h2>

<p>Once the phone has been dried out and placed in a container of rice or silica gel, you can try to turn it back on. However, you should not be surprised if the phone does not turn on or if it does not function properly. This is because water damage can cause a variety of issues with a phone, from shorting out the battery to corrupting the internal components. As such, it is important to be aware that repair may not be successful and that you may need to purchase a new phone.</p>

<h2>How to Avoid Water Damage in the Future</h2>

<p>The best way to protect your phone from water damage is to keep it away from water as much as possible. This means avoiding bringing your phone into the shower, near pools or hot tubs, or any other area where it could potentially get wet. Additionally, you should make sure to use a waterproof case when you are near water or in an area where your phone could potentially get wet.
