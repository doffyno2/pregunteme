<p>Pollock is a popular fish that is widely consumed by humans and can also be a great source of nutrition for our canine friends. It is low in fat and packed with essential vitamins and minerals that can help keep your dog healthy and happy. But is pollock good for dogs? Let’s take a look at what pollock can do for your pup.</p>

<h2>What Is Pollock?</h2>

<p>Pollock is a species of fish found in the North Pacific Ocean. It is closely related to cod and has a mild, slightly sweet flavor. It is a member of the cod family and is often confused with other whitefish such as haddock and whiting. Pollock is sometimes referred to as “Alaskan cod” and is a common ingredient in many dishes.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits Of Pollock For Dogs</h2>

<p>Pollock is a good source of lean protein for your pup, providing up to 20% of the daily recommended amount. It is also low in fat and contains essential vitamins and minerals such as Vitamin B12, phosphorus, and selenium. Vitamin B12 is important for proper red blood cell formation, while phosphorus helps maintain healthy bones and teeth. Selenium helps with the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates, as well as aiding in the prevention of certain illnesses.</p>

<p>Pollock is also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help keep your pup’s coat healthy and shiny. Omega-3 fatty acids can also help with joint health, heart health, and the immune system. Pollock is also low in mercury and is considered a safe fish to feed your pup.</p>

<h2>How To Feed Pollock To Your Dog?</h2>

<p>Pollock can be served cooked or raw, and it can be a great addition to your pup’s diet. It is important to be aware of any possible allergens when preparing fish for your pup. If your pup has any food allergies, it is best to consult your veterinarian before introducing pollock into their diet.</p>

<p>If you are serving cooked pollock, make sure it is thoroughly cooked and has no bones. You can serve it plain or mix it with some cooked brown rice or other grains for a nutrient-packed meal. If your pup prefers raw food, you can feed them raw pollock but it is important to freeze it first to kill any parasites. If you do feed your pup raw pollock, make sure it is fresh and has not been sitting out too long.</p>

<p>It is also important to portion control when feeding your pup pollock. Too much fish can lead to an upset stomach, so make sure to follow your veterinarian’s recommendations when it comes to portion sizes.</p>
