<h2>How To Teach Your Dog To Hop</h2>

<p>If your dog is a bit more hesitant, you can try using a tennis ball or other toy to encourage them to hop. Place the toy a few feet away from your dog and then have them run towards it and then hop over it. This is a fun way to help your dog learn to hop, and it will also help them get used to the feeling of hopping. You can also use a stick or a pole to help them practice the command by having them jump over it.</p>
