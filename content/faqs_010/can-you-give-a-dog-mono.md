Mononucleosis, also known as “mono”, is a contagious virus that can be passed from person to person through saliva. Mono is most commonly seen in teenagers and young adults, but is it possible for a human to pass mono to their canine companion? Let’s take a closer look at this common virus and find out if it is indeed possible to give a dog mono.

<h2>What Is Mononucleosis?</h2>

Mononucleosis, also referred to as “mono” or “the kissing disease”, is an infectious disease caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is most commonly spread through saliva, but can also be spread through other bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and semen.

<h2>Can Dogs Get Mononucleosis?</h2>

The Epstein-Barr virus that causes mononucleosis is considered a human virus and is not known to infect dogs.
