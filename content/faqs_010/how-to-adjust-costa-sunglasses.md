Costa sunglasses are among the most popular brands in the world. They offer a range of styles and colors that are fashionable and comfortable. But, if you want to make sure your sunglasses fit correctly, you'll need to make some adjustments. This article will explain the steps you need to take to adjust your Costa sunglasses for a perfect fit.

<h2>Step 1: Check the Fit</h2>

Before you start adjusting your sunglasses, take a few minutes to check the fit. Make sure the arms of the sunglasses fit snugly against your head and don’t slide down your nose. If the sunglasses don’t feel comfortable, you may need to make some adjustments.

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the Nose Bridge</h2>

The nose bridge is the part of the sunglasses that rests against your nose. To adjust the bridge, you’ll need to use a small screwdriver. Gently twist the screws on either side of the bridge to adjust the angle of the bridge. This will help make sure the sunglasses rest comfortably against your nose.

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Arms</h2>

The arms of your sunglasses should fit comfortably behind your ears. To adjust the arms, you’ll need to use a small screwdriver. Gently twist the screws on either side of the arms to adjust the angle of the arms. This will help make sure the sunglasses fit securely behind your ears.

<h2>Step 4: Check the Fit</h2>

Once you’ve made the adjustments, take a few minutes to check the fit again. Make sure the sunglasses feel comfortable and don’t slide down your nose. If the fit is still not comfortable, make any additional adjustments that are necessary.
