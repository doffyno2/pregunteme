<p>Ladder ball is a game that can be enjoyed by both children and adults alike. The game is simple and easy to set up, and can be a great way to get some outdoor fun going. But before you can get started, itâ€™s important to know how far apart the ladders should be for a safe and successful game. </p>

<p>The standard distance for a ladder ball set up is 24 feet apart, from one ladder to the other. This should be measured from the base of the ladder, so that the distance is exactly the same all the way up. You should also make sure that the ladders are placed exactly perpendicular to each other, and that the two ladders should be at least 5 feet away from any walls or other objects. </p>

<p>When setting up the ladders, make sure that they are both stable and secured properly. This means that they should be set up on a flat and even surface, and that the legs should be firmly secured in the ground. If you plan to use stakes to secure the ladders, make sure that they are placed in the ground at least 12 inches deep. This will ensure that the ladders won't be easily knocked over during game play. </p>

<p>Once the ladders are set up, you can then proceed to attach the bolas. The bolas should be attached to the top of the ladder, and should be even with the top of the ladder. The bolas should be securely attached, as they can be a hazard if they come loose during game play. </p>

<p>In addition to the standard 24 feet apart setup, there are other factors to consider when setting up your ladder ball. For example, if you are playing with younger children, you may want to reduce the distance between the ladders to 18 feet or even 12 feet. This will make it easier for younger players to reach the bolas. If you are playing with adults, you can increase the distance to as much as 30 feet. </p>
