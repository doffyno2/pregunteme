<p>Traveling can be a stressful experience, especially when it comes to packing and preparing for a flight. With Delta, passengers can make their trip smoother by pre-paying for checked baggage before arriving at the airport. This article will explain how to add checked baggage to Delta flights and the associated fees.</p>

<h2>What is Checked Baggage?</h2>

<p>Checked baggage is any luggage that passengers must check-in with an airline prior to boarding their flight. This typically includes suitcases, duffel bags, and other large items that cannot be taken on the plane in the cabin. When a passenger is traveling with checked baggage, they must pay the associated fees when they book their ticket or at the airport prior to boarding their flight. </p>

<h2>How to Add Checked Baggage to Delta Flights</h2>

<p>When booking a Delta flight, passengers can add checked baggage to their ticket by selecting the “Baggage” option in the booking process. Here, passengers will be asked how many bags they plan on checking, what type of bags they plan to check, and their weight and size. Each bag must meet Delta’s size and weight restrictions, which can be found on their website. If a bag does not meet the size and weight requirements, Delta may charge an oversized bag fee or refuse to check the bag for the flight.</p>

<h2>When to Add Checked Baggage to Delta Flights</h2>

<p>When booking a Delta flight, it is best to add checked baggage at the time of booking. By adding checked baggage during the booking process, passengers can save money on the associated fees. Delta charges a fee for checked baggage that increases the closer it is to departure time. Additionally, passengers who book their checked bags as part of their ticket are exempt from certain fees and charges that they would otherwise incur at the airport.</p>

<h2>Delta Checked Baggage Fees</h2>

<p>Delta charges a fee for each checked bag that a passenger brings on their flight. The fee for the first checked bag is $30 and the fee for the second checked bag is $40. Any additional bags will be charged at $150 per bag. In addition to the checked bag fee, passengers may also be charged a fee for bringing an oversized or overweight bag. Delta’s size and weight restrictions can be found on their website. </p>

<h2>How to Avoid Delta Checked Baggage Fees</h2>

<p>Delta offers a variety of ways to avoid paying checked baggage fees. Passengers who hold a Delta SkyMiles credit card can get their first checked bag for free. Additionally, passengers who select a Delta Comfort+ or First Class ticket can also check one bag for free. Additionally, Delta offers a “Pay with Miles” option that allows passengers to pay for their checked bags with miles instead of cash. </p>
