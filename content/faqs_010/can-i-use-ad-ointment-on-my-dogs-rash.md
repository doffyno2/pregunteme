<p>If your dog is suffering from a rash, you may be wondering if it is safe to apply ointment to their skin. After all, humans frequently use ointment for skin conditions, and it seems like it could be a good option for your pup too. However, it is important to understand that dogs are different from humans and that some ointments may not be safe for them.
