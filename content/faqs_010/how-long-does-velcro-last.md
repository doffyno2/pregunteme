How Long Does Velcro Last?

Velcro is a product that has been around for decades and is still a popular product for many applications. It is often used to attach two surfaces together that may otherwise be difficult to keep together. It is also used for a variety of home and office projects. But how long does velcro last?

The answer to this question depends on the type of velcro being used and the environment in which it is used. In general, velcro can last anywhere from two to ten years depending on the type of velcro and the conditions it is exposed to.

The most common type of velcro is the hook and loop variety, which is most often found in clothing or other everyday items. This type of velcro will usually last around two to three years with regular use. However, if the velcro is exposed to extreme temperatures or humidity, it may deteriorate more quickly.

The next type of velcro is the adhesive variety, which is typically used for items that need to be attached to a surface. This type of velcro can last up to ten years if it is used in a controlled environment. However, if the velcro is exposed to extreme temperatures or humidity, it may not last as long.

Finally, there is the industrial grade velcro, which is typically used in manufacturing or other industrial settings. This type of velcro can last up to twenty years if it is used in a controlled environment. Again, if the velcro is exposed to extreme temperatures or humidity, it may not last as long.
