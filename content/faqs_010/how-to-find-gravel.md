<p>Gravel is a versatile type of aggregate material that can be used in a range of outdoor projects. Whether you’re looking to create a driveway, pathway, or border for your garden, gravel is a great choice. It’s durable, low-maintenance, and easy to install – here’s how to get started.</p>

<h2>What is Gravel?</h2>

<p>Gravel is a type of coarse aggregate, made from crushed rocks and stones. It comes in a variety of sizes and types, from small pebbles to large boulders. Gravel can be used for a variety of outdoor projects, such as driveways, pathways, gardens, and more.</p>

<h2>Types of Gravel</h2>

<p>Gravel comes in a variety of types, each with its own unique characteristics. Some of the most common types of gravel include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pea gravel – small, round stones, usually about 1/4 inch in size.</li>
<li>Crushed stone – angular, crushed rocks, usually about 1/2 inch in size.</li>
<li>River rock – larger, smooth stones, usually about 1-2 inches in size.</li>
<li>Decomposed granite – small pieces of granite, usually about 1/4 inch in size.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to Buy Gravel</h2>

<p>Gravel is available from home improvement stores and landscape suppliers, as well as from online retailers. Before you make a purchase, it’s important to consider the type of gravel you need, as well as the amount. Gravel is usually sold by the cubic yard or by the ton, so be sure to check the measurements before buying.</p>

<h2>How to Install Gravel</h2>

<p>Installing gravel is relatively easy, but it does require some preparation. Before you start, you’ll need to measure the area you’ll be covering and calculate how much gravel you’ll need. You’ll also need to clear the area of any existing vegetation, rocks, and debris, as well as level the ground to ensure that the gravel is evenly dispersed.</p>

<p>Once you’ve prepared the area, you can start laying the gravel. Start by spreading a layer of gravel about 3 inches deep, then use a rake to even it out. You can then add additional layers, if necessary, to build up the height of the gravel. Once you’ve finished, use a broom or rake to give the gravel a finished look.</p>

<h2>Tips for Installing Gravel</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you’re installing a gravel driveway or pathway, be sure to use a weed barrier underneath the gravel to prevent weeds from growing up through it.</li>
<li>If you’re using gravel in a garden bed, consider adding a border around the outside to keep the gravel in place.</li>
<li>Gravel is heavy, so be sure to calculate the amount you need carefully. Too much gravel can be difficult to remove, and too little can leave your project looking unfinished.</li>
<li>If you’re using gravel for a driveway or pathway, consider adding a layer of crushed stone or pea gravel underneath to help keep the gravel in place.</li>
</ul>
