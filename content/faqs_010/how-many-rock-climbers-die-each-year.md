Rock climbing is a thrilling and potentially dangerous activity. Many people enjoy it for its adrenaline rush and sense of accomplishment, but there is always a risk of injury or death. While many climbers take safety precautions and practice good technique, accidents still happen. So, how many rock climbers die each year?

<h2>How Many Rock Climbers Die Annually?</h2>

The number of rock climbing fatalities varies from year to year, but the National Safety Council estimated that in 2019, there were an estimated 18 deaths from rock climbing. This number is relatively small compared to other activities, such as skiing or mountain biking, which had an estimated 40 and 21 fatalities respectively. 

While the numbers may be small, the dangers of rock climbing should not be taken lightly. The most common cause of death when rock climbing is falling, and even experienced climbers can misjudge their abilities or the difficulty of the climb.

<h2>How to Reduce the Risk of Death When Rock Climbing</h2>

While there is always a risk of injury or death when climbing, there are some steps climbers can take to reduce the likelihood of an accident. 

First and foremost, be sure to take a climbing class or have an experienced climber show you the ropes. Even experienced climbers should take refresher courses periodically to stay up to date on the latest safety techniques and equipment.

It is also important to wear the proper safety gear, such as a harness and helmet. These pieces of equipment can help protect climbers from falls and other potential hazards.

Finally, it is important to be aware of the environment and the potential risks. Check for loose rocks or other hazards before beginning a climb, and be sure to keep an eye on the weather. High winds can make climbing more dangerous, especially when climbing high peaks.

<h2>How to Help Climbers Who Are Injured</h2>
