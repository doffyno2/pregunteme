<p>Motel rooms are a great way to get a comfortable, affordable night's sleep. Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, a motel room can provide you with a convenient and inexpensive place to stay. But how much does a motel room cost?</p>

<p>The cost of a motel room can vary greatly depending on the location, amenities, and quality of the motel. In general, however, you can expect to pay between $50 and $150 per night for a standard motel room. Prices may be higher in certain cities, such as New York or San Francisco, or during peak travel times. Additionally, amenities such as parking, Wi-Fi, and cable television may increase the cost of the room.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a bargain, you may be able to find discounts or special offers on motel room rates. It's also possible to negotiate a lower rate if you plan to stay for an extended period of time. Additionally, many motels offer discounts for AAA members, senior citizens, and members of the military. Some motels even provide discounts for those who book in advance.</p>

<p>When booking a motel room, be sure to check for any additional fees or taxes that might be added to the room rate. This can include resort fees, cleaning fees, or taxes such as sales tax or occupancy tax. Additionally, some motels may charge extra for amenities such as Wi-Fi, cable television, or parking.</p>

<p>In addition to the cost of the room itself, there may be additional costs associated with staying in a motel. For example, some motels charge a fee for each additional guest beyond two people. Additionally, there may be a fee for early check-in or late check-out. Some motels may even charge a fee for pets.</p>
