It is common for pet owners to be concerned about how their canine companion will act and feel after undergoing a spaying procedure. As a responsible pet parent, you want to make sure that your pup is as comfortable and healthy as possible. One of the questions that many dog owners have after their pup has been spayed is “How long does a dog shake after being spayed?”

<h2>Why Do Dogs Shake After Being Spayed?</h2>

The primary reason why a dog may shake after being spayed is due to anesthesia. Anesthesia is a drug that is used to put the animal into a deep sleep, so it does not feel any pain during a medical procedure. It can take a few hours for the anesthesia to wear off, and during this time, the dog may shake or tremble. This is perfectly normal and is nothing to worry about.

<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Post-Operative Shaking?</h2>

The most common symptom of post-operative shaking is trembling. This can include shaking of the head, body, and/or legs. The trembling may be more noticeable when the dog is in a standing position or on a hard surface. Some dogs may also appear to be “drunk” and have difficulty walking. This is usually due to the effects of the anesthesia and should wear off after a few hours.

<h2>How Long Does the Shaking Last?</h2>

The length of time that a dog will shake after being spayed will depend on the type of anesthesia that was used and the individual dog’s metabolism. Generally, the shaking should wear off after a few hours. However, it may take up to 24 hours for the dog to return to its normal state.

<h2>What Should I Do if My Dog is Shaking After Being Spayed?</h2>

If your dog is shaking after being spayed, the most important thing to do is to make sure that they are comfortable. Place them on a soft surface and make sure that they are warm. If the shaking persists, contact your veterinarian for further instructions.

<h2>Are There Any Risks Associated With Post-Operative Shaking?</h2>

Post-operative shaking is usually not a cause for concern and should wear off after a few hours. However, if your dog is shaking more than usual or if the shaking persists for more than 24 hours, contact your veterinarian. In some cases, the shaking may be a sign of a reaction to the anesthesia or a more serious medical condition.
