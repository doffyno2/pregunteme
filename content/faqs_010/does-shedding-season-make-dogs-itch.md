Every dog owner is familiar with the dreaded shedding season. It’s a time of year when our four-legged friends shed their winter coats and start growing a brand-new one. Unfortunately, shedding season can be a source of discomfort and irritation for our furry friends. In this article, we’ll take a look at the causes and symptoms of itching during shedding season, as well as some tips on how to manage it.

<h2>What Causes Dogs to Itch During Shedding Season?</h2>

Itching during shedding season is caused by a number of factors. For starters, the change in temperature can lead to dry skin, which can cause irritation and itching. The new hairs that are growing in can also irritate the skin, as can parasites such as fleas and ticks. Finally, allergies can also play a role, as many dogs suffer from pollen and food allergies that can cause itching during the shedding season. 

<h2>What are the Symptoms of Itching During Shedding Season?</h2>

The most common symptom of itching during shedding season is excessive scratching and biting of the skin. This is usually accompanied by redness, flakiness, and/or scabbing. If your dog is excessively licking or biting their fur, they may be trying to relieve the itching sensation. Other signs of itching may include excessive shedding, dandruff, and dry, scaly skin. 

<h2>How Can You Manage Itching During Shedding Season?</h2>

Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to help manage itching during shedding season. The first step is to make sure your dog is kept well-groomed. Regular brushing can help remove dead skin and hair, as well as stimulate the production of natural oils that will help keep the skin healthy. You should also use a shampoo specifically designed for dogs, as this will help keep their skin and coat in top condition. Additionally, you should make sure to keep your dog’s environment clean and free of dust and debris, which can contribute to itching. 

<h2>Are There Any Home Remedies for Itching?</h2>

There are a few home remedies that can help soothe itching during shedding season. For starters, you can try a natural oatmeal bath, which can help soothe dry, itchy skin. You can also try adding a few drops of essential oils such as lavender or chamomile to your dog’s bathwater, which can help provide relief from itching. Finally, you can try using a homemade spray made from apple cider vinegar and water, which can help reduce irritation and itching. 

<h2>Should You See a Vet for Itching During Shedding Season?</h2>

If your dog’s itching persists despite home remedies, it’s a good idea to see a vet for further evaluation. Your vet may recommend medications or other treatments to help reduce itching.
