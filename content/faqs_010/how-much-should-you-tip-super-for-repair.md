<p>It's common to tip a super when they provide a service for you, but when it comes to repairs, the question of what to tip can be a bit more complicated. After all, you're already paying for a service and you don't want to break your budget. So, how much should you tip a super for repair?</p>

<h2>What Is a Super?</h2>

<p>A super is a person responsible for the maintenance and repair of buildings or apartments. They usually work in the background and are responsible for making sure that the buildings and apartments are running smoothly and safely. They are in charge of making sure that all repairs are done correctly and that all safety checks are carried out. So, if you ever have any issues with your building or apartment, a super is the one to call.</p>

<h2>Why Should You Tip a Super for Repair?</h2>

<p>Tipping a super for repair is not always necessary, but it is a nice gesture and shows your appreciation for their time and efforts. Superintendents often work long hours and can be on call at any time of the day or night. Tipping a super is a small token of appreciation for all the work they do to keep our buildings and apartments safe and running smoothly.</p>

<h2>How Much Should You Tip a Super for Repair?</h2>

<p>When it comes to tipping a super for repair, it really depends on the situation. If the repair was minor, such as changing a lightbulb or fixing a plumbing issue, then a tip of $10-15 would be appropriate.

Of course, the amount you tip should always be within your budget and should never be more than you can afford.</p>

<h2>Other Considerations When Tipping a Super for Repair</h2>
