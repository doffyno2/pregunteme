<p>It can be difficult to figure out what year clothing was made. In some cases, it’s impossible to know with any certainty. But there are a few things you can try to determine the approximate age of your clothing. We'll look at how to identify the year of manufacture of clothes, as well as the differences between vintage and antique clothing.</p>

<h2>Look for Labels or Tags</h2>

<p>First, check the clothing for a label or tag. Labels and tags can provide clues as to the maker of the clothing and the year it was made. Some labels and tags will include a date, while others will include other identifying information such as a logo, trademark, or fabric content. Labels and tags that are printed directly onto the fabric of the clothing are usually more reliable than those sewn in.</p>

<h2>Identify the Fabric</h2>

<p>Next, identify the fabric the clothing is made from. Different fabrics were popular at different times, so knowing which fabric the clothing is made from can help you to estimate the age. For example, polyester was not widely used in clothing until the 1950s, so if the fabric is polyester then the clothing is likely from that era or later.</p>

<h2>Look for Clues in the Style and Construction</h2>

<p>The style and construction of clothing can also provide clues as to its age. Look for details such as buttons, zippers, and shoulder pads. These are all features that were popular in certain eras. For example, shoulder pads were popular in the 1980s, so if the clothing has shoulder pads then it is likely from the 1980s or later.</p>

<h2>Learn About Vintage and Antique Clothing</h2>

<p>It’s also important to understand the differences between vintage and antique clothing. Vintage clothing is generally considered to be at least 20 years old, while antique clothing is usually over 100 years old. For example, if the clothing is from the 1940s or earlier, it is considered to be antique.</p>

<h2>Check Online Resources and Clothing Databases</h2>

<p>If you’re still unsure of the age of the clothing, you can try searching online resources and clothing databases. These can provide information about the maker of the clothing and the year it was made. Some databases are comprehensive and include information about all types of clothing, while others are more specific and focus on particular eras or styles.</p>
