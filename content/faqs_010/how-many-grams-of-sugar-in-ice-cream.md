Ice cream is a delicious treat enjoyed by children and adults alike. But it may not be as innocent as it seems. Many people don’t realize that ice cream can contain high amounts of sugar. Let’s take a closer look at how much sugar is in ice cream and how to make a healthier version of this delicious treat.

<h2>What’s the Average Amount of Sugar in Ice Cream?</h2>

The average amount of sugar in ice cream varies by brand, flavor and serving size. To give you a better idea, the American Heart Association recommends that women have no more than 6 teaspoons of added sugar per day and men no more than 9 teaspoons.

A ½ cup serving of a popular ice cream brand contains 9-14 grams of added sugar, which is equal to 2-3 teaspoons. However, some brands of ice cream can contain up to 20 grams of added sugar in the same size serving.

<h2>What Kind of Sugar Is in Ice Cream?</h2>

The sugar in ice cream typically comes from one of two sources: added sugar or naturally occurring sugar. Added sugar is the sugar that is added to the recipe during the manufacturing process. It can come in the form of cane sugar, corn syrup, honey or other sweeteners. 

Naturally occurring sugar is found in the ingredients used to make the ice cream, such as milk and cream. This type of sugar is not added to the recipe and is typically found in lower amounts than added sugar.

<h2>What Are the Health Effects of Eating Too Much Sugar?</h2>

Consuming too much added sugar can have a negative impact on your health. Eating too much added sugar can contribute to weight gain and an increased risk of developing diabetes and heart disease. In addition, eating too much sugar can also cause cavities and other dental problems.
