<p>Landscape timbers are a great way to add a natural, rustic look to your outdoor space. They can be used to build retaining walls, raised beds, and outdoor structures like pergolas and gazebos. But before you can start building, you need to know how to fasten landscape timbers together. This article will provide you with the information you need to get started.</p>

<h2>Tools You'll Need</h2>

<p>Before you can begin fastening landscape timbers together, you'll need to gather a few tools. You'll need a drill and drill bits, a screwdriver, a saw, and some galvanized screws or nails. You may also want to have a tape measure and a level handy to help you measure and make sure your timber pieces are level.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Measure and Cut the Timbers</h3>

<p>The first step is to measure and cut the landscape timbers to the desired length. Use a tape measure and a saw to do this. Make sure the pieces are cut accurately, as this will ensure that your structure will be sturdy and level.</p>

<h3>2. Drill Pilot Holes</h3>

<h3>3. Insert Screws or Nails</h3>

<p>Now it's time to insert the screws or nails. Use a screwdriver or hammer to do this. Insert the screws or nails into the pilot holes, making sure they are secure and level. If you're using screws, make sure they are galvanized so they won't rust over time.</p>

<h3>4. Check Your Work</h3>

<p>Once all the screws or nails are inserted, take a look at your work to make sure everything is secure and level. If everything looks good, then you're done. Congratulations, you've successfully fastened landscape timbers together.</p>
