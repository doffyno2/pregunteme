<p>Caring for a dog can be a rewarding experience for both the pet and the pet parent. But if you’re a cannabis user, it can be tricky to keep your pet from smelling the plants you’re using. While it’s impossible to entirely eliminate the smell of weed from your pet’s vicinity, there are a few simple steps you can take to reduce the scent and keep your pet from getting too close to your stash. </p>

<h2>Clean Up After Yourself</h2>

<p>The first and most important step to keeping your pet from smelling weed is to always clean up after yourself. This means disposing of any cannabis related items, including joints, pipes, bongs, and grinders in a secure bin or container. Additionally, if you smoke indoors, make sure to open the windows to air out the room. You should also vacuum regularly to remove any lingering particles.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Strain</h2>

<p>When it comes to choosing the right type of cannabis for your pet, it’s important to select a strain that has a low odor. Indica-dominant strains tend to have a much milder scent than sativa-dominant strains, so these are generally your best option. Additionally, avoid using strains that contain terpenes, as these can be more difficult to mask. </p>

<h2>Use an Air Purifier</h2>

<p>An air purifier is a great way to reduce the smell of cannabis in your home. These small devices work by filtering the air and removing particles, smoke, and other odors. If you’re using a small space, such as a bedroom or bathroom, consider investing in a small air purifier. You can also use air fresheners or scented candles to help mask the smell. </p>

<h2>Keep Your Pet Away From Your Stash</h2>

<p>If you keep your cannabis in a bag or container, make sure to keep it out of your pet’s reach. You should also avoid leaving any cannabis related items in plain sight, as this can be tempting for your pet. If you’re using cannabis outdoors, keep your pet on a leash and make sure they don’t go near your stash. </p>

<h2>Invest in Odor-Proof Containers</h2>

<p>If you’re a frequent cannabis user, it may be worth investing in an odor-proof container for your stash. These specialized containers are designed to keep the smell of cannabis contained, even when the lid is open. They come in a variety of sizes and styles, so you can easily find one that fits your needs. </p>

<h2>Use Natural Remedies</h2>

<p>There are also a few natural remedies you can use to help keep your pet from smelling weed. For example, lavender essential oil is a natural deodorizer and can help reduce the smell of cannabis. You can also use baking soda to absorb any residual odors. Simply sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda on the floor and let it sit for a few hours before vacuuming it up. </p>

<h2>Keep Your Pet Busy</h2>

<p>Finally, if you want to keep your pet from smelling weed, it’s important to keep them busy. Make sure to provide plenty of toys and activities for your pet, such as walks, playtime, and even obedience training. This will distract them from any potential smells and keep them occupied. </p>
