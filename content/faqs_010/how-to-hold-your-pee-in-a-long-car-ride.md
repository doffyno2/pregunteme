<p>Are you dreading a long car ride, knowing that you’ll have to hold your pee for hours on end? Holding your pee can be uncomfortable and even painful, but there are ways to make it easier. Here are some tips on how to hold your pee in a long car ride.</p>

<h2>1. Prepare Ahead of Time</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to prepare for a long car ride is to make sure you’re hydrated and have an empty bladder before you set off.

This will help you stay hydrated during the car ride and also help you to hold your pee for longer.</p>

<h2>2. Don’t Drink Too Much</h2>
