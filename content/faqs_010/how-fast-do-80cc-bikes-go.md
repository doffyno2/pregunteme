<p>When it comes to the speed of a bike, the engine size is the most important factor to consider. An 80cc bike, also known as a "pocket bike," is a small, lightweight type of motorcycle that is designed specifically for speed. These bikes are typically used for racing, but they can also be used for recreational riding. So, how fast do 80cc bikes go?</p>

<p>In general, 80cc bikes can reach speeds of up to 70 mph depending on the make and model of the bike. Some models can reach even higher speeds, but this is rare. Most 80cc bikes are designed for racing, and they are typically not street legal in most states due to the high speeds they can reach. The majority of 80cc bikes have a maximum speed of about 45 mph, making them legal for racing but not for street use.</p>

<h2>What Factors Affect the Speed of an 80cc Bike?</h2>

<p>The speed of an 80cc bike is affected by several different factors, including the type of engine, the weight of the rider, and the terrain the bike is riding on. The type of engine used in an 80cc bike is the most important factor when it comes to determining its top speed. The two main types of engines used in 80cc bikes are two-stroke and four-stroke engines. Two-stroke engines are lighter and more powerful, and they are typically used in racing bikes. Four-stroke engines are heavier and less powerful, but they are more reliable and are often used in recreational bikes.</p>

<p>The weight of the rider is also an important factor when it comes to the speed of an 80cc bike. A heavier rider will cause the bike to accelerate more slowly, and the bike will reach a lower top speed. Conversely, a lighter rider will cause the bike to accelerate more quickly, and the bike will reach a higher top speed.</p>

<p>The terrain the bike is riding on is another factor that affects the speed of an 80cc bike. On flat terrain, the bike will typically reach its top speed more quickly than on hilly terrain. On hilly terrain, the bike will take longer to reach its top speed and will have a lower top speed overall.</p>

<h2>Are 80cc Bikes Street Legal?</h2>

<p>In most states, 80cc bikes are not street legal due to their high speeds. While some states do allow 80cc bikes to be ridden on public roads, these bikes are typically limited to a maximum speed of around 20 mph. This means that most 80cc bikes cannot be legally ridden on public roads, and they must be ridden on private property or at a racing track.</p>

<p>For those states that do allow 80cc bikes to be ridden on public roads, there are typically several restrictions in place. These restrictions vary from state to state, but they typically include age limits, helmet requirements, speed limits, and insurance requirements.</p>

<h2>What Is the Difference Between an 80cc Bike and a Motorcycle?</h2>

<p>The main difference between an 80cc bike and a motorcycle is the size and power of the engine. Motorcycles typically have larger engines that can reach higher speeds than 80cc bikes. In addition, motorcycles are typically heavier and more powerful than 80cc bikes, and they are designed for more than just racing.</p>

<p>Motorcycles are typically street legal in most states, while 80cc bikes are not. Motorcycles also typically have more safety features than 80cc bikes, and they are designed for longer rides. In contrast, 80cc bikes are typically lighter and more maneuverable than motorcycles, and they are designed for racing and short rides.</p>
