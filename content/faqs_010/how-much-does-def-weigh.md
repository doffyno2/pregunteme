<p>DeF, short for Deuterium Fluoride, is an important compound used in many industries and scientific research. It has a wide range of applications, from its use in chemical lasers to its role as a catalyst in certain reactions. But how much does a molecule of DeF weigh?</p>

<h2>What Is DeF?</h2>

<p>Deuterium Fluoride, also known as DeF, is a stable compound of two hydrogen atoms and one fluorine atom. It is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at room temperature. DeF is used in a variety of industrial, medical, and scientific applications, including chemical lasers, catalysts, and fluorescence. It is also used as a fuel in nuclear fusion.</p>

<h2>How Much Does DeF Weigh?</h2>

<p>A molecule of DeF weighs approximately 19.988 amu (atomic mass units). This is slightly more than the weight of two hydrogen atoms (2 x 1.0079 amu = 2.0158 amu) and one fluorine atom (1 x 18.998 amu = 18.998 amu). The total weight of a molecule of DeF is 21.9838 amu.</p>

<h2>What Is the Molecular Weight of Deuterium Fluoride?</h2>

<p>The molecular weight of Deuterium Fluoride is 19.988 amu. This is the weight of the entire compound, including both the hydrogen and fluorine atoms. </p>

<h2>What Is the Molar Mass of Deuterium Fluoride?</h2>

<p>The molar mass of Deuterium Fluoride is 19.988 g/mol. This is the mass of one mole of DeF molecules, or 6.022 x 10^23 molecules. </p>

<h2>What Is the Density of Deuterium Fluoride?</h2>

<p>The density of Deuterium Fluoride is 2.908 g/L at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This is slightly less than the density of liquid water, which is 1.00 g/mL. </p>

<h2>What Is the Boiling Point of Deuterium Fluoride?</h2>
