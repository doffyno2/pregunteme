<p>A torsion axle is an important component of many vehicles, including trailers, caravans, and fifth wheel recreational vehicles. It is designed to provide a smooth ride, even when it is carrying heavy loads. But, just how much travel does a torsion axle have?</p>

<p>Torsion axles consist of a steel spring, which is surrounded by a metal tube. This spring is designed to compress and release as the vehicle is driven over uneven terrain. The amount of travel that a torsion axle has depends on the type of spring used, the diameter of the spring, and the load the axle is carrying. Generally, torsion axles can provide up to five inches of travel.</p>

<p>The most common type of torsion axle is the leaf spring design. Leaf springs are made from several layers of metal and provide the most suspension travel. These axles are designed to be very durable and can handle heavy loads. They also provide a smoother ride than other torsion axles, making them ideal for use in recreational vehicles.</p>

<p>Another type of torsion axle is the coil spring design. Coil springs are made from a single layer of metal and provide less travel than leaf springs. Coil springs are less durable and can only handle light to medium loads. However, they are less expensive than leaf springs and can provide a smoother ride than other types of torsion axles.</p>

<p>The size of the torsion axle also affects the amount of travel it has. Generally, larger axles provide more travel than smaller ones. Also, the load capacity of the axle will affect the amount of travel it can provide. The more weight the axle can carry, the more travel it will have.</p>

<p>Torsion axles are designed to provide a safe and comfortable ride, even when carrying heavy loads. They are also designed to be durable and long-lasting. The amount of travel a torsion axle has depends on the type of spring used, the diameter of the spring, and the load capacity of the axle. Generally, torsion axles can provide up to five inches of travel.</p>
