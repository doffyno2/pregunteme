<p>The amount of power a 65 inch LED TV uses depends on the wattage of the television. LED TVs typically range from 50 watts to 200 watts. On average, a 65 inch LED TV uses about 107 watts of power. This can vary depending on the manufacturer, model, and settings of the television.</p>

<p>The wattage of the television is the amount of power it uses. The wattage is usually listed on the back of the television, or in the user manual. To calculate the amount of energy a 65 inch LED TV uses, you need to know the wattage of the television and the length of time it is used. For example, if the wattage of your 65 inch LED TV is 100 watts and it is used for two hours, it will use 200 watt-hours of energy.</p>

<p>To convert watt-hours to amps, you need to know the voltage of the TV. The voltage for most LED TVs is 120 volts. To calculate the amps, divide the watt-hours by the voltage. In this example, 200 watt-hours divided by 120 volts results in 1.67 amps.</p>

<p>The amount of amps a 65 inch LED TV uses will also depend on the settings of the TV. If the TV is set to a very bright setting, it will use more power than if it is set to a dimmer setting. Additionally, if the TV is connected to other devices, such as a gaming console or sound system, it will use more power than if it is not connected to any other devices.</p>

<h2>Does a 65 Inch LED TV Use More Power Than a Plasma TV?</h2>

<p>LED TVs typically use less power than plasma TVs. A 65 inch LED TV typically uses about 107 watts of power, while a 65 inch plasma TV typically uses about 160 watts of power. This means that a 65 inch LED TV uses about 33% less power than a 65 inch plasma TV.</p>

<p>LED TVs are more energy efficient than plasma TVs because they use LED backlighting instead of fluorescent backlighting. LED backlighting is more efficient and uses less power than fluorescent backlighting. Additionally, LED TVs use less power than plasma TVs because they have a higher contrast ratio and brighter colors.</p>

<h2>How Can I Reduce the Amount of Power My 65 Inch LED TV Uses?</h2>

<p>There are several ways to reduce the amount of power your 65 inch LED TV uses. Firstly, make sure the TV is set to a dimmer setting. This will decrease the amount of power the TV uses. Secondly, if you are not using the TV, turn it off. This will save power and reduce your electric bill.</p>

<p>Thirdly, if you are using devices with your TV, such as a gaming console or sound system, make sure to turn them off when you are not using them. This will help reduce the amount of power your TV uses. Finally, make sure the TV is properly ventilated and dust-free. This will help ensure that it runs efficiently and uses less power.</p>
