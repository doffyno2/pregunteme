<p>Flying can be an exciting and liberating experience, but there are certain restrictions in place when it comes to what you can and cannot bring onto an airplane. This includes items such as weapons, sharp objects, and even electronics. So, if youâ€™re wondering if you can take a flashlight on an airplane, the answer is yes, but it has to be a non-laser flashlight. </p>

<p>Having a flashlight on an airplane can be a great way to stay safe and secure during long flights. Flashlights can be used in case of a power outage, to find your way around the cabin in the dark, or even to signal for help in the event of an emergency. However, laser flashlights are not allowed on most airlines due to their potential to cause injury.</p>

<h2>What Kind of Flashlight Can You Take on an Airplane?</h2>

<p>The type of flashlight you can take on an airplane is limited to non-laser flashlights. Laser flashlights are not allowed due to their potential to cause injury or harm. This means that any flashlight with a laser component, such as a laser pointer, is not allowed on an airplane.</p>

<p>Non-laser flashlights are allowed on most airlines, but it is important to note that the size of the flashlight should not exceed 7 inches in length or 1 inch in diameter. This includes the battery compartment and any other parts. </p>

<p>It is also important to note that most airlines will not allow passengers to bring a larger than normal number of batteries on an airplane. This means that if you are carrying a flashlight, it is best to make sure that it does not require more than two batteries.</p>

<p>If you are bringing a larger flashlight with you, it is important to make sure that it is secured in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you. This will help to prevent the flashlight from being damaged during transit. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the flashlight is turned off and secured in a way that it cannot be accidentally turned on during transit. </p>
