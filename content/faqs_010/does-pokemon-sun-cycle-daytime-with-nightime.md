<p>In the world of the popular Pokemon series, the day-night cycle is an integral part of the game. Players can experience different Pokemon encounters depending on the time of day. With the release of Pokemon Sun, the game has incorporated the day-night cycle into the main story. In this article, we'll take a look at the day-night cycle in Pokemon Sun, how it works, and what players can expect from it. </p>

<h2>What Is a Day-Night Cycle?</h2>

<p>A day-night cycle is an in-game mechanic that causes the game world to change depending on the time of day. In most games, this is simply a cosmetic change that doesn't affect the gameplay. However, some games, such as Pokemon, use the day-night cycle to make certain Pokemon appear or disappear depending on the time of day.</p>

<h2>How Does the Day-Night Cycle Work in Pokemon Sun?</h2>

<p>In Pokemon Sun, the day-night cycle works in much the same way as it does in other Pokemon games. Depending on the time of day, different Pokemon will appear in the wild. For example, during the day, you may encounter Grass-type Pokemon, while at night you might find Bug-type Pokemon. Additionally, some Pokemon may only appear during certain times of day, such as the Fire-type Pokemon Slugma, which is only available during the day.</p>

<h2>What Else Does the Day-Night Cycle Affect?</h2>

<p>In addition to the types of Pokemon that can be encountered, the day-night cycle also affects certain NPCs in the game. For example, some NPCs may only appear during certain times of day, such as the night-time NPC who can teach certain moves to your Pokemon. Additionally, certain events may also be triggered by the day-night cycle, such as the appearance of rare Pokemon or special battles.</p>

<h2>How Can I Tell What Time It Is in Pokemon Sun?</h2>

<p>In Pokemon Sun, you can check the time of day by taking a look at the clock in the top-right corner of the screen. Additionally, the clock will change color depending on the time of day. When it's daytime, the clock will be yellow, and when it's nighttime, the clock will be blue.</p>

<h2>How Can I Change the Time of Day in Pokemon Sun?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, you cannot change the time of day in Pokemon Sun. The day-night cycle is set to a specific pattern, and will follow the same schedule no matter what. However, if you need to catch a particular Pokemon or trigger a certain event, you can use the in-game Pokemon Center's clock to temporarily change the time of day.</p>
