Umbrellas are incredibly useful items to have on hand, especially in rainy climates. Keeping one around can save you from getting drenched on a particularly wet day. However, if you’re not familiar with how to properly close an umbrella, it can be a bit of a challenge. In this article, we’ll cover the steps you need to take to close any umbrella — both manually and automatically.

<h2>How to Close a Manual Umbrella</h2>

Manual umbrellas are the most common type of umbrella. They require you to open and close them by hand. Here are the steps you need to take to properly close a manual umbrella:

<h3>Step 1: Hold the Handle</h3>

First, take the handle of the umbrella in one hand. If you’re using a smaller umbrella, you can hold it with just one hand. For larger umbrellas, you may need to use both hands.

<h3>Step 2: Push the Slider Down</h3>

Once you have a firm grip on the handle, you’ll need to push the slider down. This is the metal bar that runs along the length of the umbrella. It’s usually located near the top of the handle. Push it down until it clicks into place.

<h3>Step 3: Close the Umbrella</h3>

Once you’ve pushed the slider down, you should be able to easily close the umbrella. Gently push the spokes of the umbrella inwards until they’re all folded up. Make sure that the spokes stay in place, otherwise the umbrella won’t close properly.

<h3>Step 4: Secure the Closure</h3>

Once the umbrella is closed, you’ll need to secure the closure. This is usually done by looping the strap around the handle. Make sure the strap is tight enough that it won’t come undone.

<h2>How to Close an Automatic Umbrella</h2>

Automatic umbrellas are becoming increasingly popular, as they’re much easier to open and close. Here’s how to close an automatic umbrella:

<h3>Step 1: Hold the Handle</h3>

Hold the handle of the umbrella in one hand. If you’re using a smaller umbrella, you can hold it with just one hand. For larger umbrellas, you may need to use both hands.

<h3>Step 2: Push the Button</h3>

Once you have a firm grip on the handle, you’ll need to push the button. This is usually located near the top of the handle. Push the button until you hear a click, which indicates that the umbrella is closed.

<h3>Step 3: Secure the Closure</h3>

Once the umbrella is closed, you’ll need to secure the closure. This is usually done by looping the strap around the handle. Make sure the strap is tight enough that it won’t come undone.

<h2>Tips for Closing an Umbrella</h2>

Closing an umbrella isn’t difficult, but there are a few tips you should keep in mind to make sure you’re doing it correctly:

<h3>Avoid Twisting</h3>

When you’re closing your umbrella, avoid twisting it. This can cause the spokes to become misaligned, which can make it difficult to close properly.

<h3>Secure the Closure</h3>

Make sure you secure the closure after closing the umbrella. This will prevent it from opening accidentally and causing damage.

<h3>Store in a Dry Place</h3>

When you’re not using your umbrella, make sure to store it in a dry place. This will prevent it from rusting or becoming damaged by moisture.
