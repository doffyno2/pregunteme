<p>XCOM 2 is a highly acclaimed turn-based tactical strategy game, in which players take control of an elite international military force to battle aliens who have invaded Earth. One of the most exciting aspects of the game is the ability to climb buildings and use them as vantage points to gain better positions on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Climbing buildings in XCOM 2 is not as simple as it may sound. There are several mechanics involved in order for a soldier to be able to make it to the top. In this article, we will go through the process of how to climb buildings in XCOM 2, step by step.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Positioning</h2>
<p>The first step to climbing a building in XCOM 2 is positioning. You need to make sure your soldier is in a good position to start the climb. This means they need to be close enough to the building so that they can reach the bottom of the structure with their jump. You should also keep in mind the direction in which your soldier is facing, as well as the elevation of the terrain. If the terrain is too steep, the soldier may not be able to make the jump.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Preparing to Climb</h2>
<p>Once your soldier is in position, you will need to prepare them for the climb. You can do this by having them face the building, and then press the “Jump” button. This will cause your soldier to leap forward and grab onto the bottom of the building. This is the only way to begin the climb, so make sure you press the button at the right time.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Climbing the Building</h2>
<p>Once your soldier has a grip on the edge of the building, they can begin the climb. To do this, simply move the mouse cursor over the edge of the building, and click your left mouse button. This will cause your soldier to grab onto the edge and begin to climb. They will keep climbing until they reach the top, or until they are stopped by an enemy or obstacle.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Reaching the Top</h2>
<p>Once your soldier has reached the top, they can then move to the edge of the building and use it as a vantage point. From here, they can fire on enemies below, or survey the battlefield. This can be a great way to gain the upper hand in battle, as it gives you an elevated view of the field.</p>
