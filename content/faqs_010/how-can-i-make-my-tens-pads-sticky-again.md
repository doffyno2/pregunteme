TENS pads, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation pads, are widely used to treat chronic pain, nerve damage, and other medical conditions. The pads attach directly to the skin and provide electrical stimulation to the affected area. Unfortunately, these pads can lose their stickiness over time, making them difficult to use. 

Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to make your tens pads sticky again. With a little bit of effort, you’ll be able to get your pads back to their original level of stickiness.

<h2>What Causes TENS Pads to Lose Their Stickiness?</h2>

TENS pads are usually made of a material that is designed to stick to the skin. Over time, however, the adhesive on the pads can lose its grip and become less effective. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including:

<ul>
<li>Exposure to water, sweat or oils</li>
<li>Frequent use</li>
<li>Exposure to sunlight or extreme temperatures</li>
<li>Fraying or peeling of the adhesive</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Can I Make My TENS Pads Stickier?</h2>

There are a few easy steps you can take to make your TENS pads stickier again. Here’s what you can do:

<h3>1. Clean the Pads</h3>

The first step is to make sure the pads are clean. Use a mild soap and water to gently clean the pads and then let them air-dry. This will remove any residue, oils, or dirt that might be preventing the pads from sticking properly.

<h3>2. Replace the Adhesive</h3>

If the adhesive has frayed or peeled away, it may be time to replace it. You can buy adhesive replacement patches online or at your local drugstore. Simply apply the adhesive patch to the back of the pad and press firmly until it sticks.

<h3>3. Use Adhesive Sprays</h3>

If the pads are still not sticking properly, you can try using an adhesive spray. These sprays are designed to help the pads stick better and can be found at most drugstores. Just make sure to follow the instructions carefully and to avoid spraying the pads directly with the spray.

<h3>4. Use Heat</h3>

Heat can also help make your TENS pads stickier. You can use a hair dryer on the low setting to warm up the pads and make them more pliable. Just make sure not to use too much heat, as this could damage the pads.
