<p>Native American Indian Dogs (NAID) are a breed of domestic dog that originated from the indigenous peoples of the Americas. They are an ancient breed and are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and strong herding instinct. They are also known for their friendly, gentle nature. The breed is not recognized by any major kennel club, but they are becoming increasingly popular as pets and show dogs. If you are considering adding a NAID to your family, you may be wondering how much they cost and what factors determine their price.</p>

<h2>The Cost of a Native American Indian Dog</h2>

<p>The cost of a NAID can vary depending on a variety of factors. Generally, the cost can range anywhere from $500 to $2,500 USD. The price of a NAID will depend on the breeder, the age of the dog, and the quality of the litter.</p>

<p>When looking for a NAID, it's important to choose a reputable breeder. Reputable breeders will usually charge more for their puppies due to their commitment to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies.

<h2>Factors to Consider Before Buying a NAID</h2>
