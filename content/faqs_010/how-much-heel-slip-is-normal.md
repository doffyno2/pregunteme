Other reasons include shoes that are too stiff or too soft, or if the sole of the shoe is not properly fitted to the foot.

<h2>How to Prevent Heel Slip?</h2>

The best way to prevent heel slip is to make sure you are wearing the right size shoe. This means measuring your foot and trying on the different sizes available before you buy. It is also important to choose a shoe that provides the right amount of support and cushioning. If the shoe is too stiff or too soft, it may cause your foot to slide around in the back of the shoe.
