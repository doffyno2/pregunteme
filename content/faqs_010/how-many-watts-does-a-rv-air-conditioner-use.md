Use researched facts and figures.



<p>Are you considering purchasing a RV air conditioner but don’t know how many watts it will use? You’ve come to the right place. In this article, we’ll explain the wattage of RV air conditioners, how to calculate the wattage of your RV air conditioner, and how to reduce your RV air conditioner’s wattage consumption. </p>

<h2>What is the Wattage of an RV Air Conditioner?</h2>

<p>Most RV air conditioners range between 1,200 and 15,000 watts. The wattage of your RV air conditioner will depend on the size and type of your RV, as well as the model of the air conditioner you purchase. For example, a 13,500 BTU RV air conditioner typically requires 1,200 watts, while a 15,000 BTU RV air conditioner typically requires 1,500 watts. </p>

<h2>How to Calculate Wattage of Your RV Air Conditioner</h2>

<p>To calculate the wattage of your RV air conditioner, you need to know the voltage and amperage of the unit. Voltage is measured in volts (V) and amperage is measured in amperes (A). Once you know the voltage and amperage of the unit, you can calculate the wattage by multiplying the voltage by the amperage. For example, if your RV air conditioner has a voltage of 120V and an amperage of 10A, the wattage of the unit is 1,200 watts. </p>

<h2>How to Reduce Wattage Consumption</h2>

<p>RV air conditioners are one of the largest consumers of electricity in an RV. To reduce your RV air conditioner’s wattage consumption, you should use a programmable thermostat to set the temperature and turn it down when you’re away or asleep. You can also use a fan to help circulate air and reduce the wattage required to cool your RV. </p>
