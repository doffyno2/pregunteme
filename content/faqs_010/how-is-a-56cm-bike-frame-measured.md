In this article, we’ll take a look at how bike frames are measured and how to determine the correct frame size for your bike.</p>

<h2>What Is a Bike Frame?</h2>

<p>A bike frame is the main component of your bike. It is the metal frame that holds all the other bike components, including the handlebars, wheels, pedals, and seat.

<h2>How Is a Bike Frame Measured?</h2>

<p>Bike frames are typically measured in centimeters (cm). The most important measurement is the top tube length, which is measured from the center of the head tube to the center of the seat tube. The frame size is then determined by the top tube length. Generally, taller riders need a larger frame size and shorter riders need a smaller frame size.</p>

<h2>What Is the Standard Size for a Bike Frame?</h2>
