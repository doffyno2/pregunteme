I want you to write in the style of the article I gave you.



<p>The Shimano Deore XT rear derailleur is one of the most commonly used components of mountain bike drivetrains. It is an important part of the overall shifting system that helps to transfer power from the pedals to the rear wheel. As such, it is important to understand how to adjust and maintain the derailleur so that it works correctly and efficiently. In this article, we will provide an overview of how to adjust a Shimano Deore XT rear derailleur.</p>

<h2>Tools Needed to Adjust Shimano Deore XT Rear Derailleur</h2>

<p>Before attempting to adjust the Shimano Deore XT rear derailleur, it is important to make sure you have the correct tools. The tools needed for the job include an adjustable wrench, a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, and a cable cutter. It is also important to make sure you have a good lubricant, such as WD-40.</p>

<h2>Steps to Adjust Shimano Deore XT Rear Derailleur</h2>

<p>The first step to adjusting a Shimano Deore XT rear derailleur is to identify the high and low gears on the derailleur. The high gear is located on the left side of the derailleur and the low gear is located on the right. Once you have identified the gears, you can move on to the next step.</p>

<p>The second step is to adjust the limit screws. The limit screws are located on the derailleur housing and are used to limit the travel of the derailleur cage. To adjust the limit screws, loosen them until the chain is no longer able to travel beyond the high and low gears. Once the limit screws are set, you can move on to the next step.</p>

<p>The third step is to adjust the cable tension. This can be done by loosening the cable anchor bolt and then tightening the cable until there is no slack in the cable. Once the cable tension is set, you can move on to the next step.</p>

<p>The fourth step is to adjust the barrel adjuster. The barrel adjuster is located on the derailleur housing and is used to fine-tune the shifting action of the derailleur. To adjust the barrel adjuster, turn it clockwise until the shifting action is smooth and precise.</p>

<p>The fifth and final step is to adjust the B-tension screw. The B-tension screw is located on the derailleur body and is used to set the distance between the upper pulley wheel and the cassette. To adjust the B-tension screw, turn it clockwise until the pulley wheel is positioned correctly.</p>
