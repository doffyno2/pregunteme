<p>Capstar for Dogs is a flea and tick control medication that is used to eliminate existing fleas, ticks, and lice on dogs and puppies. It is a fast-acting pill that begins killing fleas within just 30 minutes of administration. But how long does this pill last?</p>

<p>Capstar is an orally administered, small pill that contains nitenpyram as its active ingredient. This chemical quickly begins to take effect after being ingested by your pet, as it enters their bloodstream and is distributed throughout the body. It is most effective in killing adult fleas, and it begins to work within just 30 minutes. It is usually effective for 24 hours, but it can last up to 48 hours in some cases.</p>

<h2>How Does Capstar Work?</h2>

<p>Capstar is an insecticide that works by blocking nerve signals in fleas and other insects. This causes paralysis of the fleas, which leads to their death. It works quickly and is very effective in killing adult fleas. It does not repel fleas, so it will not prevent new fleas from infesting your pet. However, it can be used in conjunction with other flea control products to provide long-term protection from fleas.</p>

<h2>Is Capstar Safe for Dogs?</h2>

<p>Capstar is a safe and effective flea control medication for dogs. It is FDA approved and has been thoroughly tested for safety.

It is important to follow the directions on the package when administering Capstar to your pet.</p>

<h2>What Are the Side Effects of Capstar?</h2>

<p>Capstar is generally well tolerated by dogs, but some side effects may occur. These include vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, and loss of appetite. If your pet experiences any of these side effects, contact your veterinarian immediately. It is also important to note that Capstar does not provide any protection from other parasites such as worms, so if you think your pet may have worms, contact your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<h2>How Often Should I Give My Dog Capstar?</h2>

<p>Capstar is a fast-acting medication and it begins to kill fleas within 30 minutes after administration. However, it is not a long-term flea control solution.
