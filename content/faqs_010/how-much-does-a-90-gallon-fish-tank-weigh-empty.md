<h3>Glass Tanks</h3>

<p>Glass tanks are the most popular choice for many fish hobbyists. They are typically the most affordable option and are also fairly easy to maintain.

The weight of an acrylic 90 gallon tank can range from around 80 to 120 pounds when empty.</p>

<h2>Estimated Weight of a 90 Gallon Fish Tank</h2>
