<p>The Lewis and Clark Expedition, also known as the Corps of Discovery, was the first American overland expedition to the Pacific Coast and back. It was led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson in 1803. This amazing journey began in May 1804 and lasted two and a half years, covering more than 8,000 miles of lands. The Expedition played a major role in America’s westward expansion, and its findings provided valuable information about the newly acquired Louisiana Territory.</p>

<p>The Lewis and Clark Expedition was a massive undertaking. Even though the journey was divided into three phases, it was continuous in that the Corps of Discovery never returned to their starting point. Their objective was to explore and document the uncharted western lands. The expedition was divided into three distinct sections. The first section was the outbound journey from their starting point in St. Louis, Missouri, to their destination in the Pacific Northwest. The second section was the return journey back to St. Louis, and the third section was the exploration of the newly acquired Louisiana Territory.</p>

<p>The total distance of the Lewis and Clark Expedition was 8,000 miles. This began in St. Louis, Missouri, and ended in the Pacific Northwest. They began their journey on May 14, 1804 and completed their journey on September 23, 1806. Along the way, they stopped at numerous locations including present day Kansas City, Missouri; Fort Mandan, North Dakota; the Three Forks area; and the Pacific Coast. They also documented the culture and geography of the lands they encountered along the way.</p>
