<p>Dogs are often prescribed Capstar and Nexguard to treat flea infestations, but can they take both medications at the same time? The short answer is yes, your dog can take both Capstar and Nexguard at the same time, but there are a few important considerations to keep in mind before giving your pet both of these medications. </p>

<h2>What is Capstar?</h2>

<p>Capstar is a flea treatment medication that is typically given to dogs. It is an oral medication that contains the active ingredient nitenpyram, which is an insecticide.

Capstar is only effective on adult fleas and does not prevent flea infestations from occurring. </p>
