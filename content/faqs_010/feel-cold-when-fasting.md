Fasting is a popular way of managing health and weight. It is gaining more and more attention from the health-conscious. Some people, however, experience feeling cold while fasting, which can make the process uncomfortable. In this article, we will discuss why this happens and what you can do about it.

<h2>What Is Fasting?</h2>

Fasting is a form of intermittent fasting. It involves abstaining from food and drinks for varying lengths of time. There are various types of fasting, including intermittent fasting, alternate-day fasting, and time-restricted feeding. The most common type of fasting is intermittent fasting, which involves eating during a specific window of time each day. 

The idea behind fasting is that by eating less food and reducing your calorie intake, you can lose weight and improve your health. Studies have found that fasting can help reduce inflammation, improve blood sugar levels, and lead to weight loss.

<h2>Why Do Some People Feel Cold When Fasting?</h2>

When you fast, your body needs to adjust to burning fewer calories. This can cause your body to burn its own fat stores for energy. As your body breaks down fat, it releases ketones into the bloodstream. Ketones are a type of fuel that your body uses for energy, but they also have a cooling effect on the body. This can lead to feeling cold while fasting.

In addition, when you don’t eat for a long period of time, your body’s metabolism slows down. This can lead to a decrease in body temperature. If you’re not taking in enough calories through food, your body will try to conserve energy, which can also make you feel cold.

<h2>What Can You Do to Stay Warm?</h2>

There are several things you can do to stay warm while fasting. First, make sure you’re drinking enough fluids. Dehydration can cause your body to cool down, so it’s important to stay hydrated.

Second, dress in layers. Wearing multiple layers of clothing will help to keep you warm. Choose breathable fabrics that will allow your body to regulate its temperature.

Third, add extra fiber to your diet. Eating fiber-rich foods will help to keep your body warm. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are all good sources of fiber. 

Finally, get plenty of sleep. Getting enough rest will help to keep your body warm and regulate your metabolism.

<h2>Are There Any Risks to Feeling Cold When Fasting?</h2>

Feeling cold while fasting is usually not a cause for concern. However, if you start to feel overly cold or experience other symptoms, such as dizziness or nausea, it’s important to stop fasting and seek medical attention.
