<p>For pregnant women, it is important to make sure that your diet is healthy and safe for both you and your unborn baby. Seafood can be a great source of protein and other essential vitamins and minerals, but it is important to be aware of the risks associated with consuming certain types of seafood. Mahi mahi, or dolphinfish, is one type of seafood that has been questioned as to its safety for pregnant women. While there are some risks associated with consuming mahi mahi during pregnancy, there are also some potential benefits if it is consumed in moderation.

It is important to note that this recommendation is for both canned and fresh mahi mahi. If you plan to eat more than this, it is important to consult with your healthcare provider for specific recommendations.</p>

<h2>Other Considerations When Eating Mahi Mahi When Pregnant</h2>

<p>In addition to limiting your consumption of mahi mahi, there are other considerations to keep in mind when eating it while pregnant. It is important to be aware of the potential for contamination with parasites or bacteria. Be sure to cook the mahi mahi thoroughly and to purchase it from a reliable source. It is also important to avoid eating raw mahi mahi. Additionally, be sure to limit your consumption of other types of seafood, as some types of fish may contain higher levels of mercury.</p>
