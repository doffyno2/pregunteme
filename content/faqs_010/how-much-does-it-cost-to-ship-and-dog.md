When it comes to transporting your pet, you want to make sure it’s done safely and securely. Shipping a dog may be the best way to get your pet to its destination, but it’s important to know how much it will cost before committing to the service. In this article, we’ll go over the factors that affect the cost of shipping a dog and provide an estimate of what you can expect to pay.

<h2>Factors That Affect the Cost of Shipping a Dog</h2>

There are several factors that go into determining the cost of shipping a dog. The size of your pet and the distance it needs to travel are two of the most important factors. Here’s a closer look at each one:

<h3>Size of the Pet</h3>

The size of the pet is one of the most important factors in determining the cost of shipping a dog. Smaller dogs may be able to be shipped in a crate that fits in the cargo area of a commercial airliner or in a smaller container that is designed for domestic pet shipping. Larger dogs may need to be transported in a larger crate that fits in the cargo area of an international flight. The cost of shipping a dog can vary significantly depending on the size of the pet and the size of the crate needed.

<h3>Distance to be Traveled</h3>

The distance to be traveled is another factor that affects the cost of shipping a dog. If your pet needs to be transported across the country, the cost will likely be higher than if it’s just being moved across town. Additionally, the cost of international transportation may be more expensive than domestic shipping, depending on the destination. 

<h2>Estimated Cost of Shipping a Dog</h2>

The cost of shipping a dog can vary significantly depending on the size of the pet and the distance it needs to be transported. For domestic shipping, the cost can range from $100 to $400 or more. For international shipping, the cost can range from $500 to $1,500 or more.
