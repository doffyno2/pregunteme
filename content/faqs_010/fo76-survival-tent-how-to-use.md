<p>Fallout 76 is an online prequel to the Fallout series of games, developed by Bethesda Game Studios. The game is set in an apocalyptic world, where players are able to build and maintain their own shelters, called Survival Tents, to protect themselves from the harsh environment. In this article, we will discuss how to use a Survival Tent in Fallout 76. </p>

<h2>What Is a Survival Tent?</h2>

<p>A Survival Tent is a shelter in Fallout 76 that players are able to build and maintain. It is a useful structure that provides a safe place to sleep, store items, and protect the player from environmental hazards and hostile creatures. This shelter can be constructed using various materials, including wood, stone, and steel. The tent also provides protection from radiation, extreme weather conditions, and other dangers.</p>

<h2>How to Build a Survival Tent</h2>

<p>The first step in building a Survival Tent is to collect the necessary materials. Players will need wood, stone, and steel to construct the structure. Once the materials are gathered, players can begin building the shelter. To begin, players will need to craft a Tent Frame. This frame is made from wood, stone, and steel and is the foundation of the shelter. </p>

<p>Once the Tent Frame is constructed, players will need to craft a Survival Tent Canopy. This Canopy is made from cloth and is used to protect the player from the elements. Once the Canopy is in place, players will need to craft a Survival Tent Floor. This floor is made from wood, stone, and steel and provides a sturdy base for the shelter. </p>

<p>Finally, players will need to craft a Survival Tent Wall. This wall is made from wood, stone, and steel and provides additional protection from the elements. Once the wall is in place, players can begin to decorate the shelter with various items and furniture. </p>

<h2>How to Maintain a Survival Tent</h2>

<p>Maintaining a Survival Tent is important in order to ensure its longevity. Players will need to periodically inspect the structure for any damage or decay. It is also important to clean the shelter regularly to ensure that it remains free of dirt, dust, and other debris. Additionally, players will need to repair any damages or decay that is found. </p>

<p>Players can also upgrade their Survival Tent by adding additional items, such as a bed, a cooking station, or a workbench. These items can be crafted using materials that can be found in the world. Additionally, players can craft items to improve the shelter’s defenses, such as traps and turrets. </p>

<h2>How to Use a Survival Tent</h2>

<p>Once the Survival Tent is built and maintained properly, it can be used as a safe place to rest, store items, and protect the player from the environment. Players can sleep in the shelter to restore their health and gain access to their Stash Box, which can be used to store items. Additionally, players can craft items and repair weapons in the shelter. </p>
