<p>In the United States, there is no single answer to the question of how many bars are in the country. Depending on the definition used, the range of possible answers can be quite broad.

<p>The National Restaurant Association (NRA) estimates that there are over 675,000 restaurants and bars in the United States. This number includes both full-service and limited-service restaurants, as well as bars and taverns. The NRA also estimates that there are over 1.2 million alcohol-serving locations in the US.
