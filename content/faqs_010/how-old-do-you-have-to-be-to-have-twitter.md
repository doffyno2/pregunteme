<p>Twitter is one of the world’s most popular social media platforms, with over 330 million active monthly users. It has become an important part of how people communicate and share information. But is there an age restriction on who can use Twitter?</p>

<p>The answer is yes – in order to open a Twitter account, you must be at least 13 years old. This is due to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which sets out rules and regulations regarding data privacy and the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. </p>

<p>Twitter also has a strict policy on the age of its users, and the company reserves the right to close down accounts that it believes are being used by people under the age of 13. If you are found to be under the age of 13, your account will be suspended immediately and you will be asked to delete it.</p>
