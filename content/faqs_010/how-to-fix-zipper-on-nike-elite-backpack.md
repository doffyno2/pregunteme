<p>Having a zipper break on your Nike Elite backpack can be a major inconvenience. After all, you rely on this bag to carry your items and keep them safe. Fortunately, it’s usually a relatively simple fix that can be done in a few minutes. All you need is a pair of pliers and some patience. Read on to learn how to fix the zipper on your Nike Elite backpack.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Locate the Zipper Tab</h2>

<p>The first step is to locate the zipper tab. This is the small piece of metal that connects the two sides of the zipper together. It’s usually located at the end of the zipper, but it can also be found in the middle. If you can’t find it, look closely and you should be able to spot it.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Open the Zipper Tab</h2>

<p>Once you’ve located the zipper tab, use your pliers to gently open it. Be sure to open it slowly and carefully so as not to damage the zipper or the tab itself. Once you’ve opened the tab, you should be able to see the teeth of the zipper. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Straighten the Teeth</h2>

<p>The next step is to straighten the teeth of the zipper. Use your pliers to carefully straighten any bent or misaligned teeth. Be sure to work slowly and carefully so as not to damage the teeth. Once you’ve straightened all of the teeth, the zipper should be able to move freely again.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Close the Zipper Tab</h2>

<p>Once you’ve straightened the teeth, close the zipper tab. Use your pliers to gently close the tab, being careful not to damage the zipper or the tab itself. Once you’ve closed the tab, the zipper should be able to move freely again. </p>

<h2>Step 5: Test the Zipper</h2>

<p>Once you’ve closed the tab, test the zipper to make sure it’s working properly. Open and close the zipper a few times to make sure it’s moving freely. If it’s still not working properly, repeat steps 2-4 until it’s working correctly.</p>
