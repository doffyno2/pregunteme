<h2>Introduction</h2>

Bug spray can be a lifesaver when it comes to keeping pesky insects away, but it can also have an unwanted effect on plastic surfaces. Plastic is a porous material, which means it absorbs liquids easily. This can cause the bug spray to seep into the plastic and leave behind a nasty residue. Luckily, there are a few simple tricks you can use to clean bug spray off of plastic surfaces. 

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Area</h2>

Before starting the cleaning process, it’s important to properly prepare the area. Begin by wiping down the plastic surface with a damp cloth or paper towel to remove any excess bug spray. Be sure to use a gentle cleaning solution, such as mild soap and water, to avoid damaging the plastic.

<h2>Step 2: Create a Cleaning Solution</h2>

Once the area has been prepared, it’s time to create a cleaning solution. Mix together one part white vinegar with one part hot water in a bowl or bucket. This solution is ideal for removing stubborn bug spray residue from plastic surfaces.
 
<h2>Step 3: Apply the Solution</h2>

Once the cleaning solution is ready, it’s time to apply it to the plastic surface. Using a clean cloth or sponge, apply the solution to the plastic in a circular motion. Be sure to cover the entire surface, as this will help ensure all of the bug spray residue is removed.

<h2>Step 4: Let It Sit</h2>

Once the solution has been applied to the plastic, let it sit for 10-15 minutes. This will give the solution time to work its magic and break down the bug spray residue.

<h2>Step 5: Rinse & Dry</h2>

After 10-15 minutes, it’s time to rinse off the solution. Use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe away the solution and any remaining residue. Once the area has been thoroughly rinsed, dry it with a clean cloth or paper towel.
