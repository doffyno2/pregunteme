<p>Subnautica is a game that takes players to an underwater world where they have to explore and survive against the odds. It’s a game full of mysteries, challenges and adventure, and one of its biggest challenges is the radiation. Throughout the game, players will come across areas where radiation levels are high and need to be repaired in order to progress. But how do you repair the radiation in Subnautica?</p>

<h2>Understanding Radiation in Subnautica</h2>

<p>Radiation in Subnautica can be found in many different areas of the game, such as the Aurora, Degasi Seabases, and the Quarantine Enforcement Platform. The radiation in these areas can be dangerous, and it can cause damage to the player’s health and radiation over time. It’s important to understand the radiation in Subnautica before trying to repair it.</p>

<p>Radiation in Subnautica is measured in two different ways: Radiation Level and Radiation Resistance. Radiation Level is the amount of radiation present in the area, and it increases as the player explores more and more of the game. Radiation Resistance is the player’s ability to resist radiation, and it decreases as the player takes damage from radiation. In order to repair the radiation, the player must find a way to increase their Radiation Resistance while decreasing the Radiation Level in the affected areas.</p>

<h2>Repairing Radiation in Subnautica</h2>

<p>The first step to repairing radiation in Subnautica is to make sure the player’s Radiation Resistance is as high as possible. This can be done by collecting Radiation Suits, which can be found in various places in the game. These suits provide a temporary boost to Radiation Resistance, which can help the player take less damage from radiation while they repair the affected areas.</p>

<p>The second step to repairing radiation in Subnautica is to reduce the Radiation Level in the affected areas. This can be done by collecting Radiation Cores, which can be found scattered throughout the game. These cores can be used to reduce the Radiation Level in an area, allowing the player to explore more safely. It’s important to note that Radiation Cores can only be used once, so it’s important to use them wisely.</p>

<p>The third step to repairing radiation in Subnautica is to make sure the Radiation Level is within a safe range. This can be done by collecting Radiation Filters, which can be found in various places in the game. These filters can be used to reduce the Radiation Level in an area, allowing the player to explore more safely.</p>

<h2>Dangers of Radiation in Subnautica</h2>

<p>While repairing radiation in Subnautica can be beneficial, it’s important to note that radiation itself can be dangerous. Radiation can cause damage to the player’s health and radiation over time, so it’s important to be careful when exploring areas with high Radiation Levels.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that Radiation Cores can be dangerous if used improperly. If a Radiation Core is used in an area with a high Radiation Level, it can cause a dangerous spike in Radiation Level, which can cause significant damage to the player’s health and radiation. It’s important to use Radiation Cores wisely and only in areas where the Radiation Level is already low.</p>

<h2>Tips for Repairing Radiation in Subnautica</h2>

<p>When repairing radiation in Subnautica, there are a few tips that can help make the process easier. The first is to make sure the player’s Radiation Resistance is as high as possible. This can be done by collecting Radiation Suits, which can be found in various places in the game.</p>

<p>The second tip is to make sure the Radiation Level is within a safe range. This can be done by collecting Radiation Filters, which can be found in various places in the game. These filters can be used to reduce the Radiation Level in an area, allowing the player to explore more safely.</p>

<p>The third tip is to use Radiation Cores wisely. If a Radiation Core is used in an area with a high Radiation Level, it can cause a dangerous spike in Radiation Level, which can cause significant damage to the player’s health and radiation. It’s important to use Radiation Cores wisely and only in areas where the Radiation Level is already low.</p>
