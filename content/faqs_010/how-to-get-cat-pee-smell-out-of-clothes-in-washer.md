<p>Cat urine has a strong, pungent odor that can linger in clothes and make them smell bad. If you’ve discovered that your cat has been using your laundry as a litter box, you may be wondering how to get cat urine smell out of clothes in the washer. Fortunately, there are several simple steps you can take to eliminate the smell of cat urine from your laundry. </p>

<h2>Removing Cat Urine Smell from Clothes in the Washer</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Treat the Stain</h3>

<p>Before you attempt to remove the smell of cat urine from your clothes, it’s important to first treat the stain. Start by blotting up as much of the urine as possible with a paper towel. Then, rinse the area with cold water. If the stain remains, use a laundry pre-treatment spray or stain remover to help lift out the stain. </p>

<h3>Step 2: Use an Enzyme-Based Cleaner</h3>

<p>Once you’ve treated the stain, it’s time to wash the clothes. To get rid of the smell of cat urine, you’ll need to use an enzyme-based cleaner. These cleaners are specially formulated to break down the proteins and odors found in pet urine. Be sure to follow the instructions on your cleaner and use the recommended amount for the size of your load. </p>

<h3>Step 3: Add Vinegar to the Wash Cycle</h3>

<p>In addition to an enzyme-based cleaner, it’s also a good idea to add some vinegar to the wash cycle. Vinegar is a natural odor neutralizer and will help to eliminate any lingering smell of cat urine. Just make sure not to use too much or it can damage your clothes. </p>

<h3>Step 4: Use Hot Water and Extra Rinse Cycles</h3>

<p>Once you’ve added the enzyme-based cleaner and vinegar, it’s time to start the washer. To ensure that the cat urine smell is eliminated, use the hottest water temperature your clothes can handle and set the machine to an extra rinse cycle. This will help to ensure that all the detergent and odors are completely rinsed away. </p>

<h3>Step 5: Dry the Clothes Immediately</h3>

<p>Once the wash cycle is complete, it’s important to dry the clothes immediately. The longer the clothes stay wet, the more time the cat urine smell has to set in and become permanent. To ensure that the smell is completely eliminated, put the clothes in the dryer on the highest heat setting for at least 30 minutes. </p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Q: How can I prevent my cat from urinating on my clothes?</h3>

<p>A: The best way to prevent your cat from urinating on your clothes is to make sure they have access to a clean litter box.

<h3>Q: How do I know if the cat urine smell is gone?</h3>

<p>A: Once you’ve followed the steps outlined above, you can test for the presence of the cat urine smell by taking a whiff of the clothes after they’ve been washed and dried. If the smell is still present, it may be necessary to repeat the washing and drying process.</p>

<h3>Q: Is there any way to remove cat urine smell from clothes without washing them?</h3>

<p>A: Unfortunately, washing the clothes is the only surefire way to get rid of the cat urine smell. However, you may be able to reduce the odor by sprinkling baking soda on the stained areas and allowing it to sit for several hours before vacuuming it up.</p>
