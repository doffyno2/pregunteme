<p>Onions may be a safe and tasty snack for humans, but they are not the same for our canine companions. While a small serving of onions may not kill a dog, too much can be fatal. Onions contain compounds that are toxic to dogs and cats, and can even cause anemia. For this reason, it is important to keep onions out of your pet’s reach and to be aware of the dangers of onions for dogs.</p>

<h2>What Makes Onions Toxic to Dogs?</h2>

<p>Onions contain a compound called thiosulphate which is toxic to dogs and cats. This compound is found in both raw and cooked onions, although the risk is slightly lower with cooked onions. When a dog consumes too much thiosulphate, it can cause the red blood cells in the dog’s body to break down, leading to anemia. This can be fatal if left untreated.</p>

<p>The toxicity of onions is dose-dependent, which means that the more a dog consumes, the more dangerous it is. As a general rule, it is best to avoid feeding your dog any onions. It is also important to make sure that your dog does not have access to any onion dishes that may have been left out.</p>

<h2>What Are the Signs of Onion Toxicity in Dogs?</h2>

<p>The most common sign of onion toxicity in dogs is anemia. This can be detected through a blood test, which will show a decrease in the number of red blood cells. Other signs of onion toxicity include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, increased thirst and appetite, and weight loss.</p>
