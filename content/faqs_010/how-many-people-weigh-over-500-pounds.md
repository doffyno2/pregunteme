The obesity epidemic is one of the most pressing public health issues in the United States. In 2020, an estimated 42.4% of adults were considered to be obese and a further 4.4% were considered to be severely obese. It is estimated that about 5.7% of adults in the United States weigh over 500 pounds.

<h2>What is the Obesity Epidemic?</h2>

The obesity epidemic refers to the rapid increase in the number of people in the United States who are considered to be obese or overweight. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater. BMI is calculated using an individual's weight and height. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines obesity as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.

The obesity epidemic in the United States has been fueled by a number of factors, including the availability of high-calorie, energy-dense foods and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that certain genetic and environmental factors may play a role in the development of obesity.

<h2>How Many People Weigh Over 500 Pounds?</h2>

It is estimated that about 5.7% of adults in the United States weigh over 500 pounds. This figure is based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is the most comprehensive survey of its kind in the United States. The survey is conducted every two years by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

The NHANES survey found that about 4.4% of adults aged 20 and over in the United States were considered to be severely obese, with a BMI of 40 or greater. Of those individuals, it is estimated that about 5.7% weighed over 500 pounds.

<h2>What Health Risks are Associated with Being Severely Obese?</h2>

Being severely obese carries with it a number of serious health risks, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. People who are severely obese are also at an increased risk of developing sleep apnea, joint pain, and other musculoskeletal disorders. In addition, severe obesity can lead to psychological issues such as depression and anxiety.

<h2>How is Severe Obesity Treated?</h2>

The treatment of severe obesity typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes, such as changing one's diet and increasing physical activity, as well as medications and surgical procedures. In some cases, medications such as orlistat and liraglutide can be used to help people lose weight. In more severe cases, surgical procedures such as gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy may be recommended.

<h2>What is the Long-Term Outlook for People Who are Severely Obese?</h2>

The long-term outlook for people who are severely obese is largely dependent on the individual's willingness to make lifestyle changes and follow their doctor's recommendations. People who are severely obese can significantly improve their health and quality of life if they are able to make permanent lifestyle changes and adhere to their treatment plan.
