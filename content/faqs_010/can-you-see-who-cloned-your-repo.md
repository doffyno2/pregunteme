<p>GitHub is a popular online platform for web developers, and it’s become an integral part of many web development processes. It allows users to share code and collaborate on projects, but it also provides a way for users to keep track of who has access to their code. One of the most common questions asked by users is: can you see who cloned your repo?</p>

<p>The short answer is that, yes, you can see who has cloned a repository on GitHub. However, there are a few caveats to this answer. For example, if the repository is private, there may be no way to track who has cloned it. Additionally, there are some technical steps that must be taken in order to view a list of people who have cloned a repository. In this article, we’ll discuss the ways you can check who has cloned your repo, and how to ensure your repository is secure.</p>

<h2>What is a Repository?</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the details of how to see who has cloned your repo, it’s important to understand what a repository is. A repository is essentially a collection of files and folders that are used to store source code. Each repository is stored in a single location, and it can be used to store any type of file. It can also be accessed by multiple users, allowing them to share and collaborate on projects.</p>

<h2>How to Check Who Has Cloned Your Repo</h2>

<p>If you’re wondering if someone has cloned your repository, the first step is to check the “activity” tab on your repository page. This tab will show you all the recent activity on your repository, including who has cloned it. However, if the repository is private, you won’t be able to see a list of people who have cloned it. Additionally, the “activity” tab may not show all the activity on your repository, so it’s important to keep track of who has access to it.</p>

<p>Another way to check who has cloned your repo is to use the “GitHub API”. The GitHub API allows developers to access data from GitHub repositories, including who has cloned a repository. To use the GitHub API, you’ll need to create an access token. The access token will be used to authenticate your requests to the GitHub API. Once you have the access token, you can use the GitHub API to retrieve a list of people who have cloned your repository.</p>

<h2>Are My Repositories Secure?</h2>

<p>If you’re worried about someone cloning your repository without your permission, there are a few steps you can take to ensure that your repositories are secure. The first step is to set up a strong password for your repository. Additionally, you should consider setting up two-factor authentication for your repository, which will require a second authentication step before anyone can access your repository.</p>

<p>It’s also important to keep track of who has access to your repository. You can do this by monitoring the “activity” tab on your repository page, or by using the GitHub API. Additionally, you should consider setting up a “commit” policy, which will require all contributors to sign off on any changes they make to the repository.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To answer the question “can you see who cloned your repo?”, the answer is yes. However, there are a few precautions you should take to ensure that your repositories are secure. You should set up a strong password for your repository, monitor who has access to it, and consider setting up a “commit” policy. Additionally, you can use the GitHub API to retrieve a list of people who have cloned your repository.</p>
