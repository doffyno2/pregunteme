How Many Calories is 1 Gram of Protein?

Protein is an essential macronutrient that is necessary for the human body to function properly. It helps to build and repair cells, maintain healthy bones and muscles, and produce hormones and enzymes. Proteins are made up of different amino acids, and the amount of energy or calories that a gram of protein contains varies depending on the type of protein you are consuming. Therefore, it’s important to understand how many calories are in a single gram of protein so you can make sure you’re getting enough of this macronutrient in your diet.



Protein is a macronutrient that is made of various amino acids. These amino acids bond together to form a polypeptide chain, which is then folded into a 3-dimensional structure. The structure of the protein determines what it is and how it functions in the body. There are 20 different types of amino acids, nine of which are considered essential, meaning that they must be consumed through food or supplements. 

Proteins are important for many bodily functions, including building and repairing cells, helping to regulate hormones and enzymes, and providing energy during times of stress or exercise. They also play an important role in muscle growth and development, so it is essential to make sure you get enough protein in your diet.



The amount of calories in a single gram of protein depends on the type of protein you are consuming. Animal proteins, such as beef, chicken, fish, and eggs, contain about four calories per gram. Plant proteins, including legumes, nuts, and grains, contain about two to three calories per gram. 

For example, if you eat one ounce (28 grams) of cooked lean beef, you will consume about 112 calories. This is the equivalent of 28 grams of protein, which would contain four calories per gram. On the other hand, if you eat one ounce (28 grams) of cooked pinto beans, you would consume about 56 calories. This is the equivalent of 28 grams of protein, which would contain two calories per gram.



Getting enough protein in your diet is essential for good health. Eating enough protein can help to build and repair cells, maintain healthy bones and muscles, and provide energy during times of stress or exercise. It can also help you to feel fuller for longer, which can help to reduce your overall calorie intake and aid in weight loss. Eating a variety of different types of proteins can also help to ensure you get all the essential amino acids your body needs. 



The amount of protein you need to eat per day depends on your age, gender, and level of physical activity. Generally, the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day for adults. For example, a person who weighs 70 kilograms (154 pounds) should aim to eat 56 grams of protein each day. 

It is important to note that the DRI is just a general guideline and that other factors, such as health conditions, may require you to consume more or less protein. It is best to speak to your doctor or a dietitian to determine what is best for you. 



Protein can be found in a variety of foods, including both animal and plant sources. Animal proteins include beef, chicken, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Plant proteins include legumes, nuts, grains, and soy products. 

It is important to eat a variety of different sources of protein to ensure you get all the essential amino acids your body needs. It is also important to remember that some animal proteins, such as red meat and full-fat dairy products, are higher in saturated fat, which can increase your risk of heart disease if consumed in excess.
