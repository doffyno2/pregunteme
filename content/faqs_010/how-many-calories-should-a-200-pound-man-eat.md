Calorie counting is an important part of any weight loss program. Knowing how many calories a person should eat in order to maintain or lose weight is essential. But how many calories should a 200 pound man eat?

<h2>What are Calories?</h2>

Calories are units of energy found in food. They provide the energy needed to fuel your body. When you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight. When you eat fewer calories than you burn, you lose weight.

<h2>What is a Calorie Deficit?</h2>

A calorie deficit is when you eat fewer calories than you burn. This is the key to losing weight. When you create a calorie deficit, your body is forced to use stored fat for energy.

<h2>How Many Calories Should a 200 Pound Man Eat?</h2>
