Climbing stairs is an excellent way to stay fit and healthy. But how many floors should you climb a day to reap the most benefits? That depends on several factors, including your overall fitness level, the type of stairs you’re climbing, and the intensity of your stair climbing workout.

If you’re just starting out, it’s best to start with a lower number of floors and gradually increase as your fitness level improves. 

<h2>Tips For Safe Stair Climbing</h2>
