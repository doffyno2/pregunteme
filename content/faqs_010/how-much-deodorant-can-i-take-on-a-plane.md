Traveling by plane can be a stressful experience, especially when you are concerned about the items you can and cannot take on board. One such item that can cause confusion is deodorant. If you are planning a long flight, you may be wondering "how much deodorant can I take on a plane?"

<h2>How Much Deodorant Can I Take On a Plane?</h2>

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allows travelers to bring deodorant on board in both aerosol and non-aerosol forms. However, the amount of deodorant you can take on a plane depends on the size of the containers. According to the TSA, aerosol and non-aerosol deodorants must be in containers no larger than 3.4 ounces (or 100 milliliters). This is the same rule that applies to other toiletry items such as shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. If the deodorant containers are larger than 3.4 ounces, they must be packed in a checked bag. 

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on Aerosol Deodorants?</h2>

In addition to the size restrictions, the TSA also has specific rules for aerosol deodorants. All aerosol containers must be placed in a clear, quart-sized bag and only one bag per passenger is allowed. This rule applies to all aerosol items, including deodorant and hairspray. The same rule applies to gel containers, including gel-based deodorant. All gel containers must also be placed in a clear, quart-sized bag. 

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on Non-Aerosol Deodorants?</h2>

Non-aerosol deodorants, such as solid and roll-on, do not need to be placed in a clear, quart-sized bag. However, they must still be within the 3.4 ounce size limit. 

<h2>What If I Have More Than 3.4 Ounces of Deodorant?</h2>

If you have more than 3.4 ounces of deodorant, it must be placed in a checked bag. This means that you cannot bring it on board the plane. It is important to note that if your checked bag is overweight, you may incur additional fees. 

<h2>Can I Bring Other Toiletry Items On a Plane?</h2>

The TSA allows passengers to bring other toiletry items, such as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and makeup, on board the plane. However, these items must also be in containers no larger than 3.4 ounces. If the containers are larger than 3.4 ounces, they must be placed in a checked bag.
