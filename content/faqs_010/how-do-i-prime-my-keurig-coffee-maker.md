<p>Keurig coffee makers are popular for their convenience and easy maintenance. But, as with any machine, regular maintenance and troubleshooting is key to ensuring that your coffee maker will work properly and make great-tasting coffee every time. One of the most common maintenance tasks you’ll need to perform on your Keurig is priming it. Priming is the process of clearing out the air pockets in the tubes and lines of the coffee maker, and it should be done at least once a month. Here’s how to do it.</p>

<h2>What is Priming a Keurig Coffee Maker?</h2>

<p>Priming a Keurig coffee maker is the process of removing the air pockets in the tubes and lines of the coffee maker. These air pockets can cause the coffee to taste stale or weak. When the air pockets are removed, the coffee maker can more efficiently extract the flavor and aroma of the ground coffee beans. Priming also helps ensure that the water is evenly distributed throughout the coffee maker, which is necessary for even extraction of the coffee.</p>
