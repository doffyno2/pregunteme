Feathers are an important part of nature. They are light, colorful, and delicate, and they can be found on many birds. But how much does a feather actually weigh?

<h2>What Are Feathers? </h2>

Feathers are specialized structures on a bird's body. They make up the bird's plumage, which is a collection of feathers that cover the bird's body and are used for flight, insulation, and protection. Feathers are made of a protein called keratin, which is also found in our hair and nails.

<h2>Why Do Feathers Weigh So Little? </h2>
