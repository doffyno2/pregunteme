<p>Breaking a chain without a chain breaker may seem like an impossible task, but it is not. In fact, with the right knowledge, it is relatively easy to break a chain without needing a chain breaker or other specialized tool. Whether you need to break a chain for repairs, or for an emergency situation, the following steps will help you do so quickly and easily.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>In order to break a chain without a chain breaker, you will need a few tools. These include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A pair of pliers</li>
    <li>A hammer</li>
    <li>A block of wood</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Locate the Weakest Link</h2>

<p>In order to break a chain without a chain breaker, you must first identify the weakest link in the chain. Look for a link that is slightly bent, or that is not as strong as other links in the chain. This is typically the weakest link, and will be the easiest to break.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Secure the Chain</h2>

<p>Once you have identified the weakest link, you need to secure the chain so that it does not move around when you attempt to break it. To do this, place the chain on a block of wood, and secure it in place using a pair of pliers.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Tap the Weakest Link</h2>

<p>Using a hammer, tap the weakest link lightly. You want to apply enough force to break the link, but not so much that you damage the other links in the chain. This may take a few tries, so be patient.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Separate the Links</h2>

<p>Once the link has been broken, use the pliers to separate the two ends of the chain. This will allow you to remove the broken link, and replace it with a new one.</p>
