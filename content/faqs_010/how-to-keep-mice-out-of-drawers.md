<p>Mice can be a real nuisance for homeowners. Not only do they spread disease, damage property, and leave droppings in their wake, but they can also enter drawers and contaminate food and other items. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to keep mice out of drawers and away from your home.</p>

<h2>Seal Up Cracks and Crevices</h2>

<p>Mice are adept climbers, and they can enter your home through even the smallest of cracks and crevices. Therefore, it is important to seal up any potential entry points, such as holes around pipes, vents, and windows. Make sure that these areas are sealed properly, as mice are very good at finding their way into your home.</p>

<h2>Use Bait Stations</h2>

<p>Bait stations can be used to trap mice that have already entered your home. These stations are designed to be placed in areas where mice are likely to enter, such as near your drawers. The bait stations are filled with a food-based bait that attracts the mice and then traps them inside. Once they are trapped, they can be released outdoors.</p>

<h2>Keep Your Home Clean and Sanitized</h2>

<p>Mice are attracted to food and other items that are lying around your home. Make sure that all food items are stored in airtight containers, and that all surfaces are regularly cleaned and sanitized. This will make it less attractive for mice to enter your home and drawers.</p>
