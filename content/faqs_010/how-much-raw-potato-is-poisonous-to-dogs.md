Dogs are widely known as man's best friend, and their loyal and loving nature makes them an ideal companion for many households. But when it comes to feeding them, it is important to be aware of the potential dangers that certain foods can cause. One particular food that pet owners should be aware of is raw potatoes, as it can be poisonous to dogs if eaten in large quantities. In this article, we will discuss what raw potatoes are, the potential risks associated with them, and how much raw potato is poisonous to dogs.

<h2>What are Raw Potatoes?</h2>

Raw potatoes are any potatoes that have not been cooked, boiled, or otherwise processed. These potatoes are usually dark in colour and have a slightly bitter taste. Raw potatoes are not recommended for human consumption, but they can be found in pet food, as they are an excellent source of carbohydrates, protein, and dietary fibre.

<h2>Are Raw Potatoes Poisonous to Dogs?</h2>

Raw potatoes may be safe to eat in small quantities, but when eaten in large quantities, they can be toxic to dogs. The toxicity occurs when a dog eats too many raw potatoes, as they contain a chemical known as solanine. Solanine is a naturally occurring glycoalkaloid toxin found in some species of the nightshade family, including potatoes. When eaten in large quantities, solanine can cause gastrointestinal distress, as well as neurological symptoms such as muscle tremors, seizures, and even death.

<h2>How Much Raw Potato is Poisonous to Dogs?</h2>

The exact amount of raw potato that is poisonous to dogs varies depending on the size and breed of the dog, as well as the type of potato. Generally speaking, it is recommended that dogs not eat more than 1/10th of their body weight in raw potatoes per day. For example, a 10-pound dog should not eat more than one ounce of raw potato per day. 

It is important to note that the toxicity of raw potatoes can vary depending on the variety of potato. For example, red potatoes contain higher levels of solanine than white potatoes, and potatoes that are green in colour or that have begun to sprout should be avoided entirely.

<h2>What are the Symptoms of Potato Poisoning in Dogs?</h2>

If a dog has eaten too many raw potatoes, the following symptoms may be observed: 

• Vomiting 
• Diarrhea 
• Abdominal pain 
• Weakness 
• Loss of appetite 
• Seizures 
• Muscle tremors 
• Difficulty breathing 
• Coma 

If any of these symptoms are observed, it is important to contact a veterinarian immediately as raw potatoes can be fatal to dogs if not treated quickly. 

<h2>Can Dogs Eat Cooked Potatoes?</h2>

Cooked potatoes are generally safe for dogs to eat in moderation, as the cooking process breaks down the solanine content. However, it is important to note that cooked potatoes should not be served with any added salt, butter, cheese, or other seasonings as these can be harmful to dogs. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In conclusion, raw potatoes can be poisonous to dogs if eaten in large quantities. The exact amount that is toxic to dogs varies depending on the size and breed of the dog, as well as the type of potato. If a dog has eaten too many raw potatoes, it is important to contact a veterinarian immediately as raw potatoes can be fatal to dogs if not treated quickly. Cooked potatoes are generally safe for dogs to eat in moderation as the cooking process breaks down the solanine content.
