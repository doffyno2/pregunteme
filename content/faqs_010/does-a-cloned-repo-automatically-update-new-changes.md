<p>A clone of a repository is a copy of the entire source code, commits, and associated files. The clone includes all the versions of the repository up to the point where the clone is created. The cloned repository can be used to make changes and commit the changes to the original repository, but it does not automatically update new changes from the original repository when those changes are made. In this article, we will discuss how to update a cloned repository with new changes from the original repository.</p>

<h2>What is a Cloned Repository?</h2>

<p>A cloned repository is an exact copy of the original repository, including all the files and commit history. It’s important to note that the cloned repository is not linked to the original repository, which means changes made to the original repository will not automatically be reflected in the cloned repository. The cloned repository can be used to make changes and commit those changes to the original repository, but it does not automatically update with new changes from the original repository.</p>

<h2>How Do You Update a Cloned Repository?</h2>

<p>In order to update a cloned repository with new changes from the original repository, you will need to use the <b>git pull</b> command. This command will pull any new changes from the original repository and apply them to the cloned repository. It’s important to note that this command will not override any changes you’ve already made to the cloned repository — it will only update the repository with new changes from the original repository.</p>

<h2>What is the Git Pull Command?</h2>

<p>The git pull command is used to download the latest changes from a remote repository. It is a combination of two other commands — git fetch and git merge. The git fetch command will download the latest changes from the remote repository, while the git merge command will merge those changes into the local repository. The git pull command combines these two commands into one, making it a more convenient way to update the local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository.</p>

<h2>How To Use the Git Pull Command?</h2>

<p>The git pull command is used to update a cloned repository with new changes from the original repository. To use the command, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory of the cloned repository, and type the command <b>git pull</b>. This will pull any new changes from the original repository and apply them to the cloned repository.</p>

<h2>How To Check if the Cloned Repository Has Been Updated?</h2>

<p>Once you’ve used the git pull command to update the cloned repository, you can check if the changes have been applied by using the <b>git status</b> command. This command will show you the list of files that have been updated in the cloned repository. If the list of files shows changes from the original repository, then the cloned repository has been successfully updated.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>A cloned repository is an exact copy of the original repository, including all the files and commit history. However, the cloned repository does not automatically update with new changes from the original repository. To update the cloned repository, you will need to use the git pull command. This command will pull any new changes from the original repository and apply them to the cloned repository. Once the git pull command has been executed, you can check if the changes have been applied by using the git status command.</p>
