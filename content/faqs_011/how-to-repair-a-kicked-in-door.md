<p>It can be a distressing experience to come home to a kicked-in door. Although it can be tempting to take matters into your own hands, it is best to call a professional locksmith who can ensure that the job is done right and the door is repaired securely. In this article, we’ll walk you through the steps of repairing a kicked-in door. </p>

<h2>Step 1: Assess the Damage</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a kicked-in door is to assess the extent of the damage. If the door can still be opened and closed, it may be possible to repair it. If the door is warped, broken, or otherwise damaged beyond repair, it may be necessary to replace it. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Secure the Area</h2>

<p>Once you have assessed the damage, it is important to secure the area. Make sure all windows and doors are locked and that you have called the police if necessary. You should also take steps to ensure that the area is safe and secure before attempting any repairs. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Remove the Door</h2>

<p>Once the area is secure, you can begin to remove the door. Be sure to wear protective gloves and eyewear to protect yourself from flying debris. If the door is still intact, you will need to remove the hinges and the door handle. If the door is warped or broken, you may need to use a saw or other cutting tool to remove it. </p>

<h2>Step 4: Prepare the Door Jamb</h2>

<p>Once the door is removed, you will need to prepare the door jamb for repairs. This may involve repairing or replacing any broken or damaged components of the jamb. You may also need to use a drill or saw to enlarge the opening of the jamb if the door is too large. </p>

<h2>Step 5: Install New Door</h2>

<p>Once the jamb is prepared, you can begin to install the new door. If the door is pre-hung, you will need to attach the hinges to the jamb and then secure the door. If the door is not pre-hung, you will need to measure and cut the door to fit the jamb and then attach the hinges. </p>

<h2>Step 6: Secure the Door</h2>

<p>Once the door is installed, you will need to secure it. This can be done by installing a deadbolt lock, a security bar, or other security devices. Be sure to install any locks and security devices according to the manufacturer’s instructions. </p>

<h2>Step 7: Check for Drafts</h2>

<p>Once the door is secured, you should check for drafts. If the door is not properly sealed, it may be possible for air to leak through the cracks and crevices. If you notice any drafts, you may need to adjust the door or add insulation to reduce air leakage. </p>
