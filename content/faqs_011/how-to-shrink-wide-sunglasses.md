It is not uncommon for people to experience problems with the size of their sunglasses, especially when the frames are too wide for their face. Fortunately, there are several ways to shrink wide sunglasses so that they fit more comfortably and look better on your face. In this article, we will discuss the various methods of shrinking wide sunglasses so that you can find the right solution for your needs. 

<h2>Understanding the Different Types of Sunglasses</h2>

Before we discuss how to shrink wide sunglasses, it is important to understand the different types of sunglasses and how they fit your face. There are two main types of sunglasses: wrap-around frames and aviators. Wrap-around frames are designed to wrap around the sides of your head, providing a snug fit and more coverage. Aviators, on the other hand, are designed to sit more on top of your head, providing more open coverage and allowing for more air flow. 

<h2>How to Shrink Wide Sunglasses</h2>

The most common way to shrink wide sunglasses is to use heat to soften the frames. This can be done by using a hair dryer or by placing the glasses in hot water for a few minutes. Be sure to move the glasses around in the water to ensure even heating. Once the frames are soft, carefully reshape them by pressing them against your face. Allow the frames to cool before removing them from your face. 

Another method of shrinking wide sunglasses is to use a combination of hot and cold water. Start by placing the glasses in hot water for a few minutes to soften the frames. Then, pour cold water over the frames to help them retain the shape you want. Allow the frames to cool before removing them from the water.

If these methods do not work for you, there are also professional services that can help you shrink your sunglasses. These services typically use an advanced method of heating and cooling to reshape the frames to fit your face. This method is more expensive than the DIY methods, but it is more reliable and will provide better results.

<h2>Tips for Shrinking Sunglasses</h2>

When shrinking your sunglasses, it is important to take your time and be careful. Sunglasses are delicate, and it is easy to damage them if you are not careful. It is also important to be aware that some materials, such as plastic or metal, may not respond well to heat. If you are unsure, it is best to consult a professional. 

It is also important to make sure that the frames are a good fit before you start shrinking them. If they are too big or too small, they may not fit properly even after you have shrunk them.
