<p>Git is a version control system used by developers to manage versioning of their code. It is a powerful tool that helps developers keep track of changes and collaborate on projects. In this tutorial, we will discuss how to update a git repo from the terminal. We will cover the most common commands and usage scenarios. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to update your git repo from the terminal with ease. </p>

<h2>What is Git?</h2>

<p>Git is a distributed version control system used by software developers to manage the source code of their projects. It is a powerful tool that helps developers keep track of changes and collaborate on projects. It allows developers to commit changes to the repository, view the history of changes, and roll back changes if needed. Git also helps developers collaborate on projects by allowing for branching and merging. </p>

<h2>Why Use Git?</h2>

<p>Git is an essential tool for developers and teams that need to collaborate on projects. It helps developers keep track of changes, view the history of changes, and roll back changes if needed.

<h2>How to Update a Git Repo from the Terminal</h2>

<p>Updating a git repo from the terminal is simple and straightforward. It requires a few simple commands and a few minutes of your time. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to update a git repo from the terminal:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Check the Status of Your Repo</h3>

<p>The first step in updating your git repo from the terminal is to check the status of your repo. You can do this by running the command “git status”. This will show you any changes made to the repo since the last update. This is a good way to make sure you are up-to-date before you start updating your repo.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Files to the Staging Area</h3>

<p>The next step is to add any changed or new files to the staging area. This is done using the command “git add” followed by the name of the file you want to add. You can also use the command “git add .” to add all changed or new files to the staging area.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Commit the Changes</h3>

<p>Once you’ve added all the changed or new files to the staging area, you can commit the changes. This is done using the command “git commit -m “message””, where message is a brief description of the changes you are committing. This message should be descriptive and concise so that other developers will know what was changed.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Push the Changes</h3>

<p>Finally, you can push the changes to the remote repository. This is done using the command “git push”. This will send all the changes to the remote repository and update your local copy of the repository.</p>
