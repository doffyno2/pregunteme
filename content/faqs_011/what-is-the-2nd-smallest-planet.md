The second smallest planet in our solar system is Venus. Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon, appearing as a bright, white dot in the sky. It is often referred to as the Morning Star or Evening Star.

<h2>Physical Characteristics of Venus</h2>

Venus has a diameter of 12,104 km, which is slightly less than the Earth's diameter of 12,742 km. This makes it the second smallest planet in our solar system after Mercury. It has an atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, and its surface is covered in a thick layer of clouds, which is why it is often referred to as Earth's twin. The clouds are made up of sulfuric acid and are thought to be responsible for Venus's high surface temperature of 462°C.

<h2>Venus's Orbit and Rotation</h2>

Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of 108.2 million km and has an orbital period of 224.7 days. It rotates around its axis in the opposite direction to most other planets, taking 243 days to complete one rotation. This means that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on the planet.

<h2>Venus's Moons and Rings</h2>

Venus does not have any moons or rings. This is because the planet is too close to the Sun for any objects to remain in orbit around it.

<h2>Exploration of Venus</h2>

The first spacecraft to visit Venus was Mariner 2 in 1962. This was followed by a number of robotic missions, which included the Soviet Venera probes and the American Pioneer probes. More recently, the European Space Agency launched the Venus Express mission in 2005 and the Japanese Akatsuki mission in 2010. 

<h2>Venus in Culture and Mythology</h2>

Venus has been a source of fascination since ancient times and has been associated with many different cultures and mythologies. In Greek mythology, Venus is the goddess of love and beauty and is the daughter of Zeus and the wife of Vulcan. In Roman mythology, Venus is the goddess of love and beauty and is the wife of Mars. In both Greek and Roman mythology, Venus is often depicted as being accompanied by a dove.
