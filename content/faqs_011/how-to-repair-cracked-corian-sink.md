<p>Corian sinks are an elegant and durable choice for your kitchen or bathroom. When properly maintained, they can last a lifetime. Unfortunately, accidents happen, and a Corian sink can develop a crack. If you discover a crack in your Corian sink, you may be wondering what to do.

The crack may be in the bowl or on the edges of the sink. The size of the crack will determine the best course of action.</p>

<h2>Gathering Materials</h2>

<p>Once you have identified the crack, you will need to gather the materials you will need to repair it. Depending on the size and location of the crack, you may need a putty knife, epoxy, sandpaper, a drill, and a sealant. Make sure you have all the materials you will need before you begin.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Sink</h2>

<p>Before you begin repairing the cracked sink, you will need to prepare it. Start by cleaning the sink and removing any debris, dirt, or grease. This will ensure that the repair adheres properly.
