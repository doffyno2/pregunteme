<p>Have you ever seen the sun looking orange? If so, you may have wondered what it means. This phenomenon is relatively rare and has different meanings depending on the time of day, season and location.</p>

<p>When the sun is orange, it typically means that the sun is rising or setting. This happens because the sun is closer to the horizon at those times and its light has to pass through more atmosphere. The atmosphere acts like a filter, so the sun's light appears warmer, or more orange.</p>

<p>The time of day and season also affect the color of the sun. During sunrise and sunset, the sun is lower in the sky and its light has to pass through more atmosphere. In the summer, when the sun is higher in the sky, its light passes through less atmosphere, so the sun appears brighter and more yellow.</p>

<p>Location also affects the color of the sun. Pollution and airborne particles can also affect the color of the sun. Pollution and dust can cause sunsets to appear more orange, while clear skies typically produce more yellow sunsets. Atmospheric conditions, such as clouds, can also affect the color of the sun.</p>
