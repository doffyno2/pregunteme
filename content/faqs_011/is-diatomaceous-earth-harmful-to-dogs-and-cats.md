<p>Diatomaceous earth, also known as DE, is a fine powder made from the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. It is used in a variety of applications, including as a natural insecticide, a food additive, and a filtering agent. But is diatomaceous earth harmful to dogs and cats?</p>

<p>The short answer is that in general, diatomaceous earth is safe for both dogs and cats. However, there are some potential health risks associated with DE, so it is important to understand how to use it safely and appropriately.</p>

<h2>What Is Diatomaceous Earth?</h2>

<p>Diatomaceous earth is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock composed of fossilized diatoms, which are microscopic aquatic organisms. It is mined from lakes, rivers, and other water sources, and is composed of silica, a compound found in many plants, animals, and other living things. DE is an absorbent material, so it can be used to absorb liquids and oils and to filter out impurities. It is also an effective insect killer, as the sharp edges of the diatoms puncture the outer shell of insects, causing them to dehydrate.</p>

<p>DE is generally safe for humans, animals, and the environment when used correctly. It is often used in gardening and farming to control pests and protect crops, and can also be used in pet products, such as flea and tick collars and dusting powders.</p>

<h2>Is Diatomaceous Earth Safe for Dogs and Cats?</h2>

It is also important to use DE products that are specifically labeled as safe for pets.</p>

<p>DE can also be a choking hazard for cats and dogs, so it is important to use it with caution and in areas where pets cannot access it. Additionally, DE can be hazardous if inhaled, so it is important to use it in well-ventilated areas and to avoid breathing in the dust.</p>
