<h2>Steps to Repair Body Damaged Car</h2>

<p>1. Start by assessing the damage. You need to determine the extent of the damage to the car’s bodywork. Check for dents, scratches, rust, and other signs of wear. This will help you decide how much work needs to be done and what tools are required.</p>

<p>3. Sand the damaged area. If the damage is minor, you may be able to sand down the affected area to smooth out any dents and scratches. This will help you prepare the surface for the repair process.</p>

<p>4. Apply primer. Once the area is sanded down and smooth, you need to apply a layer of primer to help the repair process. Primer will help create an even surface for the paint to adhere to.</p>

<p>5. Paint the area. Once the primer is dry, you can now apply the paint to the area. This will help to restore the car’s appearance and provide a protective layer that will help prevent further damage.</p>

<p>6. Apply clear coat. After the paint has dried, you need to apply a layer of clear coat to the area. This will help to protect the paint from scratches and other damage.</p>
