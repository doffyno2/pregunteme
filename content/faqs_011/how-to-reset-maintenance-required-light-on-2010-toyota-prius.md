<p>The Maintenance Required (MR) light on a 2010 Toyota Prius indicates that the car needs service or maintenance. When the light comes on, it is important that you take your car to a qualified mechanic to have the necessary work done. This article will explain how to reset the Maintenance Required light on a 2010 Toyota Prius.</p>

<h2>What Does the Maintenance Required Light Mean?</h2>

<p>The MR light is a warning that the car needs to be serviced. This light can indicate that it is time for an oil change, tire rotation, spark plug replacement, or any other type of maintenance that is required for a car to remain in good working order. If the light is not reset after the service has been completed, it will continue to come on periodically.</p>

<h2>How to Reset the Maintenance Required Light</h2>

<p>In order to reset the Maintenance Required light, you will need to have access to the diagnostic computer that is used by mechanics. You can either take your car to a qualified mechanic and have them reset the light, or you can purchase a diagnostic scanner and reset the light yourself. The following steps explain how to reset the light using a diagnostic scanner.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Locate the Diagnostic Port</h3>

<p>The first step is to locate the diagnostic port in your car. The port is usually located underneath the dashboard on the driver's side. It is a small rectangular port with a single wire attached to it.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Connect the Scanner</h3>

<p>Once the port has been located, the next step is to connect the scanner to the port. Most scanners come with a cable that can be plugged into the port. After the scanner has been connected, it should be turned on.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Access the Codes</h3>

<p>The scanner should automatically detect any codes that are stored in the car's computer. These codes will indicate what type of maintenance is required. If the Maintenance Required light is on, the code should be listed on the scanner.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Clear the Codes</h3>

<p>Once the codes have been identified, the next step is to clear them. This can be done by pressing the “Clear” button on the scanner. Once the codes have been cleared, the Maintenance Required light should turn off.</p>
