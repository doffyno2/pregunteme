<h2>What is the Max Riding Weight of the 2016 FLHT?</h2>

<h2>How Does the Max Riding Weight Affect Performance?</h2>

<p>The weight limit of 550 pounds affects the performance of the FLHT in several ways. First, the heavier the load, the slower the bike will be.

Additionally, the heavier load will cause the bike to handle differently. The steering may feel heavier and the bike may feel less responsive to rider inputs. It is important to keep the total weight of the rider, any passengers, and any cargo within the manufacturer's specified limits to ensure the best possible performance.</p>

<h2>What Should Riders Do to Ensure the Maximum Weight is Not Exceeded?</h2>

To ensure the weight of the FLHT is not exceeded, riders should try to keep their load light. This means keeping the number of passengers to a minimum and limiting the amount of cargo that is carried.
