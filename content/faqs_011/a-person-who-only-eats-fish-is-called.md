A person who only eats fish is known as a pescatarian. A pescatarian is someone who follows a vegetarian diet but occasionally eats fish and other seafood. Pescatarians do not eat any kind of meat, including poultry, beef, pork, and game.

The term pescatarian was first used in 1993 by British author Stephen R. Jones in his book “The Pescatarian Diet”. The term has since gained popularity and is now widely used to describe someone who chooses to follow a vegetarian diet but occasionally eats fish and seafood.

<h2>What is the Difference Between a Pescatarian and a Vegetarian?</h2>

The primary difference between a pescatarian and vegetarian is that pescatarians occasionally eat fish and seafood, whereas vegetarians do not. This means that a pescatarian consumes some animal proteins, but a vegetarian does not.

Pescatarians also tend to follow a largely plant-based diet, just like vegetarians. This means that they focus on eating fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and legumes. The key difference is that pescatarians also eat fish and seafood.

<h2>What are the Benefits of Following a Pescatarian Diet?</h2>

There are many benefits to following a pescatarian diet. For one, since pescatarians eat fish and seafood, they can enjoy many of the same health benefits as vegetarians. Eating fish and seafood has been linked to improved heart health, lower risk of certain cancers, and improved cognitive function.

In addition, pescatarians can benefit from the many environmental advantages of a plant-based diet. Eating less meat, dairy, and eggs can help reduce our carbon footprint and reduce the strain on our environment.

<h2>Are There Any Potential Risks to Following a Pescatarian Diet?</h2>

Like any diet, there are potential risks to following a pescatarian diet. For one, some types of fish and seafood contain high levels of mercury and other toxins. Eating too much of these can be detrimental to your health.

In addition, some pescatarians may struggle to get enough protein from their diet. If you are following a pescatarian diet, it is important to make sure that you are getting enough high-quality protein from sources such as fish, nuts, and legumes.
