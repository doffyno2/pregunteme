<p>Whether you’re a bodybuilder, a powerlifter or an everyday gym-goer, you’ve likely noticed your ribs sticking out at one point or another. It’s an annoying problem that can make you feel embarrassed and frustrated, but it’s a problem that can be solved. Here’s what you need to know about why your ribs stick out and how to fix it.</p>

<h2>What Causes Ribs to Stick Out?</h2>

<p>Your ribs sticking out can be caused by a few different factors. The most common cause is poor posture. When you slouch or hunch over, your chest compresses and your rib cage is pushed forward, making your ribs more visible. Other causes can include low body fat, an increased ribcage size, and weak core muscles. </p>

<h2>How to Fix Ribs Sticking Out</h2>

<p>The best way to fix ribs sticking out is to address the underlying cause. For poor posture, you’ll want to focus on improving your posture. This includes standing with your shoulders back, chest out, and abs pulled in. You’ll also want to make sure you’re sitting up straight when you’re at a desk or in a chair. </p>

<p>If your ribs are sticking out due to low body fat, your best bet is to focus on gaining healthy weight. This means eating a balanced diet that’s rich in healthy fats and proteins and avoiding processed foods. You should also engage in regular exercise to help build muscle and burn fat. </p>

<p>If your ribcage is larger than normal, you’ll want to focus on strengthening your core muscles. This can include exercises such as planks, mountain climbers, and crunches. Having strong core muscles will help pull your ribcage back and make your ribs less visible. </p>

<h2>What Not to Do to Fix Ribs Sticking Out</h2>
