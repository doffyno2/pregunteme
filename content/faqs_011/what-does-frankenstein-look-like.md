<p>Frankenstein is a classic horror novel written by Mary Shelley in 1818. It tells the story of a scientist named Victor Frankenstein, who creates a monster out of dead body parts.

<p>The monster has an impressive intellect, and is capable of understanding and expressing complex emotions. He is also able to read and write, which is unusual for a creature of his size and shape.

The monster also had a flat, square head in the movie, which is a far cry from Shelley's description of him.</p>

<p>In later adaptations of the Frankenstein story, the monster has been depicted in a variety of different ways. In some versions, he is portrayed as a sympathetic character, while in others he is seen as a dangerous creature who must be destroyed. He has also been portrayed as a tragic figure, and in some versions, he is portrayed as a sympathetic antihero.</p>

<h2>The Monster in Video Games</h2>

He is also a playable character in the fighting games Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Frankenstein is one of the most iconic characters in horror fiction, and he has been portrayed in many different ways in literature, movies, and video games.
