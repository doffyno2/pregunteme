<p>Theravent is a popular over the counter snoring aid. It is designed to help reduce the intensity and frequency of snoring for those who suffer from it.

However, in 2020, the company announced that it was discontinuing the product, leaving many customers wondering what happened to Theravent.</p>

<h2>What is Theravent?</h2>

<p>Theravent is a snoring aid designed to reduce snoring by providing a gentle, vibrating pressure to the throat. It is a small plastic device worn over the nose while sleeping.
