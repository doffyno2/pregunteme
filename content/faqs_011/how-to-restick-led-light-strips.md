LED Light Strips are a great way to add color and light to any room. Whether you're using them for decorative purposes, to display artwork, or just to brighten up a space, they're a great addition to any home. Unfortunately, they can sometimes lose their stickiness over time, making them difficult to keep in place. This article will explain how to restick LED Light Strips and keep them in place so that they can continue to provide light and color in your home.

<h2>What Causes LED Light Strips to Lose Their Stickiness?</h2>

There are several factors that can cause LED Light Strips to lose their stickiness. The most common cause is exposure to heat or humidity, which can cause the adhesive to break down and lose its grip. Additionally, LED Light Strips can lose their stickiness if they are moved or adjusted too frequently, or if the surface they are being attached to is not properly prepared. Finally, the adhesive on LED Light Strips can also be affected by dust, dirt, and other contaminants that can build up on the surface over time.

<h2>How to Prepare the Surface for Resticking LED Light Strips</h2>

The most important step in resticking LED Light Strips is to make sure that the surface you are attaching them to is properly prepared. This means making sure that the surface is clean, free of dust, dirt, and other contaminants that could affect the adhesive. Additionally, if you are attaching the LED Light Strips to a textured or uneven surface, it is best to sand it down lightly to ensure that the adhesive will stick properly. 

<h2>How to Restick LED Light Strips</h2>

Once you have prepared the surface you are attaching the LED Light Strips to, it is time to restick them. The first step is to remove the existing adhesive from the back of the LED Light Strip. This can be done with a combination of heat and gentle scraping. Once the adhesive has been removed, you can apply a new adhesive to the back of the LED Light Strip. It is important to make sure that the new adhesive is designed specifically for LED Light Strips and is rated for the temperature and humidity of the area where the LED Light Strip will be used. 

<h2>How to Keep LED Light Strips in Place</h2>

Once you have restuck the LED Light Strips with a new adhesive, it is important to take steps to ensure that they remain in place. The most important step is to make sure that the LED Light Strip is not exposed to excessive heat or humidity. Additionally, it is important to avoid touching or adjusting the LED Light Strip too frequently, as this can cause the adhesive to break down over time. Finally, make sure that the surface you are attaching the LED Light Strips to is kept clean and free of dust and dirt.
