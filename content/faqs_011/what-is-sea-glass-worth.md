Sea glass, also known as mermaid's tears, is a naturally occurring material that has been shaped and fragmented by the waves and sand of the ocean. It can be found in many places around the world, from the beaches of Hawaii to the shorelines of Europe. Over time, the glass is weathered and shaped into smooth, perfect pieces that are as beautiful as they are rare. 

The value of sea glass lies in its rarity and beauty. Pieces can range from common to extremely rare, depending on color and type. Some of the rarest pieces of sea glass can be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. While these pieces are rare, there are still many pieces of sea glass that are worth collecting and displaying.
