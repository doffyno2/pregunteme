<p>The threshold of an exterior door is the bottom piece of the door frame that seals the outside from the inside of your house. It’s an important part of protecting your home from the elements, and can also help to keep out pests and other unwanted visitors. If you’ve noticed that your exterior door threshold has started to wear down, it’s time to replace it. </p>

<p>Replacing an exterior door threshold isn’t a difficult job, but it does require some tools and a bit of knowledge. In this article, we’ll show you how to replace an exterior door threshold quickly and easily. </p>

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

<p>Before you get started, make sure that you have all of the tools and materials that you’ll need. Most of these can be found at your local hardware store. Here’s what you’ll need: </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Screwdriver</b> – You’ll need a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the old threshold.</li>
  <li><b>Pry Bar</b> – You’ll use the pry bar to remove the old threshold.</li>
  <li><b>New Threshold</b> – Make sure that you get a new threshold that is the same size and shape as the old one. </li>
  <li><b>Caulk Gun</b> – You’ll need a caulk gun to apply the caulk around the new threshold.</li>
  <li><b>Caulk</b> – Make sure that you get the right kind of caulk for your door type. </li>
  <li><b>Wood Glue</b> – If your threshold has a wooden insert, you’ll need wood glue to attach it. </li>
  <li><b>Paint</b> – If you’re painting your new threshold, make sure you have the right kind of paint for the job.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Remove the Old Threshold</h2>

<p>The first step is to remove the old threshold. Start by using a screwdriver to remove any screws that are holding the old threshold in place. Once the screws are removed, you can use a pry bar to carefully remove the threshold. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Clean the Area</h2>

<p>Once the old threshold is removed, use a damp cloth to clean the area around the door frame. This will help to ensure that the new threshold will fit properly. Make sure that you also check for any cracks or damage in the door frame itself. If you find any, you may need to repair them before installing the new threshold. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Measure and Cut the New Threshold</h2>

<p>Once the area is cleaned, you’ll need to measure and cut the new threshold to size. Make sure that you measure twice and cut once to ensure a perfect fit. If you’re using a wooden threshold, you’ll need to use a handsaw or jigsaw to cut it to size. </p>

<h2>Step 4: Install the New Threshold</h2>

<p>Once the new threshold is cut, you’re ready to install it. Start by applying some wood glue to the back of the threshold if necessary. Then, carefully place the threshold in the door frame and use a hammer to tap it into place. Make sure that the threshold is flush with the door frame. </p>

<h2>Step 5: Secure the Threshold</h2>

<p>Once the threshold is in place, use a screwdriver to secure it with screws. Make sure that you don’t over-tighten the screws, as this could damage the door frame. </p>

<h2>Step 6: Caulk Around the Threshold</h2>

<p>Once the threshold is secured, use a caulking gun to apply a bead of caulk around the threshold. This will help to seal the threshold and prevent water from entering the house. Allow the caulk to dry completely before moving on to the next step. </p>

<h2>Step 7: Paint the Threshold</h2>

<p>If you’re painting the threshold, now is the time to do it. Make sure that you use a paint that is designed for exterior use. Apply several coats of paint and allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next. </p>

<h2>Step 8: Finishing Touches</h2>

<p>Once the paint is dry, you’re ready to enjoy your new threshold. Make sure that you inspect it periodically to make sure that it is still in good condition. You may also want to apply a layer of sealant to prevent water from entering the house. </p>
