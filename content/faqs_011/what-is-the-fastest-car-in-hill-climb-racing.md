<h2>What Makes a Car Fast?</h2>

<p>There are several factors that determine how fast a car can go, such as the power of its engine, the weight of the car, the aerodynamics and the tires. The engine is the most important factor, as it is the source of power and determines how much power can be used to move the car. The weight of the car also has an effect, as a lighter car will be able to accelerate quicker and reach higher speeds than a heavier car. Aerodynamics also has a major effect, as a car with good aerodynamics will be able to cut through the air and reduce drag. Finally, the tires play an important role, as they provide traction that allows the car to grip the road and accelerate quickly.</p>
