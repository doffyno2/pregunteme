Hawaii is a beautiful place to visit, with its lush tropical landscape, stunning beaches, and vibrant culture. But in order to make the most of your time in the Aloha State, it's important to know what time it is in Hawaii now.

In this article, we'll explore what time it is in Hawaii now and how to adjust for different time zones. We'll also discuss the history of timekeeping in Hawaii, including the current time in Hawaii and other Hawaiian time zones.

<h2>What Time Is It In Hawaii Now?</h2>

At the time of writing, the time in Hawaii is 11:48 AM HST (Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time). The Hawaiian Islands are in the UTC - 10 Time Zone, which means they are 10 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This means that when it's 7:00am UTC, it's 9:00pm in Hawaii.

<h2>Hawaiian Time Zones</h2>

The Hawaiian Islands are located in two time zones: Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (HST) and Hawaii-Aleutian Daylight Time (HDT). Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time is the standard time zone for the Hawaiian Islands, and it's the same as UTC - 10. Hawaii-Aleutian Daylight Time is observed from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, and is one hour ahead of HST (UTC - 9). 

<h2>History of Timekeeping in Hawaii</h2>

Timekeeping in Hawaii has a long and interesting history. Before the islands were annexed by the United States, the islands used local solar time, or "Hawaiian Standard Time" (HST). When the United States annexed Hawaii in 1898, the islands began to use U.S. Standard Time (UTC - 10).

In 1955, the federal government adopted the Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone as the standard for the Hawaiian Islands. This time zone is also known as "Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time" and is the same as UTC - 10. In 1967, the state of Hawaii adopted Hawaii-Aleutian Daylight Time (HDT), which is one hour ahead of HST (UTC - 9). 

<h2>Daylight Saving Time in Hawaii</h2>

Hawaii does not observe Daylight Saving Time, so the time remains the same year-round. This means that when it's 7:00am UTC, it's 9:00pm in Hawaii every day of the year.

<h2>What Time Is It In Other Hawaiian Time Zones?</h2>

In addition to Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (HST) and Hawaii-Aleutian Daylight Time (HDT), there are several other time zones in the Hawaiian Islands. These include: 

<h3>Central Hawaiian Standard Time (CHST)</h3>

Central Hawaiian Standard Time (CHST) is 11 hours behind UTC, or one hour behind HST. This time zone is used in the Midway Islands and Wake Island. 

<h3>Eastern Hawaiian Standard Time (EHST)</h3>

Eastern Hawaiian Standard Time (EHST) is 12 hours behind UTC, or two hours behind HST. This time zone is used in Johnston Island and Kingman Reef.
