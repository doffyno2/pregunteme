MDR1 is a genetic mutation that affects certain breeds of dogs, including collies, Shetland sheepdogs, Australian shepherds, and mixed-breed dogs. These dogs are predisposed to certain side effects from certain drugs, including certain flea and tick medications. So, if you have an MDR1 dog, the question of whether NexGard is safe for your pet is a legitimate one.

<h2>What is NexGard?</h2>

NexGard is a flea and tick medication that is available as both a soft chew and an oral suspension. It is part of the afoxolaner family of products, which works by killing existing fleas and ticks and preventing new infestations. It is a broad-spectrum medication, which means it is effective against a wide range of pests.

<h2>Is NexGard Safe for MDR1 Dogs?</h2>

The short answer is yes, NexGard is generally safe for MDR1 dogs. However, it is always important to consult with your veterinarian before giving any medication to your pet. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your pet's individual needs and determine if NexGard is the best flea and tick medication for your pet.

<h2>What Are the Side Effects of NexGard?</h2>

As with any medication, there is the potential for side effects. The most common side effects of NexGard include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, decreased appetite, and itching. It is important to note that these side effects are usually mild and should resolve on their own. If they do not resolve, it is important to contact your veterinarian.

<h2>What Are the Risks of NexGard for MDR1 Dogs?</h2>

The most significant risk of NexGard for MDR1 dogs is ivermectin toxicity. Ivermectin is an ingredient in NexGard, and it can cause serious side effects in MDR1 dogs. The risk of ivermectin toxicity is particularly high in collies and other MDR1-affected breeds. Therefore, it is important to discuss your pet's individual risk with your veterinarian before administering NexGard.

<h2>What Are the Alternatives to NexGard?</h2>

If you have an MDR1 dog, there are other options available for flea and tick prevention. Many of these medications contain a different active ingredient than NexGard and are safe for MDR1 dogs. Your veterinarian can help you determine which medication is best for your pet.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

NexGard is generally safe for MDR1 dogs, but it is always important to consult with your veterinarian before giving any medication to your pet. Your veterinarian can help you assess your pet's individual risk and determine if NexGard is the best option for your pet. If your pet is at risk of ivermectin toxicity, there are other alternatives available. With the proper precautions, NexGard can be a safe and effective flea and tick medication for MDR1 dogs.
