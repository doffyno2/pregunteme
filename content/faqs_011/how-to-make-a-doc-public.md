<p>Sharing documents and other files is a common practice in many businesses. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to make a doc public in order to share it with a wider audience. This can be done in a few simple steps, and it is important to understand the process so that you can ensure the security of the document in question.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Changing the Privacy Settings</h2>

<p>The first step to making a doc public is to change the privacy settings of the document. This can be done in any document sharing service, such as Google Docs or Dropbox.
