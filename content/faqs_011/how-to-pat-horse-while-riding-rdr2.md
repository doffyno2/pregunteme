<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) is an open-world action-adventure video game developed and published by Rockstar Games. Set in the 19th century, the game follows the story of Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. One of the features of the game is that you can interact with the horses in the game. This includes the ability to pat them while riding. Here is how to do it.</p>

<h2>How to Access the Horse Controls</h2>

<p>The first step to patting your horse while riding is to access the horse controls. To do this, press and hold the left trigger (LT) button on the controller. This brings up a radial menu with several options, including the option to pat your horse. You can also access this menu by pressing the down button on the D-pad.</p>

<h2>How to Pat Your Horse</h2>

<p>Once you have the horse controls menu open, you can select the “Pat Horse” option by pressing the A button on the controller. This will make Arthur Morgan reach out and pat the horse on the neck. Your horse will also respond to the patting by making a unique sound, depending on its breed.</p>

<h2>How to Stop Patting Your Horse</h2>

<p>To stop patting your horse, press the B button on the controller. This will make Arthur Morgan stop patting the horse and the horse controls menu will close. You can also close the menu by pressing the left trigger (LT) button again.</p>

<h2>Tips for Patting Your Horse</h2>

<p>When patting your horse, always make sure you do it gently. Too much patting or patting too hard can cause your horse to become nervous or agitated. If your horse does become agitated, stop patting and give it some time to calm down before you try again.</p>

<p>Also, when patting your horse, be sure to use both hands. This helps to ensure that the horse is evenly patted and that all areas of the neck are covered. This will help to keep your horse from becoming agitated or uncomfortable.</p>
