How to Make a Homemade Thundershirt for Your Dog

Dogs can suffer from a variety of anxiety issues, including fear of thunderstorms, loud noises, and separation anxiety. If your dog is having difficulty dealing with anxiety, you may want to consider making a homemade thundershirt for them. A thundershirt is a type of garment that is designed to help calm your dog’s anxiety by providing a gentle, constant pressure against their body. Homemade thundershirts are easy to make and can be tailored to your dog’s unique body shape and size. In this article, we will discuss how to make a homemade thundershirt for your dog.



A thundershirt is a garment that applies gentle, constant pressure to your dog’s body in order to help reduce their anxiety. This type of pressure is said to have a calming effect on dogs, due to the fact that it mimics the pressure they would receive when being cuddled or held by their owners. There are a variety of different types of thundershirts available on the market, including ones made from fabric and ones made from neoprene.



Making a homemade thundershirt for your dog is a fairly simple and straightforward process. The first step is to measure your dog’s chest circumference and length from neck to tail. You will then use these measurements to cut out the fabric for the thundershirt. The fabric should be cut into two pieces that are the same size, one for the front and one for the back of the thundershirt.

<h2>Step 1: Choose the Right Fabric</h2>

The type of fabric you choose for your thundershirt will depend on your dog’s size and preference. If your dog is small, you may want to use a lightweight cotton fabric. If your dog is larger, you may want to use a thicker fabric such as fleece. You can also use any other fabric that is soft and breathable.

<h2>Step 2: Cut Out the Fabric</h2>

Once you have chosen the right fabric for your thundershirt, you can begin cutting out the pieces. You will need to cut out two pieces of fabric that are the same size, one for the front and one for the back of the thundershirt. The length of the pieces should be equal to the length from your dog’s neck to tail, and the width should be equal to your dog’s chest circumference.

<h2>Step 3: Sew the Pieces Together</h2>

Once you have cut out the two pieces of fabric, you can begin sewing them together. Make sure you use a sturdy thread and a needle appropriate for the type of fabric you are using. Sew the two pieces together along the edges, leaving a small opening at the neck and tail for the Velcro straps.

<h2>Step 4: Add the Velcro Straps</h2>

Once you have sewn the two pieces of fabric together, you can begin adding the Velcro straps. The Velcro straps will help keep the thundershirt in place and provide additional pressure against your dog’s body. Cut two strips of Velcro that are the same length as the opening at the neck and tail of the thundershirt. Attach one side of the Velcro to the inside of the thundershirt and the other side to the outside.

<h2>Step 5: Try It On Your Dog</h2>

Once you have finished making your homemade thundershirt, you can try it on your dog to make sure it fits correctly. The thundershirt should be snug but not too tight. You may need to adjust the Velcro straps to get the right fit.
