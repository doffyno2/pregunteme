Will There Be a Cycle 25 of ANTM? 



<p>America’s Next Top Model, or ANTM, is a popular reality show that has been running since 2003. It follows a group of aspiring models as they compete for a contract with a major modeling agency and the title of “America’s Next Top Model”. The show has had 23 cycles and is currently on the air for its 24th season. Fans of the show are wondering if there will be a cycle 25 of ANTM.</p>

<p>The answer to this question is still up in the air. The show’s future is uncertain, as its ratings have been declining in recent years and its original host, Tyra Banks, stepped down from her role in 2018. However, the show still has a strong fan base and could potentially return for another cycle if the ratings improve.</p>

<p>In the meantime, fans of the show can still tune in to watch the current cycle. This season features a new host, former model and actress Rita Ora, as well as a new panel of judges. The show has also introduced a new format, with the contestants competing in “challenge rounds” that test their skills as models.

<p>Ultimately, it is still uncertain whether or not there will be a cycle 25 of ANTM. With the show’s declining ratings, it is possible that the show may be cancelled before it can reach its 25th cycle. However, the show’s new format and new host have helped to boost ratings, so it is still possible that the show could be renewed for another cycle.</p>
