<p>A Visa gift card is a prepaid card that can be used as a form of payment at any merchant that accepts Visa debit cards. Visa gift cards are becoming increasingly popular as they are a convenient and secure way to give money to someone without having to worry about carrying cash. However, many people are unsure how to use their Visa gift cards, and this includes knowing where to find the promotional code.</p>

<p>The promotional code is a unique combination of numbers and letters that can be used to get a discount or other offer. It is usually found on the back of the card and is typically eight digits long. On a Visa gift card, the promotional code can be found in the bottom right-hand corner. It is usually surrounded by a black border that helps make it easier to spot.</p>
