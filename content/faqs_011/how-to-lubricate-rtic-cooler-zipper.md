<p>Having an RTIC cooler is a great way to keep your food and drinks cold while you're out and about. But one thing that can be frustrating is when the zipper gets stuck and won't open or close. This can be especially annoying when you need to get something out of the cooler quickly. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to lubricate your cooler's zipper and get it working again.</p>

<h2>Why Do Zippers Get Stuck?</h2>

<p>Zippers can get stuck for a few different reasons. The most common cause is simply dirt and debris that has collected on the zipper teeth. This can cause the zipper to get stuck, as the dirt and debris gets caught in the tiny spaces between the teeth. It can also cause the zipper to become misaligned, making it difficult to open and close.</p> 

<p>Another cause of a stuck zipper is a lack of lubrication. Zippers are made of metal and plastic, and over time, the metal can corrode and the plastic can become brittle. This can cause the zipper to get stuck, as the metal and plastic can't move smoothly over each other.</p> 

<h2>How to Lubricate an RTIC Cooler Zipper</h2>

<p>Fortunately, lubricating your RTIC cooler zipper is a relatively easy process. The first step is to clean the zipper teeth. This can be done with a soft cloth, a toothbrush, or even a cotton swab. Make sure to get in between the tiny spaces of the zipper teeth to remove any dirt and debris that has built up.</p> 

<p>Once the zipper teeth are clean, it's time to lubricate. You can use a commercial lubricant, such as WD-40, or you can use a lubricant specifically designed for zippers, such as Zip Lube. Whichever lubricant you choose, make sure to apply it sparingly. Too much lubricant can cause the zipper teeth to become sticky and can attract more dirt and debris, making the problem worse.</p> 

<p>Once you've applied the lubricant, use a toothbrush or cotton swab to spread it evenly over the zipper teeth. This will help ensure that the lubricant reaches all the tiny spaces and will help the zipper move smoothly. You may need to apply more lubricant if the zipper still feels sticky.</p> 

<p>Finally, you'll want to test the zipper to make sure it's working properly. Slowly open and close the zipper to make sure it's moving smoothly. If it's still sticking, you may need to apply more lubricant.</p> 

<h2>Tips for Keeping Your RTIC Cooler Zipper Working Properly</h2>

<p>In addition to lubricating your zipper, there are a few other things you can do to keep it working properly. First, make sure to clean the zipper teeth regularly. This can be done with a soft cloth, a toothbrush, or even a cotton swab. This will help keep the zipper clean and free of dirt and debris.</p> 

<p>You should also make sure to store your cooler in a cool, dry place. Heat and humidity can cause the zipper to corrode, which can make it stick. If you're storing your cooler outside, make sure to cover it with a tarp or other waterproof cover to protect it from the elements.</p> 

<p>Finally, you should check the zipper regularly for signs of wear and tear. If the zipper is starting to show signs of corrosion or damage, it's best to replace it as soon as possible. This will help ensure that your cooler stays working properly.</p>
