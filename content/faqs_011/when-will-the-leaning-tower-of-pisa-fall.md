The Leaning Tower of Pisa is an iconic landmark, located in the Italian city of Pisa. It has become a symbol of Italy and is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. But with its reputation as a leaning tower, the question on everyone's mind is when will it fall?

<h2>History of the Leaning Tower of Pisa</h2>

The Leaning Tower of Pisa began as a part of a complex of buildings, which includes a cathedral and a baptistry. It was built in the 1173, and the tower began to lean soon after construction began. The soil beneath the tower was too soft and gave way, causing it to lean to one side.

<h2>Attempts to Save the Tower</h2>

Over the years, many attempts have been made to save the Leaning Tower of Pisa from falling. In the late 19th century, a project was undertaken to attempt to stabilize the tower. The project involved digging out the soil beneath the tower and inserting iron bars and concrete to help support the weight of the structure. This project was successful and the tower was stabilized for several decades.

<h2>Recent Conservation Efforts</h2>

In the 1990s, further efforts were made to try to save the tower from collapsing. A project was undertaken to reduce the tilt of the tower by 4 degrees. This project involved removing soil from the foundation and adding steel and concrete supports. The project was successful and the tilt of the tower was reduced by 4 degrees.

<h2>The Future of the Tower</h2>

Despite these efforts, the tower is still slowly leaning. The latest estimates suggest that the tower is likely to collapse within the next 200 years. However, it is impossible to predict the exact date of the tower's collapse.

<h2>The Leaning Tower of Pisa Today</h2>

Despite its uncertain future, the tower continues to be a popular tourist attraction. The tower is open to the public and visitors can climb to the top and enjoy the view of the city. The tower is also home to a number of bells which are regularly rung.
