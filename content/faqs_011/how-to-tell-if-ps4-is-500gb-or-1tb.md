<p>Do you have a PlayStation 4 and want to know if it is a 500GB or 1TB console? Don't worry, this guide is here to help you. We'll explain the different ways to tell if your PS4 is 500GB or 1TB, as well as how to upgrade your PS4's storage capacity.</p>

<h2>How to Tell if Your PS4 is 500GB or 1TB</h2>

<p>To tell if your PS4 is 500GB or 1TB, you'll need to look at the system's specifications and compare them to the different models available. The easiest way to tell is by looking at the product name on the box. A 500GB PS4 will be labeled as "CUH-1115A" or "CUH-1215A," while a 1TB model will be labeled as "CUH-1116A" or "CUH-1216A." If you don't have the original box, you can also look at the serial number on the back of the console. A 500GB PS4 will have the serial number "CUH-1xxxA," while a 1TB model will have the serial number "CUH-2xxxA."</p>

<h2>How to Upgrade Your PS4's Storage Capacity</h2>

<p>If you want to upgrade your PS4's storage capacity, you have several options. The first and simplest option is to replace the internal hard drive with a larger one. You can find internal hard drives for PS4 online or at a local electronics store. The second option is to use an external hard drive. External hard drives can be connected to your PS4 via USB, and will allow you to store more games, apps, and other data. Finally, you can also upgrade to a PS4 Pro, which comes with a 1TB hard drive.</p>
