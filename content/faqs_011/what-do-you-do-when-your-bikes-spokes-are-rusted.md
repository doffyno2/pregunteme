<p>If you've been riding your bike for a while, you may have noticed that the spokes on your bicycle wheel are starting to look more than a little rusty. Rust can cause the spokes to break, making it difficult to ride your bike. So, what do you do when your bike's spokes are rusted?</p>

<p>The first step is to inspect the wheel. Look for any signs of rust, as well as any other damage. If you find any, you'll want to address the issue before it gets any worse. You'll also want to check for any cracks in the wheel, as these can weaken the spokes and cause them to break.</p>

<p>Once you've inspected the wheel, you'll want to clean it. This can be done with a wire brush and some soap and water. You'll want to make sure you scrub the wheel thoroughly, as rust can spread quickly if it's not removed. If you don't have a wire brush, you can also use steel wool to remove the rust.</p>

<p>Once the wheel is clean, it's time to lubricate the spokes. This will help to prevent any further rusting and keep the spokes in good condition. You can use any type of lubricant, such as WD-40, but make sure you don't use any type of oil, as this can attract dirt and debris which can cause the spokes to break.</p>

<p>Now that you've cleaned and lubricated the wheel, it's time to check the tension. If the spokes are too loose, you run the risk of them breaking. To check the tension, you can use a spoke tension gauge. If the gauge shows that the tension is too low, you'll want to tighten the spokes using a spoke wrench.</p>

<p>If the spokes are too tight, you'll need to loosen them. This can be done with a spoke wrench or a spoke key. You'll want to be careful not to over-tighten or over-loosen the spokes, as this can cause them to break.</p>

<p>Once the wheel is properly tensioned, you'll want to inspect it again for any signs of rust or other damage. If you find any, you'll want to address it before you ride the bike. You may need to repeat the cleaning and lubrication process in order to keep the spokes in good condition.</p>

<h2>Preventing Rust on Your Bike's Spokes</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent rust on your bike's spokes is to keep the wheel clean and dry. You should also inspect the wheel regularly for any signs of rust or damage. If you find any, you'll want to address it right away.</p>

<p>You should also avoid riding your bike in wet conditions, as this can cause the spokes to rust. If you do need to ride in wet conditions, you should make sure the wheel is dry before you start riding.</p>

<p>Finally, you should apply a rust-proof coating to the wheel. This can help to prevent rust from forming in the future and will make it easier to keep the wheel clean and dry.</p>
