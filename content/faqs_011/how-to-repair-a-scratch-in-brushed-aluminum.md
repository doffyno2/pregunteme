Brushed aluminum is a popular material for many items, from furniture to kitchen appliances. Its glossy, silver finish is attractive and durable, but it is also prone to scratches and scuffs. If you have a scratch in brushed aluminum, there are a few simple steps you can take to repair it. With a bit of patience and the right materials, you can restore the glossy finish of your brushed aluminum and make it look like new again.

<h2>What You Need to Repair Scratched Brushed Aluminum</h2>

Before you start repairing the brushed aluminum, you need to gather a few materials. You will need an abrasive cloth, such as wet and dry sandpaper, steel wool, or a special abrasive cloth designed for aluminum. You will also need a polishing compound specifically designed for aluminum, as well as a soft cloth for polishing.

<h2>Steps to Repair Brushed Aluminum</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Clean the Area</h3>

The first step in repairing scratched brushed aluminum is to clean the area. Use a damp cloth and mild detergent to wipe away any dirt or debris from the surface. Allow the area to dry completely before continuing.

<h3>Step 2: Sand the Scratch</h3>

Once the area is clean, use the abrasive cloth to sand the scratch. Start with a coarse grit and gradually move to a finer grit until you have removed all traces of the scratch. Take your time and be sure to sand in the same direction as the grain of the aluminum.

<h3>Step 3: Buff the Area</h3>

Once the scratch has been removed, buff the area with a soft cloth. This will help to restore the shine and smoothness of the brushed aluminum.

<h3>Step 4: Apply Polishing Compound</h3>

Next, apply a small amount of polishing compound to the area. Use a soft cloth to buff the compound into the aluminum. This will help to restore the glossy finish and make the brushed aluminum look like new again. 

<h3>Step 5: Wipe Away Excess Compound</h3>

Once you’ve applied the polishing compound, use a damp cloth to wipe away any excess. This will help to prevent any residues from forming on the brushed aluminum.
