It is the foundation of any successful relationship, whether it be with a friend, a partner, or yourself. But how do you start an honest heart? Here are some tips to help you begin your journey.</p>

<h2>Listen to Your Heart</h2>

<p>Start by tuning in to what your heart is telling you. Spend some time in silence, away from all of the outside noise and distractions.

This will help you get in touch with your authentic self and open up to the possibility of an honest heart.</p>

<h2>Be Self-Aware</h2>

<p>The next step is to become aware of your thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Notice when you are not being honest with yourself or others. Ask yourself why you may be lying or withholding the truth. Is it because you are afraid of being judged or of disappointing someone? Understanding why you are not being truthful can help you gain insight into your behavior and make changes.</p>

<p>Having a strong support system is important when striving for an honest heart. Find someone who you can trust and confide in. This can be a friend, a family member, or even a counselor. Talking with someone who you trust can help you stay accountable to your intention and can provide you with the necessary support to maintain an honest heart.</p>
