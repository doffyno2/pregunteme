BMX bikes are incredibly popular, and there are a seemingly endless variety of models available. While some models are mass-produced for the masses, some are incredibly rare and sought after by collectors. But what is the rarest BMX bike, and why is it so sought after?

<h2>The History of BMX Bikes</h2>

BMX bikes have a long and storied history, with the first BMX bikes being made in the late 1960s. The bikes were designed to imitate the look and feel of the larger, more powerful motocross bikes that were popular during the time. BMX bikes quickly rose in popularity, becoming a staple of American culture in the 1970s.

<h2>The Rise of Freestyle BMX</h2>

In the early 1980s, a new type of BMX riding began to emerge. Freestyle BMX riders began performing tricks and stunts on their bikes, and the sport quickly gained popularity. Freestyle BMXers began to customize their bikes with new parts and accessories, allowing them to perform more complex tricks. This led to the development of new types of BMX bikes specifically designed for freestyle riding.
