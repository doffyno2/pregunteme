Hotels all around the world have been known to avoid having a 13th floor, even going so far as to skip from the 12th floor to the 14th. But why is this? What is the history behind this superstitious avoidance?

<h2>The History of the 13th Floor</h2>

The superstition of avoiding a 13th floor dates back to the late 19th century, when the idea of “unlucky 13” began to take hold in popular culture. This superstition was based on the belief that the number 13 was unlucky, and that it could bring bad luck to anyone who encountered it.

The superstition was so pervasive that it even made its way into the design of many buildings, including hotels. In fact, it's believed that the first hotel to omit a 13th floor was the New Yorker Hotel in 1922, which skipped straight from the 12th floor to the 14th. 

<h2>The Fear Behind the 13th Floor</h2>

The avoidance of a 13th floor is rooted in an age-old fear that it may bring bad luck or misfortune to anyone who encounters it, or anyone who stays in a room on the 13th floor. This fear often has its roots in religion or mythology, with some cultures believing that the number 13 is associated with evil or bad luck.

In some cases, the fear of the 13th floor is so strong that people will refuse to stay in a room on the 13th floor, or even in a building that has a 13th floor. This fear is so pervasive that some hotels have even done away with the concept of a 13th floor altogether, instead opting to go straight from the 12th floor to the 14th.

<h2>The Popularity of the 13th Floor</h2>

Despite its superstitious connotations, the 13th floor has become increasingly popular in recent years. In fact, some hotels have even embraced the concept of a 13th floor and have used it to their advantage, creating “lucky” rooms on the 13th floor or offering special deals or discounts for guests who stay in these rooms.

This newfound popularity has been driven by the fact that many people no longer believe in the superstitions associated with the number 13, and instead view it as a lucky number. As such, hotels have been able to capitalize on the positive connotations associated with the number 13 and offer special deals or discounts to guests who are willing to stay in rooms on the 13th floor.
