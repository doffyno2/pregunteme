<h2>What You Need to Know Before You Start</h2>

<p>Before you dive in and begin training your pup to lick your penis, there are a few things that you need to know. First, it is important to remember that your dog will not be able to understand the same language that humans do. You will need to learn how to use positive reinforcement and reward-based training in order to successfully train your pup to lick your penis. Additionally, it is important to understand that this type of behavior can be dangerous for your pup, so it is important to take safety precautions.</p>

<h2>Steps for Training Your Dog to Lick Your Penis</h2>

Make sure that you are consistent with your commands and rewards so that your pup can learn quickly. Additionally, it is important to establish a set time each day for your pup to practice the trick.</p>

<h3>2. Introduce the Command</h3>

<p>Once you have established a routine, it is time to introduce the command. You can start by saying the phrase, “Lick my penis” in a clear and firm voice.
