<p>Whether itâ€™s a newly built home, or an older one, cracks in the drywall seams of ceilings can happen. These cracks can be unsightly and need to be repaired to maintain the structural integrity of the ceiling. In some cases, the crack may require more than a simple patch job. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to repair these cracks.</p>

<h2>What Causes Seam Cracks?</h2>

<p>The most common cause of drywall seam cracks is the normal settling of a home over time. As the foundation shifts, the drywall will shift as well, causing the seams to break. Other causes include improper installation of the drywall, or damage from a plumbing or roof leak.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed for Repair</h2>

<p>Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drywall saw</li>
  <li>Sandpaper</li>
  <li>Drywall compound</li>
  <li>Joint tape</li>
  <li>Putty knife</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps for Repairing Drywall Seam Cracks</h2>

<p>Once you have gathered the necessary tools and materials, you can begin the repair process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the drywall saw to cut away any loose pieces of drywall. </li>
  <li>Clean the edges of the crack with sandpaper. </li>
  <li>Use a putty knife to fill the crack with drywall compound. </li>
  <li>Allow the compound to dry completely. </li>
  <li>Apply a coat of joint tape to the crack. </li>
  <li>Apply another coat of drywall compound over the joint tape. </li>
  <li>Smooth the compound with a putty knife. </li>
  <li>Allow the compound to dry completely. </li>

</ol>

<h2>Tips for a Successful Repair</h2>
