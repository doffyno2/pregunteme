<p>Interphase is the first stage of the cell cycle, which is the process by which a cell grows and divides. During this stage, the cell performs all its normal metabolic functions, grows in size and prepares for division. Interphase is divided into three distinct phases; G1, S, and G2. Each of these phases has specific steps that are necessary for the cell cycle to proceed.</p>

<h2>What is G1 Phase?</h2>

<p>G1 phase is the first stage of interphase and usually lasts between 6 and 12 hours. During this phase, the cell grows in size and performs all its normal metabolic functions, such as respiration and protein synthesis. During G1, the cell also prepares for DNA replication by synthesizing enzymes and proteins necessary for this process. At the end of G1, the cell enters the S phase.</p>

<h2>What is S Phase?</h2>

<p>S phase is the second phase of interphase and usually lasts between 8 and 10 hours. During this phase, the cell replicates its DNA in a process known as DNA synthesis. During this process, the cell produces two exact copies of its genetic material. At the end of S phase, the cell enters G2 phase.</p>

<h2>What is G2 Phase?</h2>

<p>G2 phase is the third and final phase of interphase and usually lasts between 4 and 6 hours. During this phase, the cell performs final preparations for cell division. During G2, the cell synthesizes proteins and enzymes needed for the process of cytokinesis, which is the process of separating the replicated genetic material into two distinct cells. At the end of G2, the cell enters the M phase.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is interphase?</h3>
<p>Interphase is the first stage of the cell cycle, which is the process by which a cell grows and divides. During this stage, the cell performs all its normal metabolic functions, grows in size and prepares for division.</p>

<h3>How long does interphase last?</h3>
<p>Interphase typically lasts between 18 and 24 hours, depending on the type of cell.</p>

<h3>What happens during G1 phase?</h3>
<p>During G1 phase, the cell grows in size and performs all its normal metabolic functions such as respiration and protein synthesis. During G1, the cell also prepares for DNA replication by synthesizing enzymes and proteins necessary for this process.</p>

<h3>What happens during S phase?</h3>
<p>During S phase, the cell replicates its DNA in a process known as DNA synthesis. During this process, the cell produces two exact copies of its genetic material.</p>

<h3>What happens during G2 phase?</h3>
<p>During G2 phase, the cell performs final preparations for cell division. During G2, the cell synthesizes proteins and enzymes needed for the process of cytokinesis, which is the process of separating the replicated genetic material into two distinct cells.</p>

<h3>What is the purpose of interphase?</h3>
<p>The purpose of interphase is to prepare the cell for cell division. During interphase, the cell grows in size, replicates its DNA, and synthesizes proteins and enzymes necessary for cell division.</p>

<h3>How many phases are in interphase?</h3>
<p>Interphase is divided into three distinct phases; G1, S, and G2.</p>

<h3>What comes after interphase?</h3>
<p>At the end of interphase, the cell enters the M phase, which is the fourth and final stage of the cell cycle.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between interphase and mitosis?</h3>
<p>Interphase is the first stage of the cell cycle, while mitosis is the fourth and final stage of the cell cycle. During interphase, the cell grows in size and prepares for cell division. During mitosis, the cell physically divides its replicated genetic material into two distinct cells.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between G1 and G2 phases?</h3>
<p>G1 phase is the first stage of interphase and usually lasts between 6 and 12 hours. During this phase, the cell grows in size and performs all its normal metabolic functions, such as respiration and protein synthesis. G2 phase is the third and final phase of interphase and usually lasts between 4 and 6 hours. During this phase, the cell performs final preparations for cell division by synthesizing proteins and enzymes needed for the process of cytokinesis.</p>

<h3>What is DNA synthesis?</h3>
<p>DNA synthesis is the process by which the cell replicates its DNA during S phase. During this process, the cell produces two exact copies of its genetic material.</p>

<h3>What is cytokinesis?</h3>
<p>Cytokinesis is the process of separating the replicated genetic material into two distinct cells. It occurs at the end of G2 phase, when the cell is ready to divide.</p>

<h3>What is the importance of interphase?</h3>
<p>Interphase is essential for the cell cycle to proceed. During this stage, the cell grows in size, replicates its DNA, and synthesizes proteins and enzymes necessary for cell division.</p>

<h3>How does interphase differ from other stages of the cell cycle?</h3>
<p>Interphase is the first stage of the cell cycle, while other stages such as Mitosis and Cytokinesis occur after interphase. During interphase, the cell grows in size, replicates its DNA, and synthesizes proteins and enzymes necessary for cell division. During Mitosis and Cytokinesis, the cell physically divides its replicated genetic material into two distinct cells.</p>
