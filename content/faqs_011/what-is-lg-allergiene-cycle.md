<p>The LG Allergiene™ Cycle is an advanced laundry cycle designed by LG to effectively remove allergens and irritants from clothes and bedding. The cycle uses a combination of steam and high-temperature water to penetrate deep into fabrics to sanitize and freshen them. The cycle has been designed to remove up to 95% of dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and other allergens from your laundry, making it ideal for those with allergies or asthma.</p>

<p>The Allergiene Cycle begins with a prewash cycle that uses hot water and detergent to loosen and remove dirt and debris from your fabrics. Next, the cycle uses a sanitizing wash cycle that combines steam and hot water to penetrate deep into fabrics. This sanitizing wash cycle is designed to reach temperatures of over 160°F, which is hot enough to kill dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and other allergens. The cycle then follows up with a rinse cycle that uses cold water to rinse away any remaining detergent, as well as any allergens that may have been loosened during the prewash and sanitizing wash cycles.</p> 

<p>The LG Allergiene Cycle also includes an optional steam cycle that helps to further remove allergens, as well as an additional rinse cycle to remove any detergent or allergens that may be left behind. The cycle also includes a low-temperature drying cycle to help reduce static cling and wrinkles in fabrics, as well as a cool-down cycle to help protect your fabrics from heat damage.</p>
