Pregnancy is an exciting journey that can be filled with anticipation, joy, and uncertainty. As soon as you find out you're pregnant, you've likely started counting down the weeks until your little one arrives. One question many expectant mothers ask is, "If I'm 29 weeks pregnant, how many months am I?" The answer is seven months.

<h2>How Is Pregnancy Calculated?</h2>

When it comes to calculating your pregnancy, the medical community typically uses a 40-week timeline (also known as the gestational age). This timeline starts on the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). This is important to remember, as your due date is calculated from the first day of your last period, not the day of conception.

<h2>What Is a Trimester?</h2>

A trimester is a three-month period used to measure the stages of pregnancy. Most pregnancies last 40 weeks, or 10 months, and can be broken down into three trimesters. The first trimester is from week one to week 12, the second trimester is from week 13 to week 28, and the third trimester is from week 29 to week 40.

<h2>When Do the Months of Pregnancy Start?</h2>

The months of pregnancy start at week four and last until the end of the 40th week. The first month is from week four to week seven, the second month is from week eight to week 11, and so on until the 10th month (week 36 to week 40). Therefore, if you are 29 weeks pregnant, you are in your seventh month of pregnancy.

<h2>What Is Happening at 29 Weeks?</h2>

At 29 weeks pregnant, your baby is about the size of a butternut squash. At this stage, he or she is starting to fill out, with the skin smoothing out as fat accumulates beneath it. Your baby's brain is still growing rapidly and the lungs are continuing to mature. As your baby grows, you may feel more movement and pressure in your abdomen.
