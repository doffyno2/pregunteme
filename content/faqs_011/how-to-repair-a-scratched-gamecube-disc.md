<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<p>Before you can repair your Gamecube disc, you'll need to gather a few supplies. You'll need a soft cloth, some rubbing alcohol, a cotton swab, and some toothpaste. Depending on the severity of the scratch, you may also need some fine sandpaper.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Disc</h2>

<p>The first step to repairing your scratched disc is to give it a good cleaning. Take your soft cloth and lightly dampen it with rubbing alcohol. Gently wipe the disc from the center outwards, being careful not to press too hard. This will help to remove any dirt or dust that might be clogging up the scratch.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Polish the Disc</h2>

<p>Once the disc is clean, you can begin polishing it. Take a small amount of toothpaste and rub it onto the disc in a circular motion. This will help to fill in any minor scratches and make the surface of the disc smoother. Be sure to rinse the disc off with water once you're done.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Sand the Disc</h2>

<p>If the scratch is still visible after polishing, you may need to sand it. Take some fine-grit sandpaper and lightly sand the area around the scratch. Be sure to work in a circular motion, and be very careful not to press too hard. Once the area is sanded, wipe it off with a clean cloth and then give it another polish with the toothpaste.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Test the Disc</h2>

<p>Once you've finished polishing and sanding the disc, it's time to test it out. Place the disc into your Gamecube and see if it plays. If the disc works, then you're all done! If not, then you may need to repeat the steps until the disc is repaired.</p>
