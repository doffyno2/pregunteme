Soccer jerseys are a popular item of clothing for people of all ages and sizes. It's important to ensure that your jersey fits properly, and sometimes that means shrinking it to get the right fit. Shrinking a jersey can be a tricky process, but with the right technique you can get the perfect fit. Here's how to shrink a soccer jersey.

<h2>Pre-Shrinking Prep</h2>

Before you start shrinking your soccer jersey, it's important to prepare it for the process. Start by checking the label for any special instructions for washing and drying the jersey. Be sure to follow these instructions carefully to ensure that the jersey comes out looking its best.

Next, turn the jersey inside out and place it in the washing machine. Run a cold water cycle with a mild detergent, and make sure to use a gentle cycle. This will help to protect the fabric of the jersey while still allowing it to shrink.

<h2>Shrinking the Jersey</h2>

Once your jersey is pre-shrunk, it's time to shrink it further. Fill the washing machine with hot water and add a small amount of detergent. Place the jersey in the machine and set it to a hot wash. This will help to shrink the jersey further. 

Once the cycle is complete, remove the jersey from the machine and place it in the dryer. Set the dryer to the highest heat setting and let the jersey dry for about 20 minutes. This will give the jersey time to shrink further before it is finished. Once the 20 minutes is up, remove the jersey from the dryer and let it cool before wearing it.

<h2>Finishing the Job</h2>

Once the jersey is cool, it's time to finish the job. Take a few minutes to check the fit of the jersey and make sure that it fits properly. If it's still too big, you can repeat the shrinking process until it fits perfectly. If it's too small, you can try stretching it out a bit to make it more comfortable.
