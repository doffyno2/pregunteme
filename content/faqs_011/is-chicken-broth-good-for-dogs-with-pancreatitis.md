Pancreatitis is a common and potentially life-threatening condition in dogs. It’s an inflammation of the pancreas, which is an organ located near the stomach and intestines. The pancreas plays a key role in digestion and the production of hormones and enzymes. When the pancreas becomes inflamed, it can’t properly digest food and can cause serious health problems.

Pancreatitis can be caused by a number of factors including obesity, certain medications, infections, and even ingesting certain types of food. Treatment typically involves reducing inflammation and avoiding any foods that could further irritate the pancreas.

One of the most common questions pet owners have when it comes to pancreatitis is whether or not chicken broth is safe for their pup. The answer is yes, in most cases, chicken broth can be a beneficial part of a dog’s diet when they are suffering from pancreatitis.
