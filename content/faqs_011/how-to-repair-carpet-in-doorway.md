<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Subfloor</h3>

<p>The next step is to prepare the subfloor. Start by inspecting the subfloor for any damage or irregularities. If there are any holes or cracks, these should be filled with a patching compound.

Make sure you leave a few inches on each side of the doorway for the carpet to properly stretch. Once the carpet is cut, you can begin to install it. Start by applying a layer of carpet glue to the back of the carpet and then pressing it into place against the subfloor. Make sure the carpet is securely attached and then use a carpet stretcher to pull the carpet tight. Finally, use a carpet seam roller to press the seams into place.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Install a Tacking Strip</h3>

<p>To finish the installation, you will need to install a tacking strip along the edge of the doorway. Start by measuring the doorway and cutting the tacking strip to fit. Then, use a hammer to drive the nails into the subfloor and secure the tacking strip in place. Finally, use a carpet edge trim to cover the nail heads and finish the installation.</p>
