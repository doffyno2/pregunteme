<p>For many Cub Cadet riding mowers, the size of the battery needed to power the mower is determined by the type of mower and the engine size. Knowing the type of mower and engine size is the first step in determining the size of the battery needed for the mower to run.  </p>

The RZT S models also require a battery with a minimum RC of 80 minutes. </p>

<h2>Cub Cadet Z-Force S and SZ Lawn Mowers</h2>
