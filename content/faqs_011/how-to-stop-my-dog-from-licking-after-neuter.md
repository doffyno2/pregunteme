<p>Neutering your dog is a great way to help control the pet population, as well as reduce certain unwanted behaviors. However, one common side effect of neutering is that your pup may start licking at the incision site. This can be a frustrating behavior for pet owners, but luckily there are some steps you can take to help stop the licking and ensure your pet's incision heals properly. </p>

<h2>Understanding Why Dogs Lick After Neuter</h2>

<p>When a dog is neutered, they are given an anesthetic and then, depending on the procedure, either a small cut is made or the scrotum is removed. After surgery, pets may lick the incision site in an attempt to soothe themselves and relieve any itching or discomfort they may be feeling. In some cases, dogs may even try to remove stitches or other surgical materials from the incision site. </p>

<h2>Preventing Your Dog From Licking After Neuter</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent your dog from licking after a neuter is to make sure they are not able to reach the incision site. This can be done in several ways: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Put an Elizabethan collar, also known as an e-collar or cone, on your pup. This is a plastic or fabric cone-shaped device that fits around your dog’s neck and prevents them from reaching the incision site.</li>
  <li>Keep your pup in a separate room or area for a couple of days after the surgery, so they are unable to access the incision site.</li>
  <li>Make sure your pup is given plenty of attention and exercise, so they are not bored and trying to find something to do.</li>
  <li>Provide your pup with plenty of toys and chew bones to keep them occupied and distracted from the incision site.</li>
  <li>Check the incision site regularly for any signs of infection or irritation, and contact your veterinarian if you have any concerns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Worry About Your Dog Licking After Neuter</h2>

<p>If you notice your pup licking excessively at the incision site, it is important to monitor the area closely and contact your veterinarian if you have any concerns. Excessive licking can cause the wound to open or become infected, so it is important to take action as soon as possible. </p>

<h2>Things to Avoid After Neuter</h2>

<p>It is important to avoid certain activities and behaviors after your pup has been neutered. These include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid letting your pup run and play too soon after the surgery. Your pup should take it easy for at least two weeks.</li>
  <li>Avoid taking your pup for any long walks or hikes for at least two weeks after the surgery.</li>
  <li>Avoid bathing your pup for at least two weeks after the surgery.</li>
  <li>Avoid allowing your pup to swim for at least two weeks after the surgery.</li>
