Will a Male Dog Have Sex With Another Male Dog?



As a pet owner, one of your biggest concerns is ensuring the safety and well-being of your beloved fur babies. That includes understanding their behaviors and being aware of any potential risks they may encounter.

One behavior you may be curious about is whether your male dog may attempt to have sex with another male dog. Let’s take a look at some of the facts surrounding male-on-male canine sexuality.

<h2>What’s Behind Male-on-Male Canine Sexuality?</h2>

Male-on-male canine sexuality is a natural phenomenon. While it’s not as common as heterosexual canine relationships, it does occur. This behavior is often seen in younger, unneutered male dogs, but it can also occur in older, neutered male dogs.

There are a few potential explanations for why male-on-male canine sexuality occurs. One explanation is that it’s an instinctual behavior that helps dogs establish their dominance over other males. This is especially true if the dog is unneutered, as testosterone can cause aggressive behavior.

Another explanation is that the behavior is a result of frustration. Male dogs may become frustrated if they are unable to find a female mate, so they may turn to other males as an outlet.

<h2>What Are the Risks of Male-on-Male Canine Sexuality?</h2>

Male-on-male canine sexuality can be dangerous for a number of reasons. Injuries can occur if the dogs are not properly supervised. Additionally, sexually-transmitted diseases can be spread between male dogs.

It’s also important to note that male dogs who engage in male-on-male canine sexuality may be more likely to engage in other risky behaviors. For example, they may be more likely to roam, fight, and mark their territory.

• Excessive licking of another male dog’s genitals
• Aggressive behavior toward other male dogs

• Marking their territory more than usual

<h2>What Should You Do if Your Male Dog Is Engaging in Male-on-Male Canine Sexuality?</h2>
