<p>Baseball bats come in many different sizes and materials, so it can be difficult to decide which one is right for you. One decision you'll need to make is whether to buy a bat that's labeled BBCOR or USSSA. In this article, we'll explain the differences between these two types of bats, so you can make the best decision for your needs.</p>

<h2>What is BBCOR?</h2>

<p>BBCOR stands for "Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitution." It's an industry standard certification that ensures a bat is safe for use in high school and collegiate play. All BBCOR bats must bear the BBCOR label on them. The BBCOR label is usually found on the taper of the bat, near the knob. </p>

<h2>What is USSSA?</h2>

<p>USSSA stands for the United States Specialty Sports Association. It's a governing body of youth baseball that sets standards for bats and other equipment used in play. All bats that are approved for USSSA play must bear the USSSA stamp. </p>

<h2>What Are The Differences Between BBCOR and USSSA Bats?</h2>

<p>BBCOR bats are heavier than USSSA bats. This is because BBCOR bats need to meet stricter standards for safety. BBCOR bats are also made of a harder material than USSSA bats, which helps keep the ball from traveling too far. </p>

<p>USSSA bats are lighter than BBCOR bats and made of a softer material. This makes them more suitable for younger players who don't have as much experience with the game. USSSA bats also have larger sweet spots than BBCOR bats, which makes them easier to hit with. </p>

<h2>Which Bat Should I Use?</h2>

<p>The type of bat you should use depends on your age and skill level. BBCOR bats are best for high school and collegiate players who have strong fundamentals and can make solid contact with the ball. BBCOR bats are also the only type of bat that can be used in high school and collegiate play. </p>

<p>USSSA bats are best for younger players who are just starting out with the game. The lighter weight and larger sweet spot makes them easier to swing and hit with. However, USSSA bats are not allowed in high school and collegiate play. </p>
