<p>Chimineas are outdoor fireplaces that have become popular in recent years. They provide a beautiful ambiance and create a warm, inviting atmosphere in a backyard or outdoor space. Unfortunately, chimineas are prone to cracks due to the heat of the fire and the thin walls of the fireplace. If you have a cracked chiminea, you may be wondering how to repair it.
