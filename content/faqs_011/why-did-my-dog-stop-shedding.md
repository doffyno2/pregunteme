When it comes to owning a pet, there is nothing quite like having a furry friend to come home to. Dogs are among the most popular pets – they’re loyal, loving, and just plain cute. But as much as we love our canine friends, there is one part of owning a dog that many people dread – shedding. 

While all dogs shed to some degree, some breeds seem to shed more than others. Shedding is a natural process for dogs and is part of the normal cycle of hair growth. But when your furry friend suddenly stops shedding, it can be worrisome. So what could be causing your dog to stop shedding? 

<h2>The Basics of Shedding</h2>

Shedding is the process of old, dead fur being replaced by new fur. Dogs typically shed their coat twice a year, although some breeds such as retrievers or collies may shed more often. During these shedding periods, you may notice extra hair around your home, on your furniture, and maybe even on your clothes. 

But your dog’s shedding should not be excessive. If your pup seems to be shedding an abnormal amount of fur, it could be a sign of an underlying health issue. 

<h2>When Shedding Stops Unexpectedly</h2>

If your pup has suddenly stopped shedding, it could be due to a number of different factors. First, check to see if the weather has changed. If it has been colder or warmer than usual, your pup might be responding to the temperature change. 

It could also be due to changes in your pup’s diet. If you have recently changed his food, this could be a factor. Try going back to the old food to see if the shedding returns.

<h2>Health Issues That Can Cause Shedding to Stop</h2>

If your pup’s diet and the weather have stayed the same, then it could be due to a health issue. Here are some common medical issues that can cause shedding to stop: 

<h3>Allergies</h3>

Just like humans, dogs can suffer from allergies. Allergies can cause a dog to stop shedding, as well as other symptoms such as excessive scratching, licking, or chewing. If your pup is exhibiting any of these signs, take him to the vet for a checkup. 

<h3>Skin Infections</h3>

Another common cause of shedding is skin infections. Bacterial or fungal infections can cause your pup’s fur to stop growing and can also cause excessive itching. If your pup is exhibiting these symptoms, take him to the vet for a diagnosis and treatment. 

<h3>Stress</h3>

Stress can also cause shedding to stop. If your pup is stressed or anxious, he may be experiencing a condition known as Alopecia X, which is caused by a hormonal imbalance. Take your pup to the vet to get a diagnosis and treatment. 

<h3>Hormonal Imbalances</h3>

Hormonal imbalances can also cause shedding to stop. Conditions such as hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease, and diabetes can all cause shedding to stop. If you suspect your pup has any of these conditions, take him to the vet for a diagnosis and treatment. 

<h2>What to Do if Your Dog Stops Shedding</h2>

If your pup has suddenly stopped shedding and you can’t find an obvious cause, take him to the vet for a checkup. Your vet can examine your pup and run tests to determine what is causing the shedding to stop. 

In the meantime, you can help keep your pup’s fur healthy by regularly brushing and combing it. This will help remove any dead fur and stimulate the skin and hair follicles. You can also use a mild shampoo that is specifically designed for dogs.
