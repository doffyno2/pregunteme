<p>An e-collar, also known as an electric collar, remote collar, or shock collar, is a device that is used to train and control dogs from a distance. It is a common training aid used by professional dog trainers, as well as pet owners, to help teach their dog commands and control bad behaviors. The e-collar works by sending a mild electric shock, sound, vibration, or spray to the dog when it does not obey a command, or when it exhibits unwanted behavior. While the use of an e-collar is controversial, it can be an effective tool when used correctly and humanely. In this article, we'll explain how to put an e-collar on a dog and the steps to take to ensure your pup is properly trained with an e-collar.</p>

<h2>What Is an E Collar?</h2>

<p>An e-collar is a tool used to train and control a dog’s behavior from a distance. It is typically used to help train a dog to respond to commands, such as “sit” or “stay”, and to discourage unwanted behaviors, such as barking or jumping on people. The collar works by sending a mild electric shock, sound, vibration, or spray to the dog when it does not obey a command, or when it exhibits unwanted behavior. The shock is meant to be a mild deterrent that gets the dog’s attention and makes it easier for the dog to learn the desired behavior. This type of collar has been known to be effective in training dogs, but it is also controversial due to concerns about its use.</p>

<h2>Types of E Collars</h2>

<p>There are several different types of e-collars on the market, and each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most commonly used types are remote e-collars and spray e-collars. Remote e-collars use a remote control to send a mild electric shock to the collar when the dog does not obey a command or exhibits unwanted behavior. Spray e-collars use a spray canister filled with a mild citronella spray or water to get the dog’s attention and make it easier to train the desired behavior. Some collars also feature a beeping sound or vibration to help get the dog’s attention.</p>

<h2>How to Put an E Collar on a Dog</h2>

<p>Putting an e-collar on a dog is relatively simple, but there are a few steps you should take to ensure the collar is fitted correctly and that your pup is comfortable wearing it. Here’s what you need to do:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Measure Your Dog’s Neck</h3>

<p>Before you buy an e-collar, you need to measure your pup’s neck to make sure you get the right size. To do this, use a soft measuring tape and measure around the widest part of your pup’s neck. Make sure the collar is not too tight or too loose. Most e-collars come in sizes from small to extra-large, so be sure to choose the right size for your pup.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Fit the Collar</h3>

<p>Once you have the right size e-collar, you can fit it to your pup. Start by placing the collar around your pup’s neck and adjusting the fit so that it is snug but not too tight. Ensure the collar is not too close to the neck, as this can cause discomfort. Make sure the collar is not too loose either, as this could cause it to slip off.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Attach the Receiver</h3>

<p>Once you have fitted the collar, you need to attach the receiver. This is the part of the collar that will receive the signal from the remote control. Make sure the receiver is securely attached to the collar and that it is in the right position. The receiver should be positioned in the middle of the collar and not too close to the neck.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Test the Collar</h3>

<p>Once the receiver is attached, you need to test the collar. To test the collar, use the remote control to send a signal to the receiver. If the collar responds and emits a sound or vibration, then the collar is working properly and you can move on to training your pup with the collar.</p>

<h2>Tips for Training with an E Collar</h2>

<p>Once you have put the e-collar on your pup and tested it, you can begin to train your pup with the collar. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your e-collar training:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with a low setting – It’s important to start with a low setting on the collar and work your way up slowly. This will help ensure your pup is not startled or scared by the collar.</li>
<li>Use positive reinforcement – It’s important to use positive reinforcement when training with an e-collar. This means rewarding your pup with treats or praise when they obey a command or exhibit desired behavior.</li>
<li>Be consistent – Consistency is key when it comes to training with an e-collar. Make sure you are consistent in your commands and that you are using the collar correctly.</li>
<li>Be patient – Training with an e-collar can take time, so it’s important to be patient. Don’t expect to see results overnight, and be sure to take breaks if your pup gets overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
