<h2>Introduction</h2>

Making a paper knife is a great craft project that can be done in a few minutes with just a few simple materials. It's a great way to add a unique and personal touch to your desk, and the finished product can be used for a variety of tasks. Whether you're looking to add a unique touch to your office or just want a fun project to do with your kids, making a paper knife is a great way to do it.

<h2>Materials Needed</h2>

Before you start, make sure you have all the materials you need. You'll need a piece of cardboard, scissors, glue, a ruler, and a pencil. You can also use a craft knife or a utility knife if you want to, but it isn't necessary. Once you have all your materials ready, you can move on to the next step.

<h2>Step 1: Cut Out the Cardboard</h2>

Using your ruler and pencil, measure out a piece of cardboard to the size and shape you want your paper knife to be. You can make it any size you want, but it should be at least 6 inches long and 1 inch wide. Once you have your measurements, use your scissors to cut out the cardboard.

<h2>Step 2: Make the Handle</h2>

Now that you have your cardboard cut to the size you want, it's time to make the handle. To do this, use your ruler and pencil to measure and mark off a 2-inch section of the cardboard. Once you have your measurements, use your scissors to cut out the section. This will be the handle of your paper knife.

<h2>Step 3: Glue the Handle</h2>

Now it's time to glue the handle onto the cardboard. Take your glue and spread a thin layer on the back of the handle. Then carefully place it onto the cardboard, making sure to line up the edges. Once you have the handle in place, press down firmly to make sure it is securely attached.

<h2>Step 4: Cut Out the Blade</h2>

Now that you have your handle in place, it's time to cut out the blade of your paper knife. To do this, use your ruler and pencil to measure and mark off a 2-inch section of the cardboard. Once you have your measurements, use your scissors to cut out the section. This will be the blade of your paper knife.

<h2>Step 5: Sharpen the Blade</h2>

Now that you have cut out the blade of your paper knife, it's time to sharpen it. To do this, use a craft knife or a utility knife to carefully sharpen the edges of the blade. Make sure to be very careful while doing this, as it can be dangerous. Once you have sharpened the blade, you can move on to the next step.

<h2>Step 6: Glue the Blade</h2>

Now it's time to glue the blade onto the cardboard. Take your glue and spread a thin layer on the back of the blade. Then carefully place it onto the cardboard, making sure to line up the edges with the handle. Once you have the blade in place, press down firmly to make sure it is securely attached.

<h2>Step 7: Finishing Touches</h2>

Now that you have your paper knife assembled, it's time to add the finishing touches. If you want, you can add some decorations or designs to the handle or the blade. You can also use a craft knife or a utility knife to make any other adjustments you want to make. Once you're happy with how it looks, your paper knife is ready to use!
