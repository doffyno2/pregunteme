It’s natural for us to be concerned when our beloved pet is displaying behavior that we don’t understand. We want to make sure that our pet is safe and healthy, and any type of odd behavior can be concerning. One behavior that has puzzled many dog owners is when their dog licks the eyes of another dog. This behavior can be concerning for a variety of reasons and can even appear to be aggressive. So why does a dog lick another dog’s eyes?

<h2>What Does it Mean When a Dog Licks Another Dog's Eyes?</h2>

There are a few different explanations for why a dog might lick another dog's eyes. One of the most common reasons is that the dog is trying to show affection. Dogs often lick each other’s faces as a way to show affection and share a bond with one another. If your dog is licking the eyes of another dog, it could just be a sign that they are enjoying each other’s company and expressing their love for one another.

Another explanation could be that the dog is trying to give the other dog comfort. If a dog is feeling scared or anxious, licking the eyes of another dog can be comforting and soothing. The physical contact and the act of grooming can be calming for both dogs and help them to feel secure.

It’s also possible that the dog is trying to show submission to the other dog. If a dog is feeling intimidated or uncertain, licking the eyes of another dog can be a sign of submission. This type of behavior is often seen in puppies who are trying to show deference to an older dog.
