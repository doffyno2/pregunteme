<p>RAD stands for Racing And Drifting, and is a popular style of bike racing and bike drifting that has been gaining in popularity over the last several years. This style of racing is all about speed, agility, and precision, and the bikes used in RAD are designed to provide riders with the tools they need to achieve their racing goals. The bikes used in RAD have been specifically designed to provide superior speed, maneuverability, and acceleration in order to help riders achieve their top speeds and drift angles. Let’s take a look at some of the bikes used in RAD and what makes them so special.</p>

<h2>A Brief History of RAD</h2>

<p>The first recorded RAD event was held in 1995 in Tokyo, Japan. The event was created by a group of Japanese street racers and the event quickly gained in popularity. The event soon spread around the world and RAD events are now held in countries such as the United States, Australia, and Europe. The popularity of the event has led to an increase in the number of people participating in RAD, and the number of bikes used in the event has grown exponentially.</p>

<h2>The Different Types of Bikes Used in RAD</h2>

<p>The bikes used in RAD are divided into two main categories: dedicated race bikes and drifters. The dedicated race bikes are designed to provide superior speed, acceleration, and maneuverability in order to help riders achieve their top speeds. These bikes are usually equipped with powerful engines and lightweight frames in order to help the rider reach their top speed and drift angles. On the other hand, drifters are designed to provide superior maneuverability and acceleration in order to help the rider reach their top drift angle.</p>

<h2>Types of Dedicated Race Bikes Used in RAD</h2>

<p>The most popular type of bike used in RAD is the sport bike. These bikes are designed to provide superior speed and maneuverability in order to help riders achieve their top speeds and drift angles. Sport bikes are usually equipped with powerful engines and lightweight frames in order to help the rider reach their top speed and drift angles. Additionally, sport bikes are usually equipped with aerodynamic fairings and body kits in order to reduce drag and help the rider achieve their top speed.</p>

<p>Another popular type of bike used in RAD is the supermoto bike. These bikes are designed to provide superior maneuverability and acceleration in order to help riders achieve their top drift angle. Supermoto bikes are usually equipped with powerful engines and lightweight frames in order to help the rider reach their top drift angle. Additionally, these bikes are usually equipped with large tires and wide handlebars in order to help the rider achieve their top drift angle.</p>

<h2>Types of Drifters Used in RAD</h2>

<p>The most popular type of drifter used in RAD is the dirt bike. These bikes are designed to provide superior acceleration and maneuverability in order to help riders achieve their top drift angle. Dirt bikes are usually equipped with powerful engines and lightweight frames in order to help the rider reach their top drift angle. Additionally, dirt bikes are usually equipped with large tires and wide handlebars in order to help the rider achieve their top drift angle.</p>

<p>Another popular type of drifter used in RAD is the dual-sport bike. These bikes are designed to provide superior speed and maneuverability in order to help riders achieve their top drift angle. Dual-sport bikes are usually equipped with powerful engines and lightweight frames in order to help the rider reach their top drift angle. Additionally, dual-sport bikes are usually equipped with large tires and wide handlebars in order to help the rider achieve their top drift angle.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The bikes used in RAD have been designed specifically for the purpose of providing riders with the tools they need to achieve their top speeds and drift angles. The different types of bikes used in RAD have been designed to provide superior speed, acceleration, and maneuverability in order to help riders achieve their top speeds and drift angles. Whether you’re a dedicated racer or a drifter, the bikes used in RAD will help you achieve your goal.</p>
