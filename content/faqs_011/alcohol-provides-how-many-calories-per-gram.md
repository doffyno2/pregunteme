<p>Alcohol is a source of calories, but it's not always clear just how many calories you're consuming when you drink. Alcohol provides seven calories per gram, which is more than carbohydrates and protein, but fewer than fat. Those calories can add up quickly, so it's important to track your intake when you're trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy diet.</p>

<h2>How Many Calories Does Alcohol Contain?</h2>

<p>Alcohol is a macronutrient, just like carbohydrates, protein, and fat. It contains seven calories per gram, which is more than carbohydrates and protein, but fewer than fat. That means that a 12-ounce beer, which contains about 5% alcohol, contains about 85 calories from alcohol alone.</p>

<p>When it comes to other alcoholic beverages, the calorie content will vary depending on the type and serving size. For instance, a 4-ounce glass of wine contains about 85 calories, while a 1.5-ounce shot of whiskey contains about 105 calories. Mixed drinks can contain even more calories, depending on the ingredients used.</p>

<h2>Alcohol and Weight Loss</h2>

<p>Consuming alcohol can make it more difficult to lose weight. Alcoholic beverages are high in both calories and sugar, which can lead to weight gain if consumed in excess. Additionally, alcohol can interfere with the body's ability to metabolize fat, which can make it harder to shed excess pounds.</p>

<p>Furthermore, drinking can lead to overeating, as alcohol can impair judgement and increase cravings for unhealthy foods. For these reasons, it's best to limit your alcohol intake if you're trying to lose weight.</p>

<h2>How to Limit Your Alcohol Intake</h2>

<p>If you're trying to limit your alcohol intake, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure to track your alcohol consumption and stay mindful of how many calories you're consuming. Secondly, try to opt for lower-calorie options like light beers and wine spritzers. Finally, alternate alcoholic beverages with water or soda water to stay hydrated and cut down on calories.</p>

<h2>Alcohol and Health Benefits</h2>

<p>Despite its high calorie content, alcohol can also have some health benefits. Studies have found that moderate alcohol consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Additionally, alcohol can increase levels of HDL (the "good" cholesterol) and reduce inflammation.</p>

<p>However, any potential health benefits of alcohol must be weighed against the risks of excessive drinking. Heavy alcohol consumption can increase the risk of certain cancers and can cause liver damage.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Alcohol provides seven calories per gram, which can quickly add up. If you're trying to lose weight, it's best to limit your alcohol intake. However, moderate drinking may also have some health benefits.</p>
