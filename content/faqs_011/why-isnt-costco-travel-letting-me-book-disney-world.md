<p>If you’re a savvy traveler, you’ve probably heard of Costco Travel. It’s a one-stop shop for all things related to planning your next vacation. You can book flights, hotels, car rentals, and more. So, why isn’t Costco Travel letting you book Disney World?</p>

<p>The answer is simple: Disney World doesn’t allow third-party vendors to book their tickets. That means you can’t use Costco Travel, Expedia, or any other third-party vendor to purchase tickets to Disney World. Instead, you’ll have to purchase your tickets directly through Disney.</p>

<p>The good news is that Disney does offer some discounts and promotions when you purchase tickets directly through their website. You can find discounts for Florida residents, military personnel, and more. Additionally, Disney offers a variety of packages that can save you money on airfare, hotel stays, and park tickets.</p>

<p>That said, there are a few ways to get discounts on tickets to Disney World, even if you can’t use Costco Travel. For starters, you can purchase discounted “multi-day” passes. These passes are good for two days or more, and they come with discounts on tickets, food, and souvenirs. Additionally, you can purchase tickets from local ticket resellers. These resellers often offer discounted tickets, but you’ll have to purchase them in person.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an even better deal, you can purchase tickets through a package deal. Many travel websites offer packages that include flights, hotel stays, and tickets to Disney World. These packages can save you up to 50% off the cost of purchasing the items separately. Additionally, many of these packages come with bonus perks like free meals and early access to the parks.</p>

<p>No matter how you get your tickets, you’ll still have to purchase them directly from Disney. That means you won’t be able to use Costco Travel to book your Disney World vacation. However, there are still plenty of ways to save money on your trip to the “Happiest Place on Earth.”</p>
