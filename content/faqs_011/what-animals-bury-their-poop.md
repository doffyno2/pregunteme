Poop is a fact of life and animals, like humans, have to deal with it. Although humans can use toilets or other methods to dispose of their waste, animals have to rely on nature to take care of their waste. Some animals bury their poop, while others just leave it in the open. This article will discuss some of the animals that bury their poop and why they do it. 

<h2>Why Some Animals Bury Their Poop</h2>

Many animals bury their poop as a way to mark their territory and to keep predators away. By burying their poop, animals can create a scent barrier around their territory that predators can detect, warning them to stay away. This behavior is especially common in animals that live in packs, such as wolves and coyotes, as the scent barrier helps to keep the pack together and safe from predators. 

In addition to marking territory, some animals bury their poop as a way to protect their food sources. By burying their waste, animals can prevent other animals from getting to their food and eating it. This is especially important for animals that live in areas where food is scarce and they must protect what they have. 

Finally, some animals bury their poop as a way to keep the environment clean. By burying their waste, animals can prevent it from polluting the area and causing an unpleasant odor. This behavior is especially important in animals that live close to humans, as they must keep their area clean to avoid conflicts with people.
