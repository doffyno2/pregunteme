<p>Traveling to other countries with a felony can be a tricky and complicated process. Depending on the severity of the crime and the country you wish to visit, you may or may not be able to obtain a visa. In some cases, a visa application may be denied due to a criminal history. However, there are some countries that are more lenient when it comes to felons traveling within their borders. Here is an overview of the countries you can travel to with a felony.</p>
