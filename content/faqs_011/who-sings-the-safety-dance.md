Say, we can go where we want to<br>
A place where they will never find<br>
And we can act like we come from out of this world<br>
Leave the real one far behind<br>
And we can dance<br>
We can dance<br>
Everything's out of control<br>
We can dance<br>
We can dance<br>
We're doing it from wall to wall<br>
We can dance, we can dance<br>
Everybody look at your hands<br>
We can dance, we can dance<br>
Everybody take a chance<br>
We can dance, we can dance<br>
Everybody's doing it<br>
Do the safety dance"</p>
