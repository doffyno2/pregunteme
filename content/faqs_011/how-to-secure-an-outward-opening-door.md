<p>Having an outward opening door in your home can be both very convenient and very risky at the same time. On the one hand, outward opening doors can save you time and effort when you're in a hurry, as they are much easier to open and close. On the other hand, they can also be a security risk, as any intruder can easily gain entry to your home. So, how can you make sure your outward opening door is secure and that any intruder is kept out? Read on for our top tips.</p>

<h2>Choose a Secure Door</h2>

<p>First and foremost, the type of door you choose will play a major role in ensuring your home is secure. If youâ€™re in the market for a new door, make sure you select one with a robust frame and an anti-snap lock. The frame should be made from a strong, durable material such as steel or hardwood, while the lock should be designed to resist any attempts to break in. This will dramatically reduce the chances of an intruder being able to gain entry to your home.</p>

<h2>Fit a Deadlock</h2>

<p>If you already have an outward opening door installed, you can still make sure it is secure. Fitting a deadlock is one of the best ways to do this. Deadlocks are designed to securely lock your door from the inside, meaning any intruder will be unable to get in. You can also fit a deadbolt for extra security and to make it even more difficult for an intruder to gain access to your home.</p>

<h2>Install a Peephole</h2>

<p>Another great way to secure an outward opening door is to install a peephole. This will allow you to see who is at the door before you open it, giving you the chance to check who they are and whether they are a threat or not. You can also fit a door chain, which will allow you to open the door a small amount to speak to the person without allowing them to gain entry to your home.</p>

<h2>Install Additional Security</h2>

<p>Finally, you may want to consider installing additional security features. These can include CCTV cameras, motion-sensor lights, and even security alarms. All of these features can help to deter any intruder, making it even less likely that they will be able to gain entry to your home.</p>
