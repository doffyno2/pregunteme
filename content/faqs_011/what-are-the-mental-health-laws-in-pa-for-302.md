<p>Mental health laws in Pennsylvania are designed to protect the health and safety of those suffering from mental illness, as well as the general public. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has established a variety of laws and regulations to ensure that individuals with mental health issues receive proper care and treatment. The laws governing mental health in Pennsylvania are known as the Mental Health Procedures Act (MHPA) and the Mental Health and Intellectual Disability Code (MHIDC).</p>

<p>The MHPA was enacted in 1976 and is the primary law governing mental health in Pennsylvania. The MHPA sets forth procedures for the evaluation, treatment, and release of individuals with mental illness, including the right to an independent evaluation, the right to refuse treatment, and the right to be discharged from a facility if the individual is found to be competent. The MHPA also sets forth standards for the delivery of services to individuals with mental illness, including the rights of individuals to receive appropriate treatment, to be informed of their rights, and to be informed of the available treatment options and their associated costs.</p>

<p>The MHIDC was enacted in 1990 and is the primary law governing intellectual disability in Pennsylvania. The MHIDC sets forth the procedures for the evaluation, treatment, and release of individuals with intellectual disability, including the right to an independent evaluation, the right to refuse treatment, and the right to be discharged from a facility if the individual is found to be competent. The MHIDC also sets forth standards for the delivery of services to individuals with intellectual disability, including the rights of individuals to receive appropriate treatment, to be informed of their rights, and to be informed of the available treatment options and their associated costs.</p>

<p>The Mental Health and Intellectual Disability Code defines "302" as "voluntary admission to a public or private mental health facility for purposes of treatment or evaluation." Under the MHIDC, individuals can voluntarily admit themselves to a mental health facility for evaluation or treatment. The individual's doctor or a mental health professional must approve the voluntary admission and must provide the individual with a written statement outlining the reasons for the admission. The individual must sign the statement of voluntary admission and must be informed of the rights that are associated with being a voluntary patient.</p>

<p>Under the Mental Health and Intellectual Disability Code, individuals can also be admitted to a mental health facility involuntarily. This type of admission is known as a "302 commitment" and is typically requested by a family member or legal representative on behalf of the individual. To be admitted involuntarily, the individual must meet certain criteria, including being a danger to themselves or others, being unable to provide for their own care, or being a danger to the community. The request for involuntary admission must be approved by a court and the individual must be informed of their rights prior to admission.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, mental health professionals must follow certain guidelines when dealing with individuals under 302 commitments. These guidelines are designed to ensure that individuals are treated with respect, dignity, and compassion, and to ensure that their rights are not violated. Mental health professionals must also ensure that individuals under 302 commitments receive appropriate and adequate mental health care. Treatment must be individualized to meet the needs of the individual and must be provided in a safe and secure environment.</p>

<p>The Mental Health and Intellectual Disability Code also sets forth the rights of individuals under 302 commitments. These rights include the right to receive appropriate mental health care, the right to refuse treatment, and the right to be informed of their rights and the available treatment options and their associated costs. Additionally, individuals under 302 commitments have the right to an independent evaluation and to be discharged from a facility if they are found to be competent.</p>
