<p>Men’s feet usually stop growing in their late teens or early twenties. The exact age varies from person to person, but most men are done growing by the age of 21. After the age of 21, the feet may still change shape slightly as the ligaments and tendons become more flexible. However, the bones will not grow any longer.</p>

<h2>What Factors Affect Foot Growth?</h2>

<p>Several factors can affect foot growth in men. The most influential factor is genetics. If you have a family history of larger feet, it’s likely that you will also have larger feet. During adolescence, rapid growth spurts can also cause feet to grow faster than normal. Diet and nutrition also play a role, as a healthy diet will promote proper bone and tissue formation.</p>

<h2>How Can I Tell When My Feet Are Done Growing?</h2>

<p>The best way to tell when your feet are done growing is to monitor your shoe size.

Once your feet stop growing, your shoe size should remain relatively consistent.</p>

<h2>Can I Make My Feet Grow Longer?</h2>
