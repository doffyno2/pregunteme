<p>Having an active and playful pup can make having a comfortable bed for them impossible. Chewing, biting and scratching can quickly turn a plush and comfortable bed into a pile of stuffing and fabric. If you have an active pup, you need to invest in a chew proof dog bed. Follow these steps to make a chew proof dog bed that will last longer and keep your pup comfortable.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Choose a Durable Fabric</h2>

<p>The fabric of the bed is the first building block in making a chew proof bed. Choose a fabric that is thick, durable and also comfortable for your pup. For example, oxford cloth is strong and lightweight so it is great for a chew proof bed. Denim is also an excellent choice for a chew proof bed. It is thick, heavy and long-lasting. However, be aware that denim can be a bit stiff, so it is best to choose a softer denim or a denim blend. If you're looking for something that is waterproof and chew proof, you can opt for a vinyl or leather fabric. Vinyl is waterproof, easy to clean and comes in a variety of colors and textures. Leather is luxurious and also very durable, but can be expensive. When choosing a fabric, look for one that is thick, durable, comfortable and waterproof.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Add a Lining Layer</h2>

<p>Adding a lining layer to the bed will help increase the durability of the bed. This layer can be a waterproof material such as vinyl or a heavy duty fabric such as canvas. The lining layer will help protect the bed from moisture and also make it more difficult for your pup to chew through. You can also opt to use a heavy duty fabric such as canvas or denim as the lining layer. This will help to add another layer of protection and make the bed even more chew proof.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Use Sturdy Thread</h2>

<p>When sewing the bed together, make sure to use a heavy duty thread that is designed for upholstery or other heavy fabrics. This will help ensure that the seams are strong and will not easily tear or come apart. You can also opt to use a thread that is designed to be resistant to chewing and other destructive behaviors. This type of thread is often used for pet beds and will help to keep your pup from being able to chew through the fabric.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Reinforce the Seams</h2>

<p>Reinforcing the seams of the bed is an important step in making a chew proof bed. You can use a heavy duty fabric such as canvas or a thick vinyl to reinforce the seams. This will help to make the bed even more durable and also make it more difficult for your pup to chew through. You can also use a heavy duty thread to sew the seams together. This will help to ensure that the seams are strong and will not easily come apart.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Cover the Bed With a Protective Layer</h2>

<p>Once you have sewn the bed together, you can add a layer of protection to it. This can be a waterproof cover or a heavy duty fabric such as canvas or denim. This will help to make the bed even more chew proof and also protect it from moisture. You can also opt to use a bed liner such as a nylon or canvas cover. This will help to protect the bed from dirt, debris and other destructive behaviors.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Add a Comfort Layer</h2>

<p>Finally, you can add a comfort layer to the bed. This can be a thick and plush layer of padding or a memory foam mattress.
