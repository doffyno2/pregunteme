<h2>What Causes Dogs to Pee in the House?</h2>

Before looking at how essential oils can be used to stop a dog from peeing in the house, it is important to understand why dogs pee in the house in the first place. The most common reason is that the dog is not properly housetrained. Dogs are creatures of habit and if they are not taught from a young age that peeing in the house is not acceptable, it can become a habit. Other reasons why a dog might pee in the house include anxiety, fear, marking territory, or medical issues such as a urinary tract infection. 

<h2>How Essential Oils Can Help Stop a Dog From Peeing in the House</h2>

Essential oils can be used to stop a dog from peeing in the house in several ways. The first is by using the essential oil as a deterrent. If a dog smells a scent that it does not like, it will be less likely to pee in the area where the scent is present. The second way that essential oils can help is by calming the dog. If a dog is anxious or fearful, it is more likely to pee in the house. Essential oils can help to relax the dog and reduce its anxiety. 

<h2>Which Essential Oils Should Be Used?</h2>

The best essential oils for keeping dogs from peeing in the house are citronella, eucalyptus, lavender, and tea tree oil.

<h2>How to Use Essential Oils to Keep Dogs From Peeing in the House</h2>

The most common way is to mix a few drops of the essential oil with water in a spray bottle and spray it in the areas where the dog has been peeing. The spray should be reapplied every few days until the dog stops peeing in the house. Essential oils can also be used in diffusers to spread the scent throughout the house. Finally, essential oils can be added to a dog's shampoo or collar to help keep them from peeing in the house.
