<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Removing a microwave over a stove is a tricky task, and it's important to take the necessary precautions to ensure that you don't injure yourself or damage your kitchen in the process. Before you start, make sure you have all the tools you need to complete the job. This includes a screwdriver, pliers, a hammer, and a level. 

<h2>Step 1: Unplug the Microwave</h2>

The first step in removing a microwave over a stove is to unplug it. Make sure you do this before you begin any other steps. This will prevent you from getting an electric shock.

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Mounting Screws</h2>

The next step is to remove the mounting screws that hold the microwave in place. The screws are usually located at the back of the microwave. If you can't find them, you may need to unscrew the plate on the top of the microwave. Once you've located the screws, use a screwdriver to remove them.

<h2>Step 3: Remove the Ventilation Ducts</h2>

The next step is to remove the ventilation ducts. The ducts are usually located at the back of the microwave. Use a pair of pliers to remove the screws that hold them in place. Once the screws are removed, you can pull the ducts off.

<h2>Step 4: Remove the Microwave</h2>

Once the mounting screws and ducts are removed, you can now begin to remove the microwave from the wall. Start by lifting the microwave from the wall. This can be a bit tricky, so it's important to use caution. Once the microwave is free from the wall, you can move it to a safe place.

<h2>Step 5: Install the New Microwave</h2>

If you're installing a new microwave, the first step is to make sure it fits in the space. Use a level to make sure the microwave is level. Once the microwave is level, you can begin installing the mounting screws. Start by securing the top screws first, then the bottom screws. Make sure the screws are tight. 

<h2>Step 6: Install the Ventilation Ducts</h2>

Once the mounting screws are in place, you can now install the ventilation ducts. Use a pair of pliers to secure the screws that hold the ducts in place. Make sure the screws are tight to ensure the ducts are securely in place. 

<h2>Step 7: Plug in the Microwave</h2>

The final step is to plug in the microwave. Make sure the plug is securely plugged in and the power switch is in the off position. Once the microwave is plugged in, you can turn it on and start using it.
