What Does Glove Oil Do?

Glove oil is an essential ingredient in any leather-working project. Whether used in the manufacture of gloves, boots, bags, saddles, or other leather goods, it’s an invaluable resource for getting the job done. But what does glove oil do, exactly? And why is it so important for leatherworking? In this article, we’ll explore the many uses and benefits of glove oil and how it can be used to make a variety of leather products.



Glove oil is a special type of oil made from tallow or fish oil, which is a type of animal fat. It’s often used in the tanning process for leather products, and it helps to create a flexible and water-resistant finish. Glove oil is also used to waterproof leather and protect it from the elements. It’s an essential part of the leather-working process, as it helps to preserve the leather and keep it looking its best.



Glove oil is a very versatile product, and it can be used for a variety of purposes. The primary use of glove oil is to waterproof and protect leather products. It helps to make them more resistant to water and other elements, and it also helps to preserve the leather and keep it in good condition.

Glove oil also helps to make leather products more flexible. It can be used to lubricate joints and seams, which helps to make them more durable and less prone to wear and tear. It also helps to prevent cracking and splitting, which can occur over time with exposure to the elements.

Finally, glove oil is also used to give leather products a unique and attractive finish. It can be used to create a glossy or matte finish, which helps to give the leather an attractive sheen. It’s also often used to darken the color of the leather and give it a more luxurious look.



Using glove oil is relatively straightforward. The first step is to apply the oil to the leather product, either with a brush or by rubbing it in directly. It’s important to use a light, even coat of oil, as too much can cause the leather to become too soft or too greasy.

Once the oil has been applied, it’s important to let it soak in for several hours. After this, the leather should be buffed with a soft cloth. This will help to remove any excess oil and ensure that the leather has absorbed the oil evenly.



Using glove oil has a number of benefits. As mentioned above, it helps to waterproof and protect leather products, making them more resistant to water and other elements. It also helps to make the leather more flexible, which makes it less prone to cracking and splitting. Finally, it can also be used to give the leather a unique and attractive finish.
