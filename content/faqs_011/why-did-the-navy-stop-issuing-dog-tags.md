<p>The Navy has been issuing dog tags to personnel since the early 1900s, but they've recently stopped. This has left many wondering why, and this article will answer that question. We'll look at the history of dog tags, how they were used by the Navy, and why they are no longer issued.</p>

<h2>What are Dog Tags?</h2>

<p>Dog tags, also known as identification tags, are small metal tags that are worn on a chain around the neck. They contain basic information such as name, rank, serial number, and religious preference. The tags are intended to help identify fallen soldiers in the event of death or incapacitation. Dog tags have been in use since at least the American Civil War.</p>

<h2>How Were Dog Tags Used by the Navy?</h2>

<p>The Navy has used dog tags since the early 1900s. The tags were issued to personnel at the time of enlistment and were to be worn at all times while on duty. In addition to basic identification information, the tags also contained the sailor's blood type, which was useful in case of a medical emergency. Dog tags were also used to keep track of personnel on board ships and submarines, as well as when personnel were transferred between vessels.</p>

<h2>Why Did The Navy Stop Issuing Dog Tags?</h2>

<p>In the mid-1970s, the Navy stopped issuing dog tags to personnel. This was due to the fact that the tags were no longer necessary for identification. The Navy had begun using more advanced methods of tracking personnel, such as bar-coding, and the tags had become obsolete. Furthermore, the tags were considered a nuisance by some personnel, who found them uncomfortable to wear.</p>

<h2>The Impact of Dog Tag Discontinuation</h2>

<p>The discontinuation of the Navy's dog tag program had a significant impact on sailors. For many, the tags were a symbol of their service and a reminder of their commitment to the Navy. The removal of the tags was seen by some as a sign that the Navy was forgetting its history and the sacrifices of its personnel.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Navy stopped issuing dog tags in the mid-1970s, due to the fact that they were no longer necessary for identification. The discontinuation of the program had a significant impact on personnel, as the tags had become a symbol of their service and commitment to the Navy.
