<p>Folding a Hover1 scooter is a great way to get around town. It's lightweight and easy to transport, making it an ideal choice for commuting or running errands. In this guide, we'll walk you through the entire folding process, step by step. After reading this guide, you'll be able to fold and unfold your Hover1 scooter quickly and easily.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare to Fold the Scooter</h2>

<p>Before you begin, make sure that you have the necessary tools on hand. You'll need a Phillips-head screwdriver to loosen the screws that hold the handlebars in place. You may also want to use a pair of pliers to help turn the screws.</p>

<p>Once you have the necessary tools, begin by loosening the screws that hold the handlebars in place. On the Hover1 scooter, these screws are located on the underside of the handlebars.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Handlebars</h2>

<p>Once the screws are loosened, you can remove the handlebars. Be sure to hold on to the handlebars as you remove them, as they are heavy and could be dangerous if they were to fall. Once the handlebars are removed, set them aside in a safe place.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Fold the Scooter</h2>

<p>Now that the handlebars are removed, you can fold the scooter. To do this, simply squeeze the two sides of the scooter together until it clicks into place. Once the scooter is folded, it should be about half the size of its original size.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Secure the Scooter</h2>

<p>Once the scooter is folded, it's important to secure it in place. To do this, use the strap located on the side of the scooter. This strap is adjustable and can be used to secure the scooter in its folded position.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Re-attach the Handlebars</h2>

<p>Once the scooter is secured in its folded position, you can re-attach the handlebars. Start by inserting the handlebar into the slot located at the top of the scooter. Once the handlebar is in place, use the Phillips-head screwdriver to tighten the screws that secure it.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Ready to Go!</h2>

<p>Once the handlebars are re-attached, your Hover1 scooter is ready to go. Make sure to check the tires for air pressure before each ride and make sure that all the screws are tightened securely. Now you can enjoy the convenience of your scooter wherever you go.</p>
