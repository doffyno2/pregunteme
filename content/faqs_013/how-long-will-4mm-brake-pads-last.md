<p>Brake pads are a critical part of any vehicle's safety system, and it's important to have a clear understanding of how long they last and when they need to be replaced. 4mm is a common size of brake pad, and the lifespan of 4mm brake pads can vary significantly depending on the type of vehicle they are installed on and the driving conditions they are subjected to. In this article, we'll take a closer look at 4mm brake pads and how long they generally last.</p>

<h2>What is a 4mm Brake Pad?</h2>

<p>A brake pad is a friction material that is used to stop a vehicle when the brakes are applied. Brake pads are most commonly made from a mixture of metal shavings and resin, which is then bonded to a metal backing plate. The thickness of the brake pad is referred to as its 'width' and is measured in millimetres. 4mm is a common width for brake pads and is often used for smaller vehicles such as motorcycles and scooters.</p>

<h2>How Long Do 4mm Brake Pads Last?</h2>

<p>The lifespan of a 4mm brake pad can vary significantly depending on the type of vehicle it is installed on and how it is used. Generally speaking, 4mm brake pads are designed to last between 10,000 and 30,000 miles. However, this number can be affected by variables such as the type of vehicle, the type of road surface, the weight of the vehicle and the driving style of the driver. For example, a vehicle driven primarily on city streets is likely to experience more wear and tear on its brake pads than one driven mostly on highways.</p>

<h2>How to Tell When 4mm Brake Pads Need Replacing</h2>

<p>There are several signs that can indicate when 4mm brake pads need replacing. The most obvious sign is when the brakes start to make a squealing or grinding sound when they are applied. This is caused by metal on metal contact and is a sure sign that the brake pads have worn down and need to be replaced. Other signs include a decrease in stopping power, a longer stopping distance and a pulsing sensation when the brakes are applied.</p>

<h2>How to Replace 4mm Brake Pads</h2>

<p>Replacing 4mm brake pads is a relatively straightforward job that can be done at home with the right tools. First, the wheels of the vehicle need to be removed and the brake calipers need to be unbolted. Once this is done, the old brake pads can be removed and the new ones installed. It is important to ensure that the new pads are fitted correctly and that all bolts are tightened securely. After that, the wheels need to be refitted and the brakes bled to ensure that the brakes are working properly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>4mm brake pads are a common size of brake pad and can be used on a variety of vehicles. The lifespan of 4mm brake pads can vary significantly depending on the type of vehicle they are installed on and the driving conditions they are subjected to. Generally speaking, 4mm brake pads are designed to last between 10,000 and 30,000 miles. Replacing 4mm brake pads is a relatively straightforward job that can be done at home with the right tools.</p>
