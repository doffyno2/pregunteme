<p>The 2004 Toyota Camry is a popular model of vehicle, but over time, you may find that the maintenance light on the dashboard suddenly turns on. This can be a frustrating experience, as you may not know what action to take to turn it off. Fortunately, there is a relatively simple procedure that you can follow in order to reset the maintenance light and get back on the road. Here, we will explain the steps needed to clear the maintenance light on a 2004 Toyota Camry.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check the Gas Cap</h2>

<p>The first step to take when the maintenance light turns on is to check the gas cap. This is because a loose or broken gas cap can cause the maintenance light to appear. Make sure that the cap is securely fastened and that it is not cracked or broken in any way. If it is, you should replace it as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Inspect the Oil Filter</h2>

<p>The oil filter is a critical component of any engine, and it needs to be inspected regularly. If the oil filter is clogged or damaged, it can lead to the maintenance light turning on. To check the filter, locate the filter and unscrew it. Once you have done so, inspect the filter and make sure that it is not blocked or damaged in any way. If it is, then you should replace it with a new one.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Check the Brake Fluid</h2>

<p>The brake fluid is another important component of any vehicle, and it needs to be checked regularly. If the brake fluid is low or contaminated, it can cause the maintenance light to turn on. To check the brake fluid, locate the brake fluid reservoir and open the lid. Make sure that the fluid level is at the correct level and that the fluid is not contaminated in any way. If it is, then you should replace the brake fluid.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Check the Tire Pressure</h2>

<p>The tire pressure is also important when it comes to a vehicle's performance, and it can also cause the maintenance light to turn on if it is not correct. To check the tire pressure, locate the tire pressure gauge and check the pressure of each tire. Make sure that the pressure is at the manufacturer's recommended level. If it is not, then you should adjust the tire pressure accordingly.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Check the Engine Air Filter</h2>

<p>The engine air filter can also cause the maintenance light to appear if it is not functioning correctly. To check the filter, locate the filter and remove it from the engine. Make sure that the filter is not blocked or damaged in any way. If it is, then you should replace it with a new filter.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Reset the Maintenance Light</h2>
