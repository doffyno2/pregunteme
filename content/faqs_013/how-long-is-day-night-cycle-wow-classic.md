One of the most iconic aspects of WoW Classic is the game's day-night cycle. This cycle is important for players to understand, as it can have an effect on various activities in the game.

<h2>What is the Day-Night Cycle?</h2>

The day-night cycle is a feature of most MMORPG games which changes the in-game environment based on the time of day. In WoW Classic, the day-night cycle is based on real-world time, so the time of day in the game matches the time of day in the real world. The cycle runs on a 24-hour clock and changes the lighting, weather, and other elements of the game's environment based on the time of day.

<h2>How Long is the Day-Night Cycle in WoW Classic?</h2>

The day-night cycle in WoW Classic is 24 hours long, just like in real life. This means that the in-game day will last for 24 hours, starting at midnight and ending at midnight the following day.

The day-night cycle also has an effect on the game's monsters, as some monsters will only appear during the day or night.

<h2>How Can Players Change the Day-Night Cycle?</h2>
