Sugar is a popular sweetener in many foods and drinks, and a tablespoon of sugar contains about 12.6 grams of carbohydrates. This is equivalent to around 4.2 grams of sugar per teaspoon. However, it is important to note that the exact amount of carbohydrates in a spoonful of sugar can vary depending on the type of sugar used. For example, white sugar has a higher carbohydrate content than brown sugar.

<h2>What Are Carbohydrates?</h2>
Carbohydrates are an essential macronutrient that provides your body with energy. They are found in a wide variety of foods, including grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and dairy products. The body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which is then used by cells for energy.

Simple carbohydrates are found in foods like sugar, candy, and white bread. They are quickly broken down by the body and can cause spikes in blood sugar levels.

<h2>What Are Some Alternatives to Sugar?</h2>
If you are looking for a healthier alternative to sugar, you may want to consider using natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or agave nectar.
