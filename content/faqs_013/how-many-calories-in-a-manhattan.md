A Manhattan is an iconic cocktail made up of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Angostura bitters. It is a classic drink with a rich history, and a favorite of many cocktail connoisseurs. But how many calories are in a Manhattan?

<h2>Calorie Content of a Manhattan</h2>

A Manhattan typically contains about 130 calories. This is lower than most other cocktails, such as a Mai Tai, which has about 150 calories, or a Margarita, which has about 200 calories. The lower-calorie content of a Manhattan is due to its primarily alcohol content.

<h2>Ingredients in a Manhattan</h2>

A Manhattan typically contains whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Angostura bitters. The ratio of these ingredients will vary depending on personal preference. However, a typical Manhattan is made with two parts whiskey, one part sweet vermouth, and two dashes of Angostura bitters.

<h2>Calorie Content of Whiskey</h2>

Whiskey is the main ingredient in a Manhattan, and it contains about 70 calories per ounce. The higher the proof of the whiskey (i.e. the higher the alcohol content), the higher the calorie content. For example, a shot of 80-proof whiskey contains about 105 calories.

<h2>Calorie Content of Sweet Vermouth</h2>

Sweet vermouth is the second main ingredient in a Manhattan, and it contains about 25 calories per ounce.

<h2>Calorie Content of Angostura Bitters</h2>

Angostura bitters contain a negligible amount of calories, so they do not contribute significantly to the calorie content of a Manhattan.

<h2>Other Factors to Consider</h2>

In addition to the calorie content of the ingredients, the calorie content of a Manhattan may vary depending on other factors, such as the type of whiskey used and the size of the drink. For example, if a Manhattan is made with a higher-proof whiskey, the calorie content will be higher. Similarly, if the drink is larger than a typical Manhattan, the calorie content will be higher.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

A typical Manhattan contains about 130 calories. The calorie content may vary depending on the ingredients used and the size of the drink. However, a Manhattan is typically lower in calories than most other cocktails. So, if you're looking for a lower-calorie option, a Manhattan may be the perfect choice.
