<h2>The Benefits of Pushups</h2>

Pushups are an excellent full-body exercise that can help you build strength, endurance, and muscle tone. They target the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core muscles, so they can help you get ripped and tone your upper body. Pushups also help to improve your cardiovascular health and can even help you burn fat.

<h2>How Many Pushups Should You Do a Day?</h2>

The number of pushups you should do each day depends on your fitness goals and current fitness level. If you are just starting out, aim to do 2-3 sets of 10-15 pushups per day.

Having good form when doing pushups is essential for getting the most out of your workout. Make sure that your hands are placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, your body is in a straight line from your head to your heels, and your core is engaged. Keep your elbows close to your sides and your neck in a neutral position. As you lower your chest to the ground, be sure to keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle.
