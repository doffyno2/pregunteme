<p>Having a matted dog can be a nightmare for both pet owners and the pup itself. If a pup's hair is severely matted, it can cause extreme discomfort and even skin irritation. Matted fur can also trap debris, dirt and bacteria, leading to painful skin infections. Fortunately, there are ways to safely and effectively remove matted dog hair, restoring the pup's coat to its former glory.</p>

<h2>What Causes Matted Dog Hair?</h2>

<p>Matted fur is typically caused by a lack of regular grooming. If a pup's fur is not brushed, combed and clipped regularly, the fur can become matted and tangled. This is especially true for breeds with long hair, such as Poodles, Yorkies, Maltese, and Shih Tzus. Matted fur can also be caused by poor nutrition, parasites, and allergies.</p>

<h2>Identifying Matted Dog Hair</h2>

<p>Matted fur is easily identified by its tangled, matted appearance. It can look like a big clump of fur, and will usually be darker and dirtier than the fur surrounding it. Matted fur can also have an unpleasant smell, due to the build-up of bacteria and dirt trapped within the fur. Some dogs may also have painful areas of skin underneath the matted fur.</p>

<h2>How to Safely Cut Matted Dog Hair</h2>

<p>It is important to not attempt to brush out severely matted fur. This can be very painful for the pup, and can actually pull and break the hair follicles. The best way to safely remove matted fur is to use a pair of thinning shears. These should be used with care, as they are very sharp and can cut the pup's skin if used incorrectly. </p>

<h3>Step 1 - Prepare the Area</h3>

<p>Before attempting to cut the matted fur, it is important to prepare the area. This means ensuring that the pup is comfortable, and that the area is clean and free from debris. This can be done by brushing the pup's fur and trimming any excess fur around the matted area. It is also important to make sure that the pup's skin is not too sensitive or sore.</p>

<h3>Step 2 - Use the Thinning Shears</h3>

<p>Once the area has been prepared, it is time to start cutting the matted fur. Start by gently running the shears over the matted area. Work slowly and carefully, taking care to avoid cutting the pup's skin. If the matted area is very large, it may be necessary to break the area up into smaller sections. </p>

<h3>Step 3 - Finish Up</h3>

<p>Once all of the matted fur has been cut away, it is important to finish up by brushing the pup's fur. This will help to remove any remaining debris and dirt from the area. It is also important to check for any sensitive or sore areas on the pup's skin. If any are found, it is important to contact a veterinarian for further advice.</p>

<h2>Tips for Preventing Matted Fur</h2>

<p>Once the matted fur has been removed, it is important to take steps to prevent the fur from becoming matted again. This can be done by brushing the pup's fur on a regular basis, at least once or twice a week. It is also important to ensure that the pup is eating a balanced and nutritious diet, as this will help to keep the fur healthy and strong. Finally, it is important to check the pup for any parasites or allergies, as these can also cause matted fur.</p>
