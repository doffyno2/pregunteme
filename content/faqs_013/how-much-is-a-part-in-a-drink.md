<p>When it comes to enjoying a good drink, it’s essential to know how much to pour for the best results. Knowing the size of a standard drink and the size of a “part” can help you make sure you have the perfect glass of whatever it is you’re drinking. But what exactly is a “part”?</p>

<p>A “part” is a unit of measurement commonly used in mixology. In the context of drinks, a “part” is equal to one ounce (0.1 oz). A “part” is usually used when referring to the amount of alcohol in a drink, such as how much vodka, gin, or whiskey is in a cocktail. It is also used when referring to the amount of a non-alcoholic mixer, such as orange juice or tonic water.</p>

<h2>How Many Parts are in a Standard Drink?</h2>

<p>A standard drink is equal to 14 grams of pure alcohol. This is roughly equivalent to 12 ounces (0.4 fl oz) of beer, 5 ounces (0.15 fl oz) of wine, or 1.5 ounces (0.04 fl oz) of 80-proof distilled spirits. Therefore, a standard drink is equal to 1.2 parts.</p>

<h2>How Many Parts Should You Pour into a Drink?</h2>

<p>The amount of parts you should pour into a drink depends on the type of drink. Cocktails usually contain 1-2 parts of alcohol and 1-2 parts of a non-alcoholic mixer. For example, a vodka tonic would contain 2 parts vodka and 2 parts tonic water. On the other hand, a whiskey sour would contain 2 parts whiskey and 1 part simple syrup. When making a mixed drink, it’s important to follow the recipe and not exceed the recommended amount of parts.</p>

<p>When it comes to beer, wine, or other non-alcoholic drinks, there is no “standard” amount of parts. Generally speaking, it’s best to follow the instructions on the bottle. However, for beer and wine, it’s usually safe to pour a single part, which is equal to 12 ounces (0.4 fl oz) of beer or 5 ounces (0.15 fl oz) of wine.</p>

<h2>Are Parts and Ounces the Same?</h2>

<p>No, parts and ounces are not the same. As mentioned before, a part is equal to one ounce (0.1 oz), while an ounce is equal to 0.1 parts. This means that you would need 10 parts to make one ounce and one ounce to make one part.</p>

<h2>What is a Jigger?</h2>

<p>A jigger is a small measuring cup or shot glass used to measure out spirits for cocktails. It is usually shaped like an hourglass and contains two parts separated by a thin wall. The larger part is equal to 1.5 ounces (0.04 fl oz) and the smaller part is equal to 1 ounce (0.1 fl oz). This makes it easy for bartenders to measure out 1.5 parts of a spirit for a cocktail.</p>
