<h2>What Kind of Fish are in the Sea of Galilee?</h2>

<h2>What Efforts Are Being Made to Protect the Fish in the Sea of Galilee?</h2>

<p>The Israeli government has also implemented a number of regulations to ensure that commercial fishermen are not overfishing in the lake. These regulations include restrictions on the amount of fishing gear that can be used, as well as restrictions on the amount of time that fishermen can spend on the lake. Additionally, the government has established a number of marine reserves in the lake, which are designed to protect the habitat of the fish.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The amount of commercial fish in the Sea of Galilee is difficult to estimate, but recent estimates suggest that it is between 15 and 20 million.
