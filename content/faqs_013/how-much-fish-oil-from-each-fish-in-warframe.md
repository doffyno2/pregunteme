Fish oil is a special resource used for crafting and upgrading weapons in Warframe. It is an essential component in the game that can be obtained from fishing on various planets and locations. Knowing how much fish oil you can get from each fish is important for efficient resource gathering.

<h2>What is Fish Oil?</h2>

Fish oil is a special resource used in Warframe for crafting and upgrading weapons, armor, and other items. It is obtained from fishing on various planets and locations throughout the game. The oil is a thick, black substance that can be used as a component in many different recipes.

<h2>How to Get Fish Oil in Warframe?</h2>

Fish oil can be obtained by catching fish with a fishing spear on any planet or location that supports fishing. Different types of fish will produce different amounts of fish oil when caught. To maximize your fish oil yield, it’s important to know which fish yield the most oil.

<h2>Which Fish Yield the Most Fish Oil?</h2>

The following fish yield the most fish oil when caught:

<h3>1. Gantulyst</h3>

The Gantulyst is a large fish that can be found in the Plains of Eidolon. It yields a large amount of fish oil when caught, making it a great resource for those who want to get the most out of their fishing trips.

<h3>2. Kuaka</h3>

The Kuaka is a small fish that can be found in the Orb Vallis. It yields a moderate amount of fish oil when caught, making it a good choice for those who are looking to stock up on the resource.

<h3>3. Cuthol</h3>

The Cuthol is a large fish that can be found in the Orb Vallis. It yields a small amount of fish oil when caught, making it a decent choice for those who want to get some of the resource without spending too much time fishing.

Bringing a fishing spear is essential for catching fish and obtaining fish oil. Without a fishing spear, it’s impossible to catch fish, so make sure you have one before you start fishing.

<h3>2. Look For Bigger Fish</h3>

Bigger fish tend to yield more fish oil when caught, so try to look for larger fish when fishing. This will help you get more fish oil from each trip.

<h3>3. Return To The Same Spot</h3>

Returning to the same spot can help you maximize your fish oil yield. Fish will often respawn in the same spot after a certain amount of time, so returning to the same spot can help you get more fish oil without having to spend too much time fishing.
