Fish is an incredibly versatile and nutritious food that can be served in a variety of ways. Whether you’re opting for a light, airy fish sandwich or a hearty fish stew, knowing how much to serve per person is essential for getting the most out of your meal.

<h2>How Much Fish Should I Serve per Person?</h2>

In general, a healthy portion size of fish is three to four ounces, or about one-fourth of a pound. This provides about 200 to 250 calories, depending on the type of fish. When preparing a meal at home, a good rule of thumb is to plan for one-half pound of fish per person. This will give you enough food to feed everyone without leftovers.

<h2>Types of Fish Servings</h2>

When deciding how much fish to serve per person, the type of fish and the way it is prepared should be taken into consideration. For instance, fish that is fried or breaded will be less dense and lighter than fish that is baked or grilled.

<h3>Raw Fish Servings</h3>

Raw fish, such as sushi, sashimi, and ceviche, is generally served in smaller portions than cooked fish. When serving raw fish at a dinner party, plan for one-third to one-half pound of fish per person.

<h3>Cooked Fish Servings</h3>

Cooked fish tends to be heavier, so a larger portion of cooked fish is typically served per person. When serving cooked fish, plan for one-half to three-fourths pound of fish per person.

<h2>How to Measure Fish Servings</h2>

It can be difficult to estimate the exact amount of fish that is needed for a meal. To ensure that you are serving the right amount of fish per person, it is best to weigh the fish prior to cooking. A kitchen scale is the best tool for accurately measuring fish servings.
