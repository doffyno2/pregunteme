No see ums, also known as biting midges, sand gnats, punkies, or noseeums, are tiny, blood-sucking insects that can be found in many parts of the world. These parasitic pests are a nuisance to both humans and animals, and can be difficult to get rid of. Fortunately, there are a few natural methods you can try to get rid of no see ums without the use of harsh chemicals.

<h2>What are No See Ums?</h2>

No see ums are tiny, biting insects that measure between 1/20 and 1/8 of an inch in length. They are usually gray or black in color, but their wings can range from yellow to dark brown. Though they’re not considered to be true mosquitoes, they look very similar. However, unlike mosquitoes, they don’t have the long antennae or the long legs. 

No see ums are most active during the day and are attracted to light, making them a common sight near windows and doorways. They feed on the blood of both humans and animals and have a very painful bite. They typically bite exposed skin and can cause localized swelling and itching.

<h2>Where Do No See Ums Live?</h2>

No see ums can be found in many parts of the world, especially in warm, humid climates. They live in moist environments and can be found in areas with standing water, such as swamps, marshes, and ponds. They can also be found in grassy and sandy areas, as well as near rivers and streams.
