<p>Fishing worms are a great way to stock up your tackle box and always be ready for a fishing trip. But it’s important to know how to keep your worms alive in order to get the most out of your bait. So how long do fishing worms stay alive in the fridge?</p>

<p>The short answer is that fishing worms can stay alive in the fridge for 7 to 14 days. However, this depends on the temperature and humidity of the fridge, as well as the type of worms you’re keeping. Here’s a closer look at what you need to know about keeping your worms alive in the fridge.</p>

<h2>What Temperature and Humidity Should You Keep Fishing Worms In?</h2>

<p>When you’re keeping worms in the fridge, the temperature should be between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Any colder than this can put your worms into hibernation, and any warmer can cause them to die. The humidity should also be kept between 75 and 90%. If the humidity is too low, your worms will dry out and die, so it’s important to keep an eye on the humidity.</p>

<h2>What Type of Container Should You Use?</h2>

<p>Once you have the temperature and humidity set, you’ll need to choose an appropriate container to store your worms in. A clear plastic container is ideal, as it will allow you to keep an eye on your worms and make sure they’re still alive. If you’re using a container with a lid, make sure to poke some holes in it to allow for air circulation.</p>

<p>You’ll also want to make sure that the container is large enough for your worms to move around. If the container is too small, the worms will be cramped and may not survive. A container that’s too large, on the other hand, can cause the worms to dry out.</p>

<h2>What Should You Put in the Container?</h2>

<p>When you’re preparing your worms for the fridge, you’ll need to make sure they have enough food and moisture. You can add some water or moist soil to the bottom of the container, as well as some food like oatmeal or bran. This will keep your worms alive and healthy while they’re in the fridge.</p>

<h2>Do Fishing Worms Need to Be Kept in the Dark?</h2>

<p>While it’s important to keep your worms in a cool, dark place, they don’t necessarily need to be kept in complete darkness. In fact, some types of worms may be able to tolerate some light. If you’re keeping your worms in a clear container, you may want to cover it with a cloth or towel to keep the light out.</p>

<h2>Can You Freeze Fishing Worms?</h2>

<p>Some types of worms can be frozen for long-term storage, but it’s not recommended for most types of fishing worms. Freezing temperatures can damage or kill the worms, so it’s best to avoid freezing them if possible.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Knowing how to keep your worms alive in the fridge is an important part of fishing. Fishing worms can stay alive in the fridge for 7 to 14 days, but this depends on the temperature, humidity, and type of worms you’re keeping. Make sure to use a clear plastic container with some holes in the lid, and add some water or moist soil as well as some food to keep your worms alive and healthy.</p>
