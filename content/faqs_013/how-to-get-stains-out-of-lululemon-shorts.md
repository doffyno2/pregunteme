<p>If you’ve ever owned a pair of Lululemon shorts, you’ll know that they’re incredibly versatile and comfortable. From running errands to hitting the gym, they’re the perfect shorts for any and all activities. But, no matter how careful you are, accidents can and do happen. Whether you’ve spilled your smoothie or got caught in the rain, it’s not uncommon to find yourself with stained Lululemon shorts. But, don’t panic! With a few simple tips and tricks, you can get your shorts looking as good as new in no time.</p>

<h2>1. Pre-treatment</h2>

<p>Before you start treating stains, it’s important to take a few precautionary steps. Firstly, you should check the care label on your shorts. This should give you an idea of which detergents and techniques are safe to use. Generally, Lululemon shorts are made from a blend of materials, so you should use a gentle detergent designed for delicates. If the care label indicates, you can also add a small amount of bleach to the wash, which will help to break down tough stains.</p>

<p>Secondly, you should avoid using hot water when treating stains. Although hot water can be effective in removing tough stains, it can also damage your shorts. Instead, use cold or lukewarm water to gently remove the stain.</p>

<h2>2. Removing Stains from Fabric</h2>

<p>If you’ve spilled food or drink on your shorts, the first step is to gently dab the area with a damp cloth. This will help to remove any excess liquid and prevent the stain from spreading. It’s important to avoid scrubbing the fabric, as this can damage the material.</p>

<p>Once you’ve dabbed the area with a cloth, you should apply a small amount of detergent directly to the stain. Make sure to use a gentle detergent, as harsh chemicals can damage the fabric. You should then leave the detergent to sit for 10-15 minutes before washing your shorts as normal.</p>

<h2>3. Removing Stains from Leather</h2>

<p>If the stain on your Lululemon shorts is on the leather trim, you should be extra careful when cleaning it. Firstly, you should use a damp cloth to gently wipe away any excess liquid. You should then apply a small amount of leather cleaner to the affected area and leave it for 10-15 minutes. Once the cleaner has had time to work its magic, you should buff the leather with a dry cloth.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that leather cleaners can be quite harsh, so you should always make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle. If you’re in any doubt, it’s best to take your shorts to a professional cleaner.</p>

<h2>4. Washing Your Shorts</h2>

<p>Once you’ve treated the stain, you should wash your shorts as normal. Make sure to check the care label on your shorts, as this will give you an idea of which detergents and temperatures are suitable for your shorts. Generally, you should use a gentle detergent and a cold or lukewarm wash. You should also avoid using the tumble dryer, as this can damage the fabric.</p>

<p>Once the washing cycle is complete, you should hang your shorts up to air dry. This will help to ensure that your shorts keep their shape and avoid any shrinkage.</p>
