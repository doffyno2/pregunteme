<p>Lake Ontario is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. With a surface area of 7,340 square miles, it is the smallest of the Great Lakes by surface area, and the 14th largest lake in the world. It is bounded on the north and southwest by the Canadian province of Ontario, and on the south and east by the US state of New York. Its shoreline is shared by the two countries.</p>

<p>Lake Ontario is a significant source of fresh water, and is an important part of the global water cycle. The lake contains over 6 quadrillion gallons of water, making it an important source of fresh water for both Canada and the United States. The lake's water level is regulated by the International Joint Commission to ensure that it is kept at a safe and healthy level for all of its users.</p>

<p>In terms of its size, Lake Ontario is the smallest of the Great Lakes. Its average depth is only 283 feet, and its maximum depth is 802 feet. Its total surface area is 7,340 square miles, which makes it roughly the same size as the state of Maine. Its surface elevation is 243 feet above sea level.</p>

<h2>How Much Water is in Lake Ontario?</h2>

<p>Lake Ontario holds an estimated 6 quadrillion gallons of water, or 6,000,000,000,000,000 gallons. This equates to roughly 24,000 cubic miles of water, making it the 14th largest lake in the world by volume. It is also the smallest of the Great Lakes by surface area.</p>

<h2>How Does the Water Level in Lake Ontario Change?</h2>

<p>The water level in Lake Ontario is regulated by the International Joint Commission, which is a bi-national organization in charge of managing the lake's water level. The Commission's mandate is to maintain a safe and healthy water level for all users. They do this through a system of dams and other infrastructure that is designed to control the lake's water level.</p>

<p>The Commission's goal is to maintain the lake's water level within a range of 243 to 249 feet above sea level. This range was established in order to prevent flooding and to provide optimal levels of water for recreational activities, such as boating and fishing. The Commission also monitors the lake's water level closely and makes adjustments to it as necessary in order to ensure that it remains within the desired range.</p>

<h2>How Much Water Does Lake Ontario Provide to the Great Lakes Basin?</h2>

<p>Lake Ontario is a major source of fresh water for the Great Lakes Basin, and contributes a significant amount of water to the other lakes. It is estimated that Lake Ontario provides roughly 18% of the total water to the Great Lakes Basin, making it the second largest contributor after Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Lake Ontario also plays an important role in regulating the flow of water between the other Great Lakes. Its outlet, the St. Lawrence River, is a major passageway for water from Lake Ontario to the other Great Lakes. This helps to ensure that the water levels of the other lakes remain consistent, and that the water from each lake is shared between them.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Lake Ontario's Water?</h2>

<p>Lake Ontario's water has a number of benefits for the people who live in the Great Lakes Basin. Its water is used for drinking and irrigation, and its wetlands provide important habitat for wildlife. It also provides an important source of income for local communities, through activities such as fishing, boating, and tourism.</p>

<p>The lake is also a major source of hydroelectric power. Its water is used to generate electricity, which is then used to power homes and businesses. This helps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and provides a clean source of energy that is both renewable and sustainable.</p>
