<p>Truck frames are an integral part of any vehicle, providing the necessary strength and support to ensure a safe ride.

<h2>What Causes Damage to a Truck Frame?</h2>

<p>Truck frames can be damaged for a variety of reasons. These include accidents, bad driving habits, and general wear and tear. Accidents are the most common cause of frame damage, and can range from minor dents and scrapes to major structural damage. Bad driving habits, such as driving over curbs or potholes, can also cause frame damage, as can prolonged exposure to the elements.
