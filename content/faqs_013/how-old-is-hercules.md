Hercules is one of the most iconic characters in mythology and folklore. He is known for his superhuman strength and incredible feats of courage, but how old is he? In this article, we'll explore the age of Hercules and how it is depicted in various sources.

<h2>The Ancient Sources Of Hercules' Age</h2>

Hercules was a figure in ancient Greek mythology, and his age is often discussed in various sources. In the ancient poem "The Shield of Heracles" by Hesiod, Hercules is described as being "thirty years old". In the Illiad, written by Homer around the 8th century BC, Hercules is said to have been born "not less than fifty years before the Trojan War". This would make him around eighty years old at the time of the war.

In Roman mythology, Hercules is a popular figure and is seen as a symbol of strength and courage. In Roman sources, Hercules is often said to have been born when the goddess Juno was pregnant with him, making him around five hundred years old at the time of the Trojan War. This would put his age at around five hundred and fifty at the time of his death.

<h2>The Age Of Hercules In The Bible</h2>

The Bible does not explicitly mention Hercules, but there are some references to him in the Old Testament. In the book of Judges, it is said that Hercules was a man of great strength and courage who was "gifted with a mighty hand". This could suggest that he was a man of advanced age, as he was said to have already achieved great feats before the Trojan War.

<h2>The Ages Of Hercules In Modern Culture</h2>

In modern culture, Hercules is often depicted as a young man in his twenties or thirties. This is likely due to the fact that he has been a popular figure in literature, film, and other forms of media for many years. In some versions of the myth, it is said that Hercules was born after Zeus impregnated Alcmene, making him around two thousand years old at the time of his death.
