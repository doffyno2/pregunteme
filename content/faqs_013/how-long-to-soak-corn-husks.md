<p>Soaking corn husks is a necessary step in making tamales, tacos, and other traditional Mexican dishes. If you're using dried corn husks, you'll need to soak them in warm water for a few hours before you can use them. Although the specifics will depend on the recipe you're using, there are some general guidelines to follow.</p>

<h2>What Are Corn Husks?</h2>

<p>Corn husks are the outermost layers of a corn cob. They have a papery texture and are typically dried, although they can be purchased fresh in some areas. Corn husks are used for a variety of culinary purposes, including making tamales and tacos. They are also used for crafts and decorations.</p>

<h2>Why Soak Corn Husks?</h2>

<p>Soaking corn husks helps to make them pliable, which is necessary in order to wrap them around the filling of the tamale or taco. Without soaking, the husks would be too brittle to use. Additionally, soaking helps to reduce the bitterness of the husks, making them more palatable. Finally, soaking can help to add flavor to the husks by infusing them with the flavor of the liquid in which they are soaked. </p>

<h2>How Long to Soak Corn Husks?</h2>

<p>Corn husks should be soaked in warm water for at least two hours, and up to 12 hours. Soaking for longer than 12 hours can cause the husks to become too soft and fragile. If you're in a hurry, you can use hot water to speed up the process, although it's not recommended. Hot water can cause the husks to become too soft and can also compromise their flavor. It's best to use warm water and give them plenty of time to soak.</p>

<h2>Soaking Tips</h2>

<p>When soaking corn husks, it's important to make sure the husks are completely submerged. If some of the husks are sticking out of the water, they won't soak evenly. You can use a plate to weigh down the husks and make sure they're all soaked properly. Additionally, it's important to change the water frequently. If the water becomes cloudy or discolored, it's best to change it to ensure the husks don't become contaminated.</p>

<h2>Uses for Soaked Corn Husks</h2>

<p>Soaked corn husks can be used for tamales, tacos, and other traditional Mexican dishes. They can also be used for crafts and decorations, such as making corn husk dolls or wreaths. Finally, they can be used to make a traditional Mexican drink called atole. Atole is a thick, warm drink made with corn flour, sugar, and spices. </p>
