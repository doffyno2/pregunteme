<p>Swai fish is a type of catfish native to Southeast Asia. It's known for its mild flavor and firm texture, making it a popular choice for many fish dishes. It can also be cooked in a variety of ways, including baking, frying, or grilling. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to prepare Swai fish, baking it in the oven is your best bet. But how long should you cook frozen Swai fish in the oven?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the size and thickness of the Swai fish fillet you're using. Generally speaking, you should cook frozen Swai fish in an oven preheated to 400°F (204°C) for 15-20 minutes. If you're using a thicker fillet, you may need to increase the cooking time by a few minutes. To ensure your fish is cooked through, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the fish. It should reach 145°F (63°C) for it to be considered safe to eat.</p>

<p>Before baking your frozen Swai fish, it's important to prepare it correctly. Start by rinsing the fillet under cold running water and patting it dry with a paper towel. Next, season the fish with your preferred herbs and spices, such as salt, pepper, garlic powder, or paprika. Finally, lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil or cooking spray and place the fish on top. Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the Swai fish for 15-20 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).</p>

<p>Once the Swai fish is cooked through, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. You can serve the fish with a side of roasted vegetables or a salad for a complete meal. You can also top it with a squeeze of lemon juice or your favorite sauce for added flavor.</p>
