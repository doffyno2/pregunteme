<p>Cracking your sternum, also known as sternal separation, is a procedure that can be carried out in a doctor’s office or hospital setting. The procedure involves the use of a special instrument called a sternal separator, which is used to separate the sternum so that the patient can have access to the area of the chest that is affected. This procedure is often used to treat conditions related to the ribs, such as rib fractures, or to improve the range of motion of the chest wall.</p>

<p>The procedure is relatively simple and straightforward, and it involves the insertion of a separator into the chest wall between the two halves of the sternum. The separator is then used to push the two halves of the sternum apart, allowing the patient to gain access to the area of the chest that is affected. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthetic and can take up to an hour. In some cases, the patient may require general anesthesia.</p>

<h2>Why Might You Need to Crack Your Sternum?</h2>

<p>Cracking your sternum may be necessary in order to treat a variety of conditions that involve the ribs or chest wall. It may be used to treat rib fractures or other injuries, or to improve the range of motion of the chest wall. In some cases, it may also be necessary to perform the procedure in order to gain access to the chest cavity in order to perform surgery or other procedures.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Risks Involved With Cracking Your Sternum?</h2>

<p>As with any medical procedure, there are some risks associated with cracking your sternum. These include infection, bleeding, nerve damage, and pain. It is important to discuss any potential risks with your doctor before undergoing the procedure.</p>

<h2>What Happens During the Procedure?</h2>

<p>The procedure begins with the patient lying on their back. The doctor then inserts the separator into the chest wall between the two halves of the sternum. The separator is then used to push the two halves of the sternum apart. The patient may feel some discomfort during this process, but this should not last long.</p>

<p>Once the sternum is successfully separated, the doctor will be able to gain access to the area of the chest that is affected. Depending on the underlying condition, the doctor may then take further steps to treat the condition, such as performing surgery or inserting a device. After the procedure is complete, the patient will be monitored until the effects of the anesthetic have worn off.</p>

<h2>What Happens After the Procedure?</h2>

<p>After the procedure is complete, the patient should take it easy for a few days and avoid any strenuous physical activity. The patient should also take any medications that were prescribed by the doctor. In some cases, the patient may need to wear a chest brace for a few weeks to support the sternum and help it heal.</p>

<p>The patient should also pay close attention to any signs of infection or other complications, such as pain or swelling. If any of these symptoms occur, the patient should contact their doctor right away.</p>
