Metamucil is a popular fiber supplement for humans, but did you know that it can also be used for dogs? It is a safe, natural way to improve your dog's digestion and overall health. In this article, we will look at how to give your dog Metamucil and the potential benefits it can provide.

<h2>What is Metamucil?</h2>

Metamucil is a brand name for a fiber supplement containing psyllium husk. Psyllium husk is a form of soluble dietary fiber derived from the Plantago ovata plant. It is the main ingredient in Metamucil and other brands of psyllium husk supplements. 

Psyllium husk is a type of dietary fiber that is not broken down or digested in the small intestine. Instead, it passes into the large intestine where it absorbs water and increases the bulk of the stool. This helps to move food through the digestive tract more quickly and prevents constipation. Psyllium husk is also a prebiotic, which means it feeds the good bacteria in the gut and helps to promote healthy digestion.
