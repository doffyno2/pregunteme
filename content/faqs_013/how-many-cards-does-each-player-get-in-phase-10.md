Phase 10 is a popular card game played by two to four players. The objective of the game is to complete the 10 phases of sequences before your opponents. To do this, players must draw and discard cards in order to make sets and runs of the same color or number. With each phase completed, the game becomes more difficult and the stakes become higher. So, how many cards does each player get in Phase 10?

<h2>Number of Cards in a Deck</h2>

A standard Phase 10 deck contains 108 cards, and includes four sets of colored cards numbered 1-12, plus two Wild cards (one blue and one orange). The Wild cards can act as any number or any color, and are used to help players complete the phases. 

<h2>Number of Players in the Game</h2>

Phase 10 is played with two to four players. The number of players in the game will determine the number of cards each player will receive. If two players are playing, each player will receive 10 cards. If three or four people are playing, each player will receive seven cards. 

<h2>How to Deal the Cards</h2>

When playing with two to four players, the dealer must deal the cards one at a time starting with the person to their left. The dealer should then continue clockwise until all the cards have been dealt. The remaining cards should be placed face down in the center of the table to form a draw pile.

<h2>What to Do with the Unused Cards</h2>

If there are any cards left over after the players have received their cards, the dealer should place them face down in the middle of the table to form a discard pile. This discard pile will be used when players need to draw a card to complete a phase. 

<h2>Drawing and Discarding</h2>

Once the cards have been dealt, players will take turns drawing a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. Players can then choose to either keep the card or discard it. If the card is kept, it must be placed in the player's hand, and if it is discarded, it should be placed face up in the discard pile. 

<h2>What Happens if a Player Runs Out of Cards?</h2>

If a player runs out of cards, they must draw from the draw pile until they have the maximum number of cards in their hand, depending on the number of players in the game. If a player has seven cards in their hand and there are only two players in the game, the player must draw three more cards from the draw pile. 

<h2>Scoring</h2>

At the end of the game, each player will count the number of cards remaining in their hand. The player with the fewest number of cards remaining will receive the fewest points and the player with the most cards remaining will receive the most points. The player with the fewest points at the end of the game is the winner.
