<p>Tablets are an increasingly popular choice for those who want the convenience of a laptop but the portability of a smartphone. Unfortunately, like any other device, tablets can experience problems that can lead to a need for repair. One of the most common issues is a cracked or broken screen.

<h2>Types of Tablet Screen Repairs</h2>

<p>When it comes to tablet screen repairs, there are two main types of repairs available: replacement or repair.

Repairing the screen, on the other hand, is often less expensive but the results may not last as long. Before deciding on a repair option, it's important to understand the type of damage that has been done. If the damage is extensive, it may be more cost effective to replace the screen entirely.</p>

Generally speaking, the cost of a replacement screen is higher than the cost of a repair.
