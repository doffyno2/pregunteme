<p>Brake lines are one of the most important components in the brake system of any vehicle.

Therefore, it is essential to keep the brake lines in good condition and replace them when necessary. The cost of repairing brake lines will depend on several factors, including the type of vehicle, the type of brake lines, and the complexity of the repair.</p>

<p>There are two types of brake lines: steel and rubber. Steel brake lines are more durable and last longer, but they are more expensive than rubber lines. Steel brake lines are typically used in heavy-duty vehicles, such as commercial trucks, while rubber brake lines are usually used in lighter vehicles, such as passenger cars.</p>
