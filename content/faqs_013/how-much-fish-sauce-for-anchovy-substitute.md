Anchovies are a small fish that are commonly used in Mediterranean, Asian, and Mexican cooking. They are an essential ingredient in many dishes, from Caesar salad dressing to pasta sauces. But anchovies are not always easy to find, and sometimes they can be quite expensive. 

Fortunately, there is a great anchovy substitute that is both easy to find and inexpensive: fish sauce. Fish sauce is a condiment made from fermented fish and salt and is used in many cuisines around the world. It has a strong, salty flavor that works wonderfully as an anchovy substitute. But how much fish sauce should you use when substituting for anchovies?

<h2>The Different Types of Fish Sauce</h2>

Before we can answer the question of how much fish sauce to use as an anchovy substitute, it’s important to understand the different types of fish sauce available. Fish sauce comes in a variety of types, with different flavor profiles and levels of saltiness. 

The most common type of fish sauce is nam pla, which is made from fermented fish and salt. This type of fish sauce is popular in Southeast Asian cuisines, such as Thai and Vietnamese. It is usually quite salty, but can also have a slightly sweet taste. 

Other types of fish sauce include nuoc mam, which is made from fermented anchovies, and patis, which is made from fermented shrimp and salt. Both of these types of fish sauce are popular in Southeast Asian cuisines, and they tend to be less salty than nam pla.

<h2>How Much Fish Sauce Should You Use as an Anchovy Substitute?</h2>

As a general rule, you should use about three times as much fish sauce as you would anchovies. If a recipe calls for one tablespoon of anchovies, you should use three tablespoons of fish sauce. 

For nam pla, you may want to start with less fish sauce, as it can be quite salty. Start with two tablespoons of nam pla and adjust the amount to taste. You can always add more fish sauce, but it’s difficult to take it away once it’s added.
