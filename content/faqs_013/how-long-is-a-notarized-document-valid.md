<p>A notarized document is a document that has been signed and stamped by a notary public, a public official who can certify the authenticity of a signature or document. A notarized document is a document that is legally binding and is used in many situations. But the question is, how long is a notarized document valid?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the type of document that has been notarized and the laws in the jurisdiction in which the document was notarized. There is no set amount of time that a notarized document is valid for as different documents expire at different times. However, there are certain documents that are typically valid for longer periods of time than others. For example, a deed to property is generally valid for up to six years, while a will is typically valid for up to five years.</p>
