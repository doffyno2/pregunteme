<p>You love your dog, but you don't love the smell that comes with having a pup around the house. Whether it's from drool, fur, or just general pet odors, it can be difficult to get rid of the scent. Fortunately, there are many simple and effective ways to get dog smell out of blankets and keep your home smelling fresh and clean.</p>

<h2>Vinegar and Baking Soda</h2>
<p>Vinegar and baking soda are two of the most commonly used ingredients for getting rid of pet odors.

Run the machine on the hottest setting and add an extra rinse cycle to ensure that all of the odors have been removed. After the cycle is complete, hang the blankets to air dry.</p>

<h2>Odor Eliminators</h2>
