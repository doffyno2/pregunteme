<p>Are you looking to get in shape and lose some weight? If so, one of the best ways to do it is by burning calories. The amount of calories you can burn by walking 2 miles varies depending on your weight, speed, and gender. In this article, we’ll discuss how many calories you can burn by walking 2 miles, as well as other tips on how to make the most of your walks. </p>

<h2>How Many Calories Does Walking 2 Miles Burn?</h2>

<p>The exact number of calories you burn when walking 2 miles varies from person to person, but on average, a person weighing 155 pounds will burn about 223 calories by walking 2 miles at a moderate pace. The number of calories burned is higher for people who weigh more and lower for those who weigh less. If you weigh more than 155 pounds, you can expect to burn more calories than the average. On the other hand, if you weigh less than 155 pounds, you can expect to burn fewer calories. </p>

<p>In addition to your weight, the speed at which you are walking and your gender also play a role in the number of calories you will burn. If you walk 2 miles at a faster pace, such as a brisk walk or a jog, you will burn more calories than if you were walking at a moderate pace. Women also tend to burn fewer calories than men when walking the same distance. </p>

<h2>Tips for Making the Most of Your Walks</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to maximize the number of calories you burn when walking 2 miles, there are a few things you can do. First, increase your speed. Walking at a brisk pace or jogging can help you burn more calories in the same amount of time. You can also add some incline to your walk. If you’re walking on a flat surface, try walking up a hill or stairs to increase the intensity of your workout.</p>

<p>Another way to increase the number of calories you burn is to add some resistance. You can do this by wearing a weighted vest or carrying a backpack. This will add some extra weight to your body, which will make it harder to move, thus burning more calories.</p>
