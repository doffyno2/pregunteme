<p>Maple tree helicopters, also known as maple seedlings, are a common sight in the spring. They are the result of maple tree seeds sprouting and growing in your yard. While they look beautiful, they can quickly become a nuisance, as they compete with your other plants for resources, and can quickly take over your garden. If youâ€™re wondering how to get rid of maple tree helicopters, there are a few different methods to try.</p>

<h2>What Are Maple Tree Helicopters?</h2>

<p>Maple tree helicopters, also known as maple seedlings, are the small, green, lopsided helicopters that you see spinning and twirling in the air during the spring. These helicopters are actually helicopter-shaped maple tree seeds. Maple trees produce these helicopters in order to spread their seeds and reproduce.</p>

<h2>How to Get Rid of Maple Tree Helicopters</h2>

<p>There are a few different methods to get rid of maple tree helicopters. Depending on your situation, one or more methods may be more effective than others.</p>

<h3>Removal by Hand</h3>

<p>One way to get rid of maple tree helicopters is to simply pick them up by hand. This is one of the most labor-intensive methods, but it is also the most effective. You can pick up the helicopters as they appear in your yard, or you can simply rake them up. Be sure to wear gloves when picking up the helicopters, as the little seeds can be sharp.</p>

<h3>Mulching</h3>

<p>Another way to get rid of maple tree helicopters is to mulch the area where they are appearing. Mulching will smother the maple tree helicopters and prevent them from sprouting and growing. Be sure to use a thick layer of mulch and cover the entire area where the helicopters are appearing.</p>

Raking up fallen helicopters and removing them from your yard can help prevent the helicopters from reappearing in the future.
