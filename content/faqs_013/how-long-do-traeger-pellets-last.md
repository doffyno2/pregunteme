<p>Traeger pellets are made from compressed sawdust, which is then flavored with natural wood smoke. Their unique flavor and smoke level make them the perfect choice for grilling, smoking, and baking. But how long do Traeger pellets last?</p>

<p>The shelf life of Traeger pellets depends on a few factors, including the type of pellets you choose, how you store them, and the environment in which they are kept. Generally speaking, Traeger pellets will last up to two years if stored properly. However, they can begin to lose their flavor and potency after just a few months.</p>

<h2>Types of Traeger Pellets</h2>

<p>The shelf life of Traeger pellets varies depending on the type you choose. Traeger offers several different types of pellets, including hardwood, softwood, and specialty blends. Hardwood pellets are the most popular and have a shelf life of up to two years. Softwood pellets, on the other hand, have a shorter shelf life of up to one year.</p>

<p>Traeger also offers specialty blends, such as apple wood, cherry wood, and mesquite wood. These blends typically have a shorter shelf life of up to six months. Regardless of the type you choose, it's important to store them properly to ensure the best possible shelf life.</p>

<h2>Storing Traeger Pellets</h2>

<p>Traeger pellets should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This will help keep them fresh and prevent them from absorbing moisture or developing mold. It's also important to make sure the container is sealed tightly to prevent pests from getting in.</p>

<p>For long-term storage, it's best to use a vacuum-sealed bag or container. This will help keep the pellets fresh for up to two years. If you need to store them for a longer period of time, you can freeze them to extend their shelf life. However, this should only be done if you plan on using them within a few months.</p>

<h2>Using Traeger Pellets</h2>

<p>Once you open a bag of Traeger pellets, it's important to use them within a few months. If you don't, they will begin to lose their flavor and potency. As such, it's best to only purchase as many pellets as you need for a few months at a time.</p>

<p>If you do have leftover pellets, you should store them in a sealed container and use them within a few months. If you don't think you'll use them within that time frame, it's best to dispose of them and purchase a new bag.</p>
