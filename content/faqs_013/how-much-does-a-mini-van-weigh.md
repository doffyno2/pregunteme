<h2> Factors that Affect a Mini Vanâ€™s Weight </h2>

There are several factors that can affect the weight of a mini van. These include the size of the vehicle, the number of passengers it can seat, and the type of materials used to construct it. For example, a larger mini van will usually weigh more than a smaller one. The number of passengers it can seat also affects its weight, as larger mini vans can seat more passengers and, thus, will weigh more. The type of materials used to construct the mini van, such as steel or aluminum, also affects its weight.
