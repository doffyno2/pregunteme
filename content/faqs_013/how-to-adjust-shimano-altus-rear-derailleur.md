<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Shimano Altus rear derailleurs are renowned for their smooth shifting, reliable performance, and long-lasting durability. They are lightweight components that feature a simple design and easy maintenance. Adjusting a Shimano Altus rear derailleur is a straightforward process, and it is an essential part of bike maintenance. This guide will explain the steps required to adjust a Shimano Altus rear derailleur and ensure that it shifts smoothly and accurately.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed</h2>

<p>To adjust a Shimano Altus rear derailleur, you will need the following tools and materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screwdriver</li>
  <li>Cable cutters</li>
  <li>Allen key</li>
  <li>Chain whip</li>
  <li>Cable ties</li>
  <li>Chain lubricant</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Remove the Old Cable</h2>

<p>The first step in the process is to remove the old cable from the derailleur. Begin by using the cable cutters to cut the cable near the derailleur. Next, use a screwdriver to remove the cable from the derailleur. Once the cable has been removed, make sure that the derailleur is free of any debris or dirt.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the High and Low Limit Screws</h2>

<p>The next step is to adjust the high and low limit screws on the derailleur. These screws are located at the back of the derailleur and are used to adjust the maximum and minimum sizes of the chainrings. To adjust the high limit screw, turn the screw clockwise until it stops. To adjust the low limit screw, turn the screw counterclockwise until it stops.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the B-Tension Screw</h2>

<p>The B-tension screw is used to adjust the tension of the chain on the largest chainring. To adjust the B-tension screw, turn the screw clockwise until it stops. Make sure that the chain is still able to move freely between the chainrings.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Install the New Cable</h2>

<p>The next step is to install the new cable. Use the cable ties to secure the new cable to the derailleur. Make sure that the cable is routed correctly and that it is not kinked or twisted. Once the cable is installed, use the Allen key to adjust the cable tension. Turn the Allen key clockwise until the chain shifts smoothly and accurately between the chainrings.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Lubricate the Chain</h2>

<p>The final step is to lubricate the chain. Use a chain lubricant to lubricate the chain. Apply the lubricant liberally to all of the links in the chain and make sure that it is evenly distributed. This will help to ensure that the chain shifts smoothly and accurately between the chainrings.</p>
