<h2>What is Bandit Camp?</h2>

In the game, players are tasked with scavenging for resources to build bases, craft weapons, and fight off enemy players and wildlife. With the Bandit Camp Update, players can now find a special area on the map that is filled with bandits. Your goal is to clear out the camp, which will give you rewards and resources.

<h2>How Long is the Timer for Bandit Camp?</h2>

The timer for Bandit Camp is 20 minutes long. This means that you have 20 minutes to clear the camp and collect all of the rewards before the mission fails. The timer will start as soon as you enter the camp and will not reset until you leave the camp or the mission fails.

<h2>Tips for Completing Bandit Camp Within the Time Limit</h2>

While 20 minutes may seem like a long time, it can go by quickly when you’re trying to clear out a Bandit Camp. To make sure you complete the mission within the allotted time, here are some tips:

When you enter the camp, take a few moments to plan out your strategy. Take note of where the guards are located, the layout of the camp, and any resources you may need. This will help ensure that you don’t waste any time trying to figure out what to do once you’re inside the camp.

<h3>Focus on the Objective</h3>

Once you’ve entered the camp, focus on the objective. Don’t get sidetracked by exploring or collecting resources. The faster you complete the mission, the more rewards you will be able to collect.
