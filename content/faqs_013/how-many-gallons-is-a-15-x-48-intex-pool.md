<p>An Intex pool is a great way to enjoy swimming in the comfort of your own backyard. They come in a variety of sizes, and one of the most popular is the 15 x 48 Intex pool. But before you can fill your pool and begin swimming, you need to know just how many gallons of water it will hold.</p>

<p>The good news is that it is relatively easy to calculate the amount of water your Intex pool will hold. All you need to know is the size of the pool and the average depth. Once you have this information, you can use a simple formula to calculate the number of gallons in your pool.</p>

<h2>How to Calculate the Number of Gallons in a 15 x 48 Intex Pool</h2>

<p>The formula for calculating the number of gallons in a swimming pool is fairly straightforward. All you need to do is multiply the length, width, and average depth of the pool together and then multiply that number by 7.5. This will give you the number of gallons in your 15 x 48 Intex pool.</p>

<p>For example, if the average depth of your pool is three feet, the equation would look like this: 15 x 48 x 3 x 7.5 = 8100. This means that your 15 x 48 Intex pool holds 8100 gallons of water.</p>

<h2>Calculating the Capacity of Other Sized Pools</h2>

<p>The same formula can be used to calculate the number of gallons in any size pool. All you need to do is adjust the numbers to reflect the size of the pool and the average depth. For example, if you have a 12 x 36 Intex pool with an average depth of three feet, the equation would look like this: 12 x 36 x 3 x 7.5 = 5400. This means that the 12 x 36 Intex pool holds 5400 gallons of water.</p>

<h2>Calculating the Capacity of a Pool with an Irregular Shape</h2>

<p>If your pool is not a standard shape, such as an oval or a kidney-shaped pool, the equation becomes a bit more complicated. In this case, you will need to measure the longest, widest, and deepest points of the pool and then calculate the average depth. Once you have these measurements, you can use the same formula to calculate the number of gallons in the pool.</p>

<h2>Calculating the Capacity of a Pool with Steps</h2>

<p>If your pool has steps or benches, you will need to calculate the number of gallons for each section separately. To do this, you will need to measure the length, width, and average depth of each section and then calculate the number of gallons for each section using the same formula. Once you have calculated the number of gallons for each section, you can add them together to get the total number of gallons in your pool.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Calculating the number of gallons in an Intex pool is relatively easy, and it is important to know how many gallons of water your pool holds in order to maintain the proper water balance. By using the formula above, you can easily calculate the number of gallons in a 15 x 48 Intex pool, as well as any other size or shape pool.</p>
