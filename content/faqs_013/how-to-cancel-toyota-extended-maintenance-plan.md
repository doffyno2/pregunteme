<h2>What is a Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan?</h2>

The Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan (TEM) is a special service contract offered by Toyota that covers regular routine maintenance and service items on new and certified pre-owned Toyota vehicles. This plan is an optional add-on that extends the coverage of your vehicle beyond the standard factory warranty. It is designed to help you keep your vehicle in top running condition for as long as you own it.

<h2>What Does the Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan Cover?</h2>

The Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan covers oil and filter changes, tire rotation, cabin air filter replacement, brake inspection and service, battery replacement, and other scheduled maintenance services. It also provides coverage for certain wear and tear items, such as engine belts and hoses, wiper blades, brake pads, and other parts that may need to be replaced due to normal wear and tear. 

<h2>When Does the Plan Begin and End?</h2>

Your Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan will begin when you purchase it and will end when the specified mileage or time limit is reached. The plan is typically offered in two- or four-year plans and can be purchased at any time during the life of your vehicle. 

<h2>Can I Transfer the Plan?</h2>

Yes, the Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan is transferable to subsequent owners of your vehicle. The transfer fee is typically a small percentage of the original purchase price. 

<h2>Is the Plan Worth the Cost?</h2>

The Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan can be a great value for those who plan to keep their vehicle for an extended period of time. It provides coverage for regular maintenance services, as well as wear and tear items, that could be expensive to repair or replace out of pocket. The cost of the plan can be recouped over time by avoiding costly repairs and by prolonging the life of your vehicle. 

<h2>How Do I Cancel My Plan?</h2>

If you decide to cancel your Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan, you can do so at any time. You can cancel the plan in writing by sending a letter to Toyota Financial Services. Your written request should include your name, address, vehicle identification number (VIN), and the reason you are cancelling the plan. After your request is received, you will receive a refund for any unused portion of the plan. 

<h2>What if I Have Questions?</h2>

If you have any questions about your Toyota Extended Maintenance Plan, you can contact your local Toyota dealership or customer service at Toyota Financial Services.
