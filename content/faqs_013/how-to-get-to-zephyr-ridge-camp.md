<p>Getting to Zephyr Ridge Camp can be a bit of a challenge, but it is well worth the effort. The camp is located in the Cascade Mountains, about four hours from Seattle. It is an ideal location for camping, hiking, and other outdoor activities. To get there, you'll need to drive through the towns of Leavenworth and Entiat, and then up a winding road that leads to the camp. Here's how to get to Zephyr Ridge Camp.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Driving to Leavenworth</h2>

<p>From Seattle, head east on I-90 for about 2 hours until you reach the town of Leavenworth. Once you reach Leavenworth, you will need to turn onto US-2/97 and head north. This will take you through the towns of Entiat and East Wenatchee before you reach the camp. The road is winding but it is well marked and easy to follow.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Turning onto the Zephyr Ridge Road</h2>

<p>Once you reach East Wenatchee, you will need to turn onto the Zephyr Ridge Road. This road is not well marked, so make sure you watch for the sign. The road will take you through a few small towns, and then it will start to climb up into the mountains. This is the most challenging part of the drive, as the road is narrow and winding. Be sure to take it slow and pay attention to the road.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Reaching the Campground</h2>

<p>Once you reach the top of the ridge, you will see the campground. It is a large, open area with plenty of parking. There are also several trails that lead down from the campground to the lake. You can park near the entrance and then take one of the trails down to the lake. This is a great way to get to the camp without having to take the long drive up the ridge.</p>
