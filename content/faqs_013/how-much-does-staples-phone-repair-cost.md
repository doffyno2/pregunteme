<h2>How Much Does Phone Repair Cost at Staples?</h2>

<p>The cost of phone repair services at Staples will depend on the type of phone, the specific issue that needs to be addressed, and the parts and labour needed to complete the repair. The cost of replacing a cracked screen or a faulty battery, for example, is usually much less than the cost of replacing a faulty camera lens or a broken speaker.</p>

<p>In general, a screen repair at Staples will cost between $70 and $100, depending on the model of the phone and the type of screen. Repairs for other issues, such as faulty batteries or broken speakers, usually cost between $50 and $150.</p>
