<p>When it comes to sunglasses, nothing beats a pair of real glass sunglasses. Not only do they provide superior protection from the sun’s UV rays, but they are also incredibly durable and stylish. But how much does a pair of real glass sunglasses actually weigh?</p>

<p>The answer depends on a couple of factors, including the lens type, frame material, and coating. Generally speaking, real glass sunglasses tend to weigh between 25 and 40 grams, depending on the type of lens and frame. Thicker lenses and frames made of metal or plastic will weigh more than thinner lenses and frames made of acetate or stainless steel.</p>

For example, high-index glass lenses can be as light as 15 grams, while CR-39 lenses can weigh up to 30 grams. Additionally, the type of coating used on the lenses can also affect the weight. Anti-reflective coatings, for example, can add a few extra grams to the overall weight of the glasses.</p>
