<p>If you have recently undergone a meniscus repair surgery, you may be wondering how soon you can resume everyday activities like climbing stairs. After a torn meniscus repair, you may need to take extra care when climbing stairs since the meniscus is responsible for giving the knee joint extra stability. This article will discuss the steps you should take to ensure a safe return to stair climbing after your meniscus repair.</p>

<h2>What Is a Meniscus Tear?</h2>

<p>The meniscus is a C-shaped cartilage that is located between the thighbone (femur) and shinbone (tibia). It works to absorb shock and provide stability to the knee joint. The meniscus can tear due to overuse, age, or sudden injury. When this happens, you may experience pain, swelling, and a feeling of instability in the knee. If your doctor suspects a meniscus tear, they may recommend an MRI or arthroscopic surgery to confirm the diagnosis and repair the tear.</p>

<p>After a meniscus tear repair surgery, it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions for a full recovery. You may need to rest your knee for a certain period of time, and you may also need to use a brace to support your knee while it heals. In addition, you may need physical therapy to help strengthen the knee and regain full range of motion.</p>

<h2>When Can You Climb Stairs After Meniscus Repair Surgery?</h2>

<p>Climbing stairs can put extra strain on the knee joint, so it is important to wait until your doctor says it is safe to resume activities like stair climbing. Depending on the severity of the tear, you may need to wait anywhere from 4 weeks to 6 months before attempting to climb stairs. After your doctor gives you the go-ahead, you should start slowly and progress gradually, making sure to keep your knee braced if necessary.</p>
