<p>Traeger grills are one of the most popular and versatile outdoor cooking appliances on the market. These grills are designed to provide users with a wide range of cooking options, from slow-cooking to high-temperature searing. One of the key features of Traeger grills is the use of wood pellets for fuel. But how much pellets does a Traeger grill use?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on several factors, including the size of the grill, the type of food being cooked, and the desired cooking temperature. Generally speaking, a Traeger grill will use between one and two pounds of pellets per hour when cooking at medium to low temperatures. If the grill is being used to sear food at high temperatures, the amount of pellets used will increase. For example, a Traeger grill may use as much as three to four pounds of pellets per hour during a high-temperature searing session.</p>

<p>When using a Traeger grill, it is important to remember that the amount of pellets used will vary depending on the type of food being cooked. For example, fatty meats such as bacon will require more pellets than lean meats such as chicken. Additionally, the amount of pellets used will also increase if the grill is being used to smoke food. In these cases, the grill may use up to three to four pounds of pellets per hour.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the amount of pellets used can also be affected by the type of pellets being used. Premium pellets such as Traeger's own brand are designed to burn more efficiently, meaning that they will require less fuel to reach the desired cooking temperature. Conversely, generic pellets will require more fuel to reach the same temperature.</p>

<p>In general, it is recommended that Traeger grill owners purchase enough pellets to last them for several cooking sessions. This will ensure that they have enough fuel to reach their desired cooking temperature and also reduce the chances of running out of pellets mid-cooking session. Depending on the size of the grill and the frequency of use, Traeger owners may need to purchase anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds of pellets per month.</p>

<h2>How to Store Traeger Grill Pellets</h2>

<p>In order to ensure that Traeger grill pellets remain in optimal condition, it is important to store them in a cool, dry place. Pellets that are stored in a damp environment can absorb moisture and become difficult to light, resulting in a poor cooking experience. Additionally, it is important to store pellets in an airtight container to prevent them from becoming stale.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that pellets should not be stored for extended periods of time. Pellets that are stored for more than two months may start to degrade, resulting in a decrease in their burning efficiency. For this reason, it is best to purchase pellets in smaller quantities, allowing you to enjoy the best possible cooking experience.</p>
