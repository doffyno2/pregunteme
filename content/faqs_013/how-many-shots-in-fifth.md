<p>Have you ever wondered how many shots are in a fifth of liquor? The answer depends on the type of liquor and the size of the bottle. A fifth is equal to 25.6 ounces, or 750 milliliters. This is the standard size for a bottle of hard liquor. A fifth is also known as a "fifth of liquor," or simply a "fifth."</p>

<p>If you're asking how many shots in a fifth of vodka, the answer is 17. A fifth of vodka is equal to 25.6 ounces, or 750 milliliters. This is the standard size for a bottle of vodka. A single shot of vodka is 1.5 ounces, or 44 milliliters. So, if you divide the total volume of vodka by the volume of a single shot, you get 17 shots in a fifth of vodka.</p>

<p>It's a little different with other types of hard liquor. For example, a fifth of whiskey is equal to 25.6 ounces, or 750 milliliters. But a single shot of whiskey is only 1.25 ounces, or 37 milliliters. So, if you divide the total volume of whiskey by the volume of a single shot, you get 20 shots in a fifth of whiskey.</p>

<p>The same formula holds true for other types of hard liquor. For example, a fifth of rum is equal to 25.6 ounces, or 750 milliliters. But a single shot of rum is only 1.5 ounces, or 44 milliliters. So, if you divide the total volume of rum by the volume of a single shot, you get 17 shots in a fifth of rum.</p>

But a single shot of whiskey is only 1.25 ounces, or 37 milliliters. So, if you have a bottle of whiskey that is slightly larger or smaller than the standard size, the number of shots in a fifth will vary accordingly.</p>
