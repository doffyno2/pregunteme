Nathan hydration bladders are an essential piece of equipment for runners and hikers. They are designed to keep you hydrated during long workouts or hikes. With their lightweight and compact design, they can be easily secured to your backpack or waist belt. But how do you fill and use a Nathan hydration bladder? In this article, we will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to fill your Nathan hydration bladder.

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Bladder for Filling</h2>

Before you fill your Nathan hydration bladder, you need to prepare it. Begin by removing the cap from the bladder. Then, remove the bite valve from the bladder. If your bladder has a tube, disconnect it from the bladder and set it aside.

<h2>Step 2: Fill the Bladder </h2>

Once your Nathan hydration bladder is prepared, you can begin to fill it. First, fill the bladder with clean water. Make sure to fill it up to the “fill” line indicated on the bladder. Once the bladder is full, you can add sports drinks or electrolyte supplements if desired. If you do add sports drinks or other supplements, make sure to use the correct ratio of water to supplement.

<h2>Step 3: Secure the Bite Valve</h2>

After you have filled your bladder, it’s time to secure the bite valve. To do this, reattach the bite valve to the bladder and make sure it is securely fastened. Once the bite valve is secured, you can move on to the next step.

<h2>Step 4: Attach the Tube (If Applicable)</h2>

If your Nathan hydration bladder has a tube, you will need to attach it to the bladder. To do this, simply insert one end of the tube into the bladder and secure it with the clips provided. Once the tube is attached, you are ready to use your bladder.

<h2>Step 5: Secure the Bladder to Your Backpack or Waist Belt</h2>

The final step is to secure the Nathan hydration bladder to your backpack or waist belt. If you are using a backpack, the bladder should be secured to the shoulder straps. If you are using a waist belt, make sure to secure the bladder in the middle of the belt. Once the bladder is secure, you are ready to use it.
