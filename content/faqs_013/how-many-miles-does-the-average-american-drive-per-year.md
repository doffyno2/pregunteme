<p>The amount of miles that the average American drives in a year varies depending on factors such as age, location, and vehicle type. However, the overall average for all Americans is approximately 13,500 miles per year. This number can vary greatly depending on many factors.</p>

<h2>Factors That Influence How Many Miles Americans Drive Per Year</h2>

Additionally, people who live in states with harsher climates may not be able to drive as much in the winter if roads are icy or snow-covered. Age is also a factor that can influence the number of miles driven in a year. Generally, younger people tend to drive more miles than older people, as younger people may have more errands to run, attend more social events, or have longer commutes to work.</p>

<p>The type of vehicle an individual drives can also influence the number of miles driven in a year. For example, electric cars may get fewer miles per year than gasoline-powered cars due to their limited range.

<h2>Cost of Driving </h2>

<p>The cost of driving is another factor that can influence how many miles an individual drives in a year. Gas prices, insurance costs, and maintenance costs can all add up to create a substantial expense that may limit the number of miles driven.
