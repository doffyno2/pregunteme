<p>GitHub is the world’s most popular version control system, and it’s used by millions of developers worldwide. But, did you know that you can make your GitHub repositories public or private? This guide will show you how to change your private repository to public, so anyone can find and view your code.</p>

<h2>What is a Repository?</h2>

<p>Before we dive into how to change a repo from private to public, let’s take a moment to review what a repository is. A repository is a collection of files related to a project. For example, if you’re writing a book, you might have a repository that contains all the text, images, and other files related to your book. In GitHub, you can create multiple repositories for different projects, and you can make them public or private.</p>

<h2>The Difference between Public and Private Repositories</h2>

<p>Public repositories are visible to everyone, and anyone can access your code and make changes. Private repositories, however, are only visible to you and the people you invite, so you can keep your code secure. Private repositories are perfect for projects you don’t want to share with the world, or if you’re working on a project with a team.</p>

<h2>How to Change a Repository from Private to Public</h2>

<p>If you’ve decided that you want to make your repo public, the process is simple. Here’s what you need to do:</p>

<h3>1. Log in to GitHub</h3>

<p>The first step is to log in to your GitHub account. If you don’t already have an account, you can create one for free.</p>

<h3>2. Find the Repository</h3>

<p>Once you’re logged in, you can find the repository you want to make public. You can find it by clicking on “Your Repositories” in the top right corner of the page.</p>

<h3>3. Change the Repository Settings</h3>

<p>Once you’ve found the repository, you can click on “Settings”. On the settings page, you’ll find the “Visibility” section. Here, you can choose whether you want to make the repository public or private.</p>

<h3>4. Confirm the Changes</h3>

<p>Once you’ve selected “Public”, you’ll need to confirm the changes. Click on “Save Changes” to make the repository public.</p>
