<p>When it comes to running an RV air conditioner, it's important to know how many watts it takes to get the job done. The amount of watts needed will depend on the size of the air conditioner and the amount of BTUs it produces. However, knowing the wattage it takes to run an RV air conditioner will help you to make sure your RV has the necessary power to run it. </p>

<h2>How Does An RV Air Conditioner Work?</h2>

<p>An RV air conditioner operates on the same principles as any other air conditioner. It works by cooling the air within the RV by drawing in warm air from outside and then expelling the cooled air back into the RV. This is done by using a refrigerant that absorbs heat from the air and then releases it outside through a coil. The coil helps to release the heat and cool the air down. The cooled air is then pushed back into the RV through the fan. </p>

<h2>What Size Air Conditioner Do I Need For My RV?</h2>

<p>The size of the air conditioner you need for your RV will depend on the size of your RV. The larger the RV, the bigger the air conditioner you will need. A good way to determine the size of the air conditioner is to look at the BTU rating. The higher the BTU rating, the more power the air conditioner will require. In general, a 15,000 BTU air conditioner is sufficient for most RV’s. </p>

<h2>How Many Watts Does An RV Air Conditioner Use?</h2>

<p>The amount of watts an RV air conditioner uses will depend on the size and BTU rating of the air conditioner. Generally, an RV air conditioner will require between 1,100 and 1,400 watts. This means that a 15,000 BTU air conditioner will require around 1,400 watts to operate. </p>

<h2>What Else Do I Need To Run An RV Air Conditioner?</h2>

<p>In addition to the air conditioner, you will need a power source that can provide enough power to run the air conditioner. Generally, this will be a generator or an RV battery. If you are using a generator, you will need to make sure it is powerful enough and has the necessary wattage to run the air conditioner. If you are using an RV battery, you will need to make sure it has the necessary capacity to run the air conditioner. </p>

<h2>What Else Do I Need To Know About Running An RV Air Conditioner?</h2>

<p>In addition to knowing how many watts an RV air conditioner uses, you will also need to make sure you have the proper ventilation to allow the unit to function properly. This means you should make sure your RV has an adequate amount of ventilation to allow the warm air to escape and be replaced with cool air. You should also make sure all vents are open and that you have the correct size filters for your RV. </p>
