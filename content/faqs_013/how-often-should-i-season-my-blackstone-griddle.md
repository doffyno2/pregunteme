<p>If you own a Blackstone griddle, you know it requires special care and maintenance to keep it in optimal condition. This griddle is a great choice for outdoor cooking, but it needs to be seasoned and cared for properly. The best way to ensure your griddle stays in top condition is by following the manufacturer's instructions for seasoning and maintenance. Here, you'll learn how often to season your Blackstone griddle, how to do it properly, and other tips for keeping it in good shape.</p>

<h2>Why Season Your Blackstone Griddle?</h2>

<p>Seasoning your Blackstone griddle is important because it helps protect the surface from rust, prevents sticking, and keeps food from sticking to the surface. Seasoning your griddle also helps it last longer and maintain its non-stick surface. Seasoning your griddle is a simple process, but it's important to do it regularly in order to keep your griddle in peak condition.</p>

<h2>How Often Should You Season Your Blackstone Griddle?</h2>

<p>You should season your Blackstone griddle every time you use it. This means you should season it before the first use and after every use. It's important to season the griddle before and after each use because this will help protect the surface and keep it in top condition. If you don't season your griddle after each use, the surface will become worn down and it won't be as non-stick as it should be.</p>

<h2>How to Season Your Blackstone Griddle?</h2>

<p>Seasoning your Blackstone griddle is a simple process. First, heat the griddle to the highest temperature setting. Once it's hot, turn it off and allow it to cool down for a few minutes. Next, apply a thin layer of cooking oil, such as vegetable, canola, or peanut oil, to the surface of the griddle. Use a spatula or a paper towel to spread the oil evenly across the surface. Finally, turn the griddle back on to the highest temperature setting and let it heat up for 5-10 minutes. Once the griddle is hot, turn it off and allow it to cool down before using it.</p>

<h2>Other Tips for Caring for Your Blackstone Griddle</h2>

<p>In addition to seasoning your Blackstone griddle, there are a few other things you can do to keep it in top condition. After each use, it's important to clean the surface of the griddle with a damp cloth or paper towel. This will remove any food debris and oil that may have accumulated during cooking. Make sure to avoid using abrasive scrubbers on the griddle, as this can damage the surface. Additionally, it's important to store your Blackstone griddle in a dry place when not in use. This will help prevent rust from forming on the surface.</p>
