Uhaul is one of the most popular and well-known moving companies in the United States. They offer a variety of services, including truck rentals, storage, and packing supplies. One of the most common questions that people have when renting a Uhaul truck is how much they will be charged for gas. In this article, we will answer this question and provide some helpful tips on how to save money when renting a Uhaul.

<h2>How Much Does Uhaul Charge for Gas?</h2>

The amount that Uhaul charges for gas will depend on the size of the truck that you are renting. Generally speaking, Uhaul charges an additional fee for fuel for all of their trucks, regardless of the size. The fee is calculated based on the estimated miles that the truck will be driven and the current market rate for gasoline. 

For example, if you are renting a 10-foot truck, Uhaul will charge an additional fee of $0.89/mile. This fee is based on the estimated miles that you will drive the truck and the current market rate for gasoline. For a 20-foot truck, the fee is $1.09/mile. For a 26-foot truck, the fee is $1.19/mile.

<h2>What Can I Do to Save Money on Uhaul Gas?</h2>

Fortunately, there are several ways that you can save money on Uhaul gas. First, make sure to plan your route ahead of time. This will help you to estimate the number of miles that you will be driving and get a better idea of how much gas you will need.
