<p>Bitterness can be a very unpleasant flavor in food that can easily ruin a meal. Itâ€™s not always easy to identify the cause, but there are a few common culprits including over-boiled vegetables, strong spices, and overly acidic ingredients. Fortunately, there are some simple techniques that can be used to counteract the bitterness in food and make it more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Why Is Food Bitter?</h2>

<p>Bitterness in food is caused by compounds known as tannins and alkaloids. Tannins occur naturally in vegetables such as spinach, artichokes, and kale and can be released if they are cooked for too long. Alkaloids are found in certain spices such as black pepper, cayenne, and nutmeg and can be released when they are used in excess. Acidic ingredients such as vinegar and citrus juice can also cause food to become bitter.</p>
