<p>Shooting stars, also known as meteors, are spectacular celestial events that can be seen from Earth. They appear as bright streaks of light in the night sky, and can be breathtakingly beautiful. But how long do shooting stars last?</p>

<p>Shooting stars are actually pieces of dust, rock, or ice from outer space that enter the Earth’s atmosphere and burn up. The bright streak of light you see is caused by the dust, rock, or ice burning up as it passes through the atmosphere. As a result, shooting stars are very short-lived, lasting only a few seconds. While some meteors can be seen with the naked eye, most are too small and faint to be seen.</p>

<p>The speed at which shooting stars travel is also a factor in how long they last. Most shooting stars travel at speeds between 11 and 72 kilometers per second. The faster they travel, the shorter their lifespan. At the slower speeds, shooting stars can last up to a few seconds before they burn up, while at the faster speeds they can last as little as a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>The size of the shooting star also plays a role in how long it lasts. Smaller meteors burn up faster than larger ones, and the larger ones can last up to several seconds before burning up.</p>

<p>The color of the shooting star can also tell us how long it lasted. Shooting stars that appear yellow or orange tend to last longer than shooting stars that appear blue or white. This is because the yellow and orange colors are caused by the meteors burning up at a slower speed.</p>

<h2>How Can You See Shooting Stars?</h2>

<p>Shooting stars can be seen with the naked eye, although they can be hard to spot because of their short lifespan and faint brightness. To increase your chances of spotting one, it’s best to go out on a clear night away from light pollution. Look for a dark patch of sky, and wait for a shooting star to appear. It may take a few minutes, but you’re sure to spot one eventually!</p>

<p>If you want to increase your chances of seeing a shooting star, you can also visit a meteor shower. A meteor shower is a natural phenomenon in which large numbers of meteors appear in the night sky. Meteor showers happen periodically throughout the year, and you can find out when one is due by checking online.</p>

<h2>How Do You Photograph Shooting Stars?</h2>

<p>If you want to capture a shooting star on camera, it’s best to use a digital camera. Set your camera to a long exposure, and point it at a dark patch of sky. You should also use a tripod to keep your camera steady. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to capture a beautiful image of a shooting star!</p>
