Pepper spray is a common tool used for self-defense. It is an effective way to deter attackers and can help keep you safe in dangerous situations. Unfortunately, even when used properly, pepper spray can cause a mess. If you are ever in a situation where you have to use pepper spray, it is important to know how to clean up the mess afterwards.
