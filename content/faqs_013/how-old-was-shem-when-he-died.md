<p>Shem, the eldest son of Noah and a descendant of Adam, is remembered as one of the three sons of Noah mentioned in the Bible. Born before the flood, Shem is credited with helping to save mankind from the great flood by building the ark, as well as being the ancestor of the Semitic people. But how old was Shem when he died?</p>

<p>The exact age of Shem is not recorded in the Bible, however it is possible to make an educated guess. Shem is recorded as having lived 502 years after the birth of his youngest brother, Japheth, and most Biblical scholars agree that Shem was the eldest son of Noah. Taking this into consideration, it is most likely that Shem was born before the great flood, and therefore would have been at least 600 years old when he died.</p>

<p>Shem was a faithful man of God and was said to have been blessed by God. The Bible records that God made a special covenant with Shem and his descendants, saying that they would be blessed and that their descendants would inherit the land of Israel. This covenant could be seen as an indication of the great respect and blessing that God had for Shem.</p>

<p>Not only is Shem credited with helping to build the ark, but he is also credited with being the ancestor of the Semitic people. Shem was a descendant of Abraham, who was the father of Isaac, and the grandfather of Jacob, who was renamed Israel. Through these three men, Shem and his descendants became the ancestors of the Semitic peoples, which include the Jews, Arabs, and Assyrians.</p>

<p>After the great flood, Shem and his brothers, Japheth and Ham, are said to have gone their separate ways. Shem and his descendants settled in the area around Canaan, while Japheth settled in Europe and Ham settled in Africa. It is believed that Shem and his descendants eventually settled in what is now Israel, and that his descendants are the ancestors of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>The Bible does not record an exact age for Shem when he died, however it is believed that he was at least 600 years old. This would make Shem the oldest recorded person in history, as well as one of the most important figures in Biblical history.</p>
