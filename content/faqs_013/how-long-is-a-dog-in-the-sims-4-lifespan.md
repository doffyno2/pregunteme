The Sims 4 is a popular life simulation game that allows players to create a virtual world and explore the lives of their Sims. One of the options players have when creating their Sims is to add a pet to their household. One of the most popular pet choices is a dog, and one of the questions many players have is how long a dog in The Sims 4 will live. 

<h2>The Average Dog Lifespan in The Sims 4</h2>

The average lifespan of a dog in The Sims 4 is approximately 10 Sim days. This is determined by the age of the dog when it is added to the household. If the dog is a puppy when it is added, it will grow to adulthood in 10 days, and then immediately begin aging. If the dog is an adult when it is added, it will begin aging immediately and will live for an average of 10 days. 

<h2>How To Increase a Dog’s Lifespan in The Sims 4</h2>

Players who want to keep their Sims’ dog for longer than the average 10 day lifespan can do a few things to increase its lifespan. The first is to purchase the “Lifetime Happiness” reward. This reward can be purchased with Lifetime Happiness points, which can be earned by completing tasks and goals. Once purchased, this reward will cause the dog’s lifespan to increase by half, giving it an extra 5 days.

The second way to increase a dog’s lifespan in The Sims 4 is to keep it well fed and entertained. If the dog is well taken care of, it will live longer than the average 10 days. Feeding the dog high-quality food and playing with it regularly will help it to stay healthy and live longer. 

<h2>The Effects of Aging on a Dog’s Lifespan in The Sims 4</h2>

Once a dog reaches adulthood in The Sims 4, it will begin to age. This aging process will affect the dog’s lifespan, as older dogs tend to live shorter lives than younger dogs. As the dog ages, it will become slower and less active. It will also require more care from its owner in order to stay healthy and happy. 

<h2>What Happens When a Dog Dies in The Sims 4?</h2>

When a dog dies in The Sims 4, its body will appear in the household and a tombstone will appear in the family inventory. The tombstone can be placed in the home as a memorial to the dog, or it can be sold for a small amount of money. The dog’s body can also be taken to the pet cemetery and buried there. 

<h2>Can a Dog Be Brought Back to Life in The Sims 4?</h2>

Unfortunately, there is no way to bring a deceased dog back to life in The Sims 4. However, players can purchase the “Ressurect-O-Nomitron” reward with Lifetime Happiness points. This reward will allow the player to bring any deceased Sim or pet back to life, but it can only be used once per household.
