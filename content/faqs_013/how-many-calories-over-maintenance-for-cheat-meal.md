Cheat meals are an important part of any diet plan. They can help to keep you motivated and on track with your goals, as well as give you an occasional opportunity to indulge in something you wouldn’t normally eat. But in order to make sure that your cheat meal is as beneficial as possible, you need to know how many calories you should be eating over your maintenance levels.

<h2>What is a Cheat Meal?</h2>

A cheat meal is an indulgent meal that you allow yourself to enjoy on a regular basis. It is usually something that is high in calories and fat, such as pizza, ice cream, or burgers. Cheat meals should be planned ahead of time and should not become a regular part of your diet.

The idea behind a cheat meal is that it gives you a break from your regular diet and gives you something to look forward to. It can also help to keep you on track with your diet, as it gives you something to look forward to at the end of the week.

<h2>How Many Calories Over Maintenance for Cheat Meal?</h2>

The number of calories you should eat over your maintenance levels for a cheat meal depends on a few different factors. First, you need to consider your goals.
