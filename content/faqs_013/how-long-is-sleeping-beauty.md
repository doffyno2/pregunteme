<p>When it comes to classic fairytales, few are more beloved than the story of Sleeping Beauty. Written by Charles Perrault in 1697, the tale of a beautiful young princess who falls asleep for a hundred years under a spell has enchanted generations of children and adults alike. But how long was Sleeping Beauty actually asleep?</p>

<p>Most versions of the story give a definitive answer: Sleeping Beauty was asleep for one hundred years. Upon her awakening, the kingdom she had left behind had changed dramatically. The castle was in disrepair and the surrounding area had become a forest. In some versions of the story, Sleeping Beauty's parents had died and her children had grown to adulthood in her absence.</p>

<p>However, the exact duration of Sleeping Beauty's sleep is open to interpretation. The original story by Charles Perrault does not give a definitive number of years. Instead, it states that Sleeping Beauty was awakened by a king's son after “a hundred years or more” had passed. Some versions of the story have changed this to a more specific number, while others have kept the ambiguous wording intact.</p>

<p>In addition to the lack of a definitive answer, there are other interpretations of Sleeping Beauty's sleep. In some versions of the story, the sleeping princess does not age or age very slowly during her slumber. This means that she may have been asleep for longer than one hundred years, but only looked as if she had been asleep for one hundred years. The exact details vary depending on the version of the story being told.</p>

<p>The concept of time in the story of Sleeping Beauty also varies from version to version. In some versions, time passes in the blink of an eye while the prince is searching for the sleeping princess, while in other versions time passes slowly and the prince searches for many years. This ambiguity adds another layer to the interpretation of Sleeping Beauty's sleep.</p>

<h2>What is the Moral of the Story?</h2>

<p>In addition to being a beloved fairytale, the story of Sleeping Beauty is also a cautionary tale about the dangers of breaking promises. The prince in the story breaks his promise to the fairy godmother by not attending the christening of Sleeping Beauty. This results in the princess being cursed to sleep for one hundred years.</p>

<p>The story serves as a warning against making rash promises and breaking them. It also highlights the importance of making wise decisions and sticking to them. The story of Sleeping Beauty also has a strong element of faith, as the prince believes the prophecy of the fairy godmother and continues searching for the sleeping princess until he finds her.</p>

<h2>How has Sleeping Beauty Been Retold?</h2>
