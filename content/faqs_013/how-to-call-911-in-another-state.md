<p>In the event of an emergency, many of us rely on 911 to get the help we need. But if you find yourself in an unfamiliar state, you may be unsure of how to contact emergency services. Fortunately, it’s easy to call 911 in another state, thanks to the nationwide 911 system.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Nationwide 911 System</h2>

<p>The nationwide 911 system is a free, nationwide emergency service. It is available in all fifty states, as well as most U.S. territories. You can call 911 from any phone, including a landline, cell phone, or VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone. If you are calling from a landline, you will need to provide the address of your current location. If you are calling from a cell phone, your location will be automatically identified. This is known as Enhanced 911 (E911) service.</p>

<h2>Making a 911 Call in Another State</h2>

<p>When you call 911 in another state, the call will be directed to the local emergency services. Depending on the state, the call will be routed to the local police, fire department, or both. In some states, 911 calls are automatically routed to a central dispatch center. In others, they may be routed to the local police or fire department.</p>

<p>When you call 911 in another state, it is important to be as clear and concise as possible. Provide the operator with as much information as possible about your current location and the type of emergency. Be prepared to provide your name and contact information. If you don’t know your exact location, provide the closest intersection, landmark, or address.</p>

<h2>How to Reach Emergency Services if You Can’t Call 911</h2>

<p>In some cases, you may not be able to call 911. For example, if you are in an area with no cell phone signal, or if you are using a VoIP phone without an active 911 account. In these cases, you can call the local non-emergency police or fire department number. You can usually find the non-emergency number listed on the local police or fire department website.</p>

<h2>What to Do After You Call 911</h2>

<p>After you have made the call, stay on the line until the operator tells you it is safe to hang up. Follow any instructions the operator gives you. If you need to leave the area, do so quickly and calmly, following the operator’s instructions. If you can, provide the operator with updates on your whereabouts until help arrives.</p>
