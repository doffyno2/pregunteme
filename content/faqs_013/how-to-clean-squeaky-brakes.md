<h2>What Causes Squeaky Brakes?</h2>
Squeaky brakes are usually caused by a build-up of dust, dirt, and grime on the brake pads. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as driving in wet or muddy conditions, or simply by not cleaning the brakes regularly. As the brake pads become dirtier, they become less effective, leading to audible squeaking when the brakes are applied.

<h2>How to Clean Squeaky Brakes</h2>
In order to tackle squeaky brakes, it is important to clean them regularly to prevent a build-up of grime. The following steps provide a comprehensive guide to cleaning squeaky brakes safely and effectively.

<h3>Step 1: Remove the Wheels</h3>
The first step is to remove the wheels from the vehicle. This can be done by jacking up the car and removing the wheel nuts before taking off the wheel. Once the wheel has been removed, it is important to inspect the brake pads for signs of wear and damage.

<h3>Step 2: Clean the Brakes</h3>
Once the wheels are removed, the brake pads should be cleaned with a specialized brake cleaner. This will help to remove any dirt and debris from the pads, allowing them to function more effectively. It is important to wear protective gloves when handling the brake cleaner, and to ensure that it is only used in a well-ventilated area.

<h3>Step 3: Re-Lubricate the Brake Pads</h3>
Once the brakes have been cleaned, they should be re-lubricated in order to allow them to function more effectively. This can be done using a specialized brake lubricant, which should be applied to the brake pads and the surrounding area.

Finally, it is important to test the brakes to make sure that they are functioning correctly. This can be done by running the vehicle in a safe and controlled environment, such as a car park or a quiet road, and testing the brakes at various speeds. If the brakes squeak, then it is likely that the cleaning process was not effective and should be repeated.
