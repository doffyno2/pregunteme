<p>Two weeks is a period of time that is often used to measure how long certain events take. It is also used to measure how long certain tasks take to complete. To calculate how many days are in two weeks, you first need to understand what constitutes a "week." A week is a period of seven days. Thus, two weeks is equal to fourteen days.</p>

<p>The idea of a seven day week originated in ancient Babylon. The ancient Babylonians used a seven day week as a way of keeping track of their lives. They measured the days by the phases of the moon, and used the seven day week to divide these phases into manageable chunks. This seven day week was adopted by the Greeks and eventually spread to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The seven day week is based on a calendar cycle of seven days, which is repeated every seven days. This cycle is known as the "week cycle." The week cycle begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday. Each day in the week cycle has a specific name. Sunday is the first day, Monday is the second day, Tuesday is the third day, Wednesday is the fourth day, Thursday is the fifth day, Friday is the sixth day, and Saturday is the seventh day.</p>

<p>Since two weeks consists of fourteen days, this means that two weeks is the equivalent of two complete week cycles. The two weeks begin on a Sunday and end on a Saturday. Thus, two weeks is equal to fourteen days.</p>
