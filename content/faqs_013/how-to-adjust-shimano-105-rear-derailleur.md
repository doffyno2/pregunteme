<p>The Shimano 105 rear derailleur is an important component of the drivetrain of any bike. It is responsible for shifting the chain between the different cogs on the cassette, allowing you to select the right gear for the terrain and your riding style. In order for the derailleur to work properly, it must be adjusted correctly. This can be done relatively easily, but there are a few steps you must take in order to ensure that your bike is running at its best.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check the Derailleur Alignment</h2>

<p>The first step to adjusting a Shimano 105 rear derailleur is to make sure that it is properly aligned. To do this, you will need to check that the pulleys are in line with the cogs on the cassette. To do this, shift the derailleur so that it is in the highest gear and then check that the pulleys are parallel to the largest cog. If the pulleys are not in line, you will need to adjust the low- and high-limit screws on the derailleur until they are.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the Barrel Adjuster</h2>

<p>The next step is to adjust the barrel adjuster on the derailleur. The barrel adjuster is responsible for setting the tension of the cable, which affects how quickly the derailleur shifts between gears. To adjust the barrel adjuster, shift the derailleur to the highest gear, then turn the barrel adjuster clockwise until the derailleur shifts correctly. If the derailleur is still not shifting correctly, you may need to adjust the cable tension.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Cable Tension</h2>

<p>The cable tension is responsible for how quickly the derailleur shifts between gears. To adjust the cable tension, you will need to loosen the cable clamp bolt on the derailleur. Then, use a 5mm allen key to turn the cable tension adjuster until the derailleur shifts correctly. Once you have adjusted the cable tension, you should re-tighten the cable clamp bolt.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Check the Derailleur Limit Screws</h2>

<p>The derailleur limit screws are responsible for setting the maximum and minimum gear that the derailleur can shift to. To check the limit screws, shift the derailleur to the highest and lowest gears. If the derailleur is not shifting to the highest or lowest gears, you will need to adjust the limit screws. To do this, you will need to loosen the limit screws and then turn them clockwise until the derailleur shifts correctly.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Test the Derailleur</h2>

<p>Once you have adjusted the derailleur, you should test it to make sure that it is working correctly. To do this, you should shift the derailleur between all of the gears and make sure that it shifts smoothly and without any issues. If it does not, you may need to make further adjustments.</p>
