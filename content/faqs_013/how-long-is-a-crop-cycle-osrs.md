<p>Old School RuneScape (OSRS) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). It is a re-creation of the original RuneScape game, which was launched in 2001. Players of OSRS are given the opportunity to experience the game in its classic form and to engage in various activities such as farming, crafting, combat, and questing. The farming aspect of OSRS plays an important role in the game and provides players with many opportunities to make money and progress through the game.

<h2>What Is a Crop Cycle?</h2>

In OSRS, there are several different types of crops, and each crop has a different crop cycle. The length of the cycle depends on the type of crop and the level of Farming a player has. For example, a player with a level of 80 in Farming would have a shorter crop cycle for certain crops than a player with a level of 30 in Farming. </p>

<h2>What Are the Different Crop Cycles in OSRS?</h2>
