America is a land of natural beauty and grandeur, with towering mountain ranges that range from coast to coast. It’s no wonder that so many people flock to the US to explore its diverse and stunning landscapes. But how many mountains are actually in the US?

<h2>What is a Mountain?</h2> 

Before we can answer the question of how many mountains are in the US, it’s important to understand what we mean when we refer to a mountain.
