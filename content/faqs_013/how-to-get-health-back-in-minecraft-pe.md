<p>Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game where players build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D generated world. With its various genre-defining gameplay, Minecraft has become one of the most popular games of all time. The Pocket Edition of the game, or the mobile version, is particularly popular among younger players.</p>

<p>One of the key elements of the game is health, which is an important resource that needs to be managed correctly. If your health bar runs out, you will die and have to restart the game. So it is important to know how to get health back in Minecraft PE.</p>

<h2>What is Health in Minecraft?</h2>

<p>Health in Minecraft is measured by a heart-shaped icon that appears in the game’s HUD (Heads-Up Display). Each heart represents two points of health, and a player can have up to 20 points of health. Health is depleted when a player is attacked by mobs, falls from a high block, or is affected by certain environmental elements, such as fire or water.</p>

<p>When a player’s health reaches zero, they die and have to restart the game. This can be a major setback, especially if the player has made some progress in their current world.</p>
