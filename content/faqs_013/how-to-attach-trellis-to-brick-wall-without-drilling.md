<h2>Introduction</h2>

A trellis is a great way to add some decorative flair to your garden, and it can also provide additional support for climbing plants. However, if you’re installing a trellis against a brick wall, you’re going to need to get creative to make sure it stays secure. Drilling into a brick wall isn’t always an option, and can be very time consuming. Fortunately, there are some other methods you can use to attach your trellis to a brick wall without drilling. 

<h2>Things You'll Need</h2>

Before you get started, make sure you have the following items on hand:

<ul>
  <li>Trellis</li>
  <li>Masonry screws</li>
  <li>Masonry drill bit</li>
  <li>Cordless drill</li>
  <li>Screwdriver</li>
  <li>Wall anchors</li>
  <li>Plastic wall plugs</li>
  <li>Masonry glue</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attaching the Trellis with Masonry Screws</h2>

This is one of the most popular methods for attaching a trellis to a brick wall. Masonry screws will give you the most secure hold, and they’re relatively easy to install.

<ul>
  <li>First, you’ll need to measure the trellis and mark out the points where you want to attach it to the wall. Make sure you leave enough space between each point for the masonry screws.</li>
  <li>Next, use a masonry drill bit to drill pilot holes into the brick wall. Be sure to drill the holes a few millimeters deeper than the length of the masonry screws.</li>
  <li>Now, you can insert the masonry screws into the pilot holes. Use a cordless drill to help you tighten them in place.</li>
  <li>Finally, attach the trellis to the masonry screws using a screwdriver.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attaching the Trellis with Wall Anchors</h2>

If you don’t have access to a masonry drill bit, you can use wall anchors instead. Wall anchors are often used to hang pictures and shelves on brick walls, and they work just as well for attaching a trellis.

<ul>
  <li>First, measure out the points where you want to attach the trellis and mark them with a pencil. Make sure to leave enough space between each point for the wall anchors.</li>
  <li>Next, insert the wall anchors into the brick wall. You can use a hammer to lightly tap them in place.</li>
  <li>Now, attach the trellis to the wall anchors using screws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attaching the Trellis with Plastic Wall Plugs</h2>

If you don’t have access to masonry screws or wall anchors, you can use plastic wall plugs instead. Plastic wall plugs are great for attaching trellises to brick walls, as they provide a secure hold without damaging the brick.

<ul>
  <li>First, measure out the points where you want to attach the trellis and mark them with a pencil. Make sure to leave enough space between each point for the plastic wall plugs.</li>
  <li>Next, insert the plastic wall plugs into the brick wall. You can use a hammer to lightly tap them in place.</li>
  <li>Now, attach the trellis to the plastic wall plugs using screws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attaching the Trellis with Masonry Glue</h2>

Masonry glue is a great option if you don’t have access to any of the other items mentioned above. It’s easy to apply, and it provides a strong hold.

<ul>
  <li>First, measure out the points where you want to attach the trellis and mark them with a pencil.</li>
  <li>Next, apply masonry glue to the back of the trellis and press it firmly against the wall. Make sure the trellis is level before you let the glue dry.</li>
  <li>Finally, wait for the masonry glue to dry completely before you attempt to hang anything from the trellis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Attaching a trellis to a brick wall doesn’t have to be a difficult task. With the right tools and materials, you can easily attach your trellis to a brick wall without drilling. Whether you choose masonry screws, wall anchors, plastic wall plugs, or masonry glue, you can be sure your trellis will stay securely in place for years to come.
