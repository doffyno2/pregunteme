Flagstone patios can be a beautiful addition to any outdoor area. Not only can they add a classic and elegant look to your garden or patio, but they also provide a durable and low-maintenance surface for outdoor activities. However, flagstone patios can suffer from time to time from large gaps and cracks due to wear and tear, extreme temperatures, or other causes. Fortunately, there are easy and affordable ways of filling these gaps and cracks to keep your flagstone patio looking its best.
