<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) is a popular open-world game from Rockstar Games, and it has plenty of exciting activities that you can do while riding your horse. But it can be difficult to keep your horse calm while you’re riding, especially if you’re in a hurry. So how do you keep your horse calm while riding RDR2?</p>

<h2>1. Be Gentle With Your Horse</h2>

<p>The first key to keeping your horse calm while riding RDR2 is to be gentle with it. If you’re too rough or aggressive, your horse can become spooked, which can make it difficult to control. So when you’re riding, use gentle guiding movements and try to avoid jerking the reins or spurring your horse too harshly. </p>

<h2>2. Don’t Rush Your Horse</h2>

<p>The second key to calming your horse down while riding RDR2 is to avoid rushing it. If you’re in a hurry, it may be tempting to push your horse to go faster, but this can make it even more agitated. Instead, try to take your time and keep your horse at a steady pace. This will help to keep it calm and make it easier to control.</p>

<h2>3. Slow Down When Approaching Obstacles</h2>

<p>When you’re riding your horse in RDR2, you’ll come across plenty of obstacles that you’ll need to navigate around.

If you’re in a rush, it’s easy to forget to slow down, so make sure to keep this in mind when riding.</p>

<h2>4. Give Your Horse Breaks</h2>

<p>It’s also important to give your horse regular breaks while riding RDR2. If you’re riding for an extended period of time, take a few minutes to stop and let your horse rest. This will help to keep it calm and give it a chance to recover from the exertion.</p>
