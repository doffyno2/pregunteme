<p>Raleigh is one of the most iconic bicycle brands in the world, and their bikes have a long and interesting history. Knowing the age of a Raleigh bike can be a challenge, but with a few simple steps it can be done. In this article, we’ll go over everything you need to know about how to tell the age of your Raleigh bike.</p>

<h2>How to Identify the Age of a Raleigh Bike</h2>

<p>There are several ways to determine the age of a Raleigh bike, and it all starts with the bike’s serial number. The serial number can typically be found on the underside of the bottom bracket shell, which is the part of the frame that holds the crankset. The serial number is usually five or six digits long. It is important to note that not all Raleigh bikes have serial numbers, so if you don’t see one, don’t worry—it doesn’t necessarily mean that your bike is too old to be identified.</p>

<p>Once you have the serial number, you can use it to identify the age of your Raleigh bike. The first two digits of the serial number indicate the year in which the bike was made. So, for example, if the first two digits are “18,” then your bike was made in 2018. The last three digits indicate the month and day, in the order of MM-DD. So, for example, if the last three digits are “617,” then your bike was made on June 17th of the indicated year.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this system of determining the age of a Raleigh bike only applies to bikes made from 1981 to the present day. If your bike was made before 1981, then you will need to look for other clues to determine its age. Some common indicators of a bike’s age include the type of brakes, the number of gears, and the type of shifters.</p>

<h2>What to Look for When Identifying the Age of a Raleigh Bike</h2>

<p>In addition to the serial number, there are several other clues that you can use to determine the age of your Raleigh bike. Here are some of the most common indicators:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Brakes</b>: Look for the type of brakes that the bike has. Older bikes typically have cantilever or side-pull brakes, while newer bikes often have disk brakes.</li>
  <li><b>Gears</b>: Check the number of gears on the bike. Older bikes often have three, five, or seven gears, while newer bikes often have nine, eleven, or even more gears.</li>
  <li><b>Shifters</b>: Look for the type of shifters that the bike has. Older bikes often have bar-end shifters, while newer bikes often have grip shifters or trigger shifters.</li>
  <li><b>Frame materials</b>: Look for the type of frame material that the bike has. Older bikes often have steel or aluminum frames, while newer bikes often have carbon fiber or titanium frames.</li>
</ul>

<p>By looking for these indicators, you can get a good idea of how old your Raleigh bike is. It is also important to note that some older Raleigh bikes may have been updated with newer components, so this might affect the age of the bike as well.</p>

The company’s website has a section where you can enter the serial number of your bike and get more information about it. This includes the model name, the year it was made, and the type of components that it has.
